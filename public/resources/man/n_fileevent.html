<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This command is
used to create <i>file event handlers</i>. A file event
handler is a binding between a channel and a script, such
that the script is evaluated whenever the channel becomes
readable or writable. File event handlers are most commonly
used to allow data to be received from another process on an
event-driven basis, so that the receiver can continue to
interact with the user while waiting for the data to arrive.
If an application invokes <b>gets</b> or <b>read</b> on a
blocking channel when there is no input data available, the
process will block; until the input data arrives, it will
not be able to service other events, so it will appear to
the user to &ldquo;freeze up&rdquo;. With <b>fileevent</b>,
the process can tell when data is present and only invoke
<b>gets</b> or <b>read</b> when they will not block.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>channelId</i> argument to <b>fileevent</b> refers to an
open channel such as a Tcl standard channel (<b>stdin</b>,
<b>stdout</b>, or <b>stderr</b>), the return value from an
invocation of <b>open</b> or <b>socket</b>, or the result of
a channel creation command provided by a Tcl extension.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the
<i>script</i> argument is specified, then <b>fileevent</b>
creates a new event handler: <i>script</i> will be evaluated
whenever the channel becomes readable or writable (depending
on the second argument to <b>fileevent</b>). In this case
<b>fileevent</b> returns an empty string. The
<b>readable</b> and <b>writable</b> event handlers for a
file are independent, and may be created and deleted
separately. However, there may be at most one
<b>readable</b> and one <b>writable</b> handler for a file
at a given time in a given interpreter. If <b>fileevent</b>
is called when the specified handler already exists in the
invoking interpreter, the new script replaces the old
one.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the
<i>script</i> argument is not specified, <b>fileevent</b>
returns the current script for <i>channelId</i>, or an empty
string if there is none. If the <i>script</i> argument is
specified as an empty string then the event handler is
deleted, so that no script will be invoked. A file event
handler is also deleted automatically whenever its channel
is closed or its interpreter is deleted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A channel is
considered to be readable if there is unread data available
on the underlying device. A channel is also considered to be
readable if there is unread data in an input buffer, except
in the special case where the most recent attempt to read
from the channel was a <b>gets</b> call that could not find
a complete line in the input buffer. This feature allows a
file to be read a line at a time in nonblocking mode using
events. A channel is also considered to be readable if an
end of file or error condition is present on the underlying
file or device. It is important for <i>script</i> to check
for these conditions and handle them appropriately; for
example, if there is no special check for end of file, an
infinite loop may occur where <i>script</i> reads no data,
returns, and is immediately invoked again.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A channel is
considered to be writable if at least one byte of data can
be written to the underlying file or device without
blocking, or if an error condition is present on the
underlying file or device.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Event-driven
I/O works best for channels that have been placed into
nonblocking mode with the <b>fconfigure</b> command. In
blocking mode, a <b>puts</b> command may block if you give
it more data than the underlying file or device can accept,
and a <b>gets</b> or <b>read</b> command will block if you
attempt to read more data than is ready; no events will be
processed while the commands block. In nonblocking mode
<b>puts</b>, <b>read</b>, and <b>gets</b> never block. See
the documentation for the individual commands for
information on how they handle blocking and nonblocking
channels.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The script for
a file event is executed at global level (outside the
context of any Tcl procedure) in the interpreter in which
the <b>fileevent</b> command was invoked. If an error occurs
while executing the script then the command registered with
<b>interp bgerror</b> is used to report the error. In
addition, the file event handler is deleted if it ever
returns an error; this is done in order to prevent infinite
loops due to buggy handlers.</p>

<h2>EXAMPLE
<a name="EXAMPLE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In this setup
<b>GetData</b> will be called with the channel as an
argument whenever $chan becomes readable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">proc GetData {chan} { <br>
if {![eof $chan]} { <br>
puts [gets $chan] <br>
} <br>
}</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>fileevent</b>
$chan readable [list GetData $chan]</p>
