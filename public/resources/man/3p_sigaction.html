<h2>SYNOPSIS

</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>#include
&lt;signal.h&gt;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>int
sigaction(int</b> <i>sig</i><b>, const struct sigaction
*restrict</b> <i>act</i><b>,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
struct sigaction *restrict</b> <i>oact</i><b>);</b></p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>sigaction</i>() function allows the calling process to
examine and/or specify the action to be associated with a
specific signal. The argument <i>sig</i> specifies the
signal; acceptable values are defined in
<i>&lt;signal.h&gt;</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The structure
<b>sigaction</b>, used to describe an action to be taken, is
defined in the <i>&lt;signal.h&gt;</i> header to include at
least the following members:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The storage
occupied by <i>sa_handler</i> and <i>sa_sigaction</i> may
overlap, and a conforming application shall not use both
simultaneously.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the argument
<i>act</i> is not a null pointer, it points to a structure
specifying the action to be associated with the specified
signal. If the argument <i>oact</i> is not a null pointer,
the action previously associated with the signal is stored
in the location pointed to by the argument <i>oact</i>. If
the argument <i>act</i> is a null pointer, signal handling
is unchanged; thus, the call can be used to enquire about
the current handling of a given signal. The SIGKILL and
SIGSTOP signals shall not be added to the signal mask using
this mechanism; this restriction shall be enforced by the
system without causing an error to be indicated.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the
SA_SIGINFO flag (see below) is cleared in the
<i>sa_flags</i> field of the <b>sigaction</b> structure, the
<i>sa_handler</i> field identifies the action to be
associated with the specified signal. If the SA_SIGINFO flag
is set in the <i>sa_flags</i> field, and the implementation
supports the Realtime Signals Extension option or the XSI
Extension option, the <i>sa_sigaction</i> field specifies a
signal-catching function. If the SA_SIGINFO bit is cleared
and the <i>sa_handler</i> field specifies a signal-catching
function, or if the SA_SIGINFO bit is set, the
<i>sa_mask</i> field identifies a set of signals that shall
be added to the signal mask of the thread before the
signal-catching function is invoked. If the
<i>sa_handler</i> field specifies a signal-catching
function, the <i>sa_mask</i> field identifies a set of
signals that shall be added to the process&rsquo; signal
mask before the signal-catching function is invoked.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>sa_flags</i> field can be used to modify the behavior of
the specified signal.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
flags, defined in the <i>&lt;signal.h&gt;</i> header, can be
set in <i>sa_flags</i>: <br>
SA_NOCLDSTOP</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Do not generate SIGCHLD when
children stop or stopped children continue.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If <i>sig</i>
is SIGCHLD and the SA_NOCLDSTOP flag is not set in
<i>sa_flags</i>, and the implementation supports the SIGCHLD
signal, then a SIGCHLD signal shall be generated for the
calling process whenever any of its child processes stop and
a SIGCHLD signal may be generated for the calling process
whenever any of its stopped child processes are continued.
If <i>sig</i> is SIGCHLD and the SA_NOCLDSTOP flag is set in
<i>sa_flags</i>, then the implementation shall not generate
a SIGCHLD signal in this way. <br>
SA_ONSTACK</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If set and an alternate signal
stack has been declared with <i>sigaltstack</i>(), the
signal shall be delivered to the calling process on that
stack. Otherwise, the signal shall be delivered on the
current stack.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">SA_RESETHAND</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If set, the disposition of the
signal shall be reset to SIG_DFL and the SA_SIGINFO flag
shall be cleared on entry to the signal handler.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="7%">


<p><b>Note:</b></p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>SIGILL and SIGTRAP cannot be automatically reset when
delivered; the system silently enforces this
restriction.</p> </td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Otherwise, the
disposition of the signal shall not be modified on entry to
the signal handler.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In addition, if
this flag is set, <i>sigaction</i>() behaves as if the
SA_NODEFER flag were also set. <br>
SA_RESTART</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This flag affects the behavior
of interruptible functions; that is, those specified to fail
with <i>errno</i> set to [EINTR]. If set, and a function
specified as interruptible is interrupted by this signal,
the function shall restart and shall not fail with [EINTR]
unless otherwise specified. If the flag is not set,
interruptible functions interrupted by this signal shall
fail with <i>errno</i> set to [EINTR].</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">SA_SIGINFO</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If cleared and the signal is
caught, the signal-catching function shall be entered
as:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>void
func(int</b> <i>signo</i><b>);</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">where
<i>signo</i> is the only argument to the signal-catching
function. In this case, the application shall use the
<i>sa_handler</i> member to describe the signal-catching
function and the application shall not modify the
<i>sa_sigaction</i> member.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If SA_SIGINFO
is set and the signal is caught, the signal-catching
function shall be entered as:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>void
func(int</b> <i>signo</i><b>, siginfo_t *</b><i>info</i><b>,
void *</b><i>context</i><b>);</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">where two
additional arguments are passed to the signal-catching
function. The second argument shall point to an object of
type <b>siginfo_t</b> explaining the reason why the signal
was generated; the third argument can be cast to a pointer
to an object of type <b>ucontext_t</b> to refer to the
receiving process&rsquo; context that was interrupted when
the signal was delivered. In this case, the application
shall use the <i>sa_sigaction</i> member to describe the
signal-catching function and the application shall not
modify the <i>sa_handler</i> member.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>si_signo</i> member contains the system-generated signal
number.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>si_errno</i> member may contain implementation-defined
additional error information; if non-zero, it contains an
error number identifying the condition that caused the
signal to be generated.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>si_code</i> member contains a code identifying the cause
of the signal.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the value of
<i>si_code</i> is less than or equal to 0, then the signal
was generated by a process and <i>si_pid</i> and
<i>si_uid</i>, respectively, indicate the process ID and the
real user ID of the sender. The <i>&lt;signal.h&gt;</i>
header description contains information about the
signal-specific contents of the elements of the
<b>siginfo_t</b> type. <br>
SA_NOCLDWAIT</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If set, and <i>sig</i> equals
SIGCHLD, child processes of the calling processes shall not
be transformed into zombie processes when they terminate. If
the calling process subsequently waits for its children, and
the process has no unwaited-for children that were
transformed into zombie processes, it shall block until all
of its children terminate, and <i>wait</i>(),
<i>waitid</i>(), and <i>waitpid</i>() shall fail and set
<i>errno</i> to [ECHILD]. Otherwise, terminating child
processes shall be transformed into zombie processes, unless
SIGCHLD is set to SIG_IGN.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">SA_NODEFER</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If set and <i>sig</i> is
caught, <i>sig</i> shall not be added to the process&rsquo;
signal mask on entry to the signal handler unless it is
included in <i>sa_mask</i>. Otherwise, <i>sig</i> shall
always be added to the process&rsquo; signal mask on entry
to the signal handler.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When a signal
is caught by a signal-catching function installed by
<i>sigaction</i>(), a new signal mask is calculated and
installed for the duration of the signal-catching function
(or until a call to either <i>sigprocmask</i>() or
<i>sigsuspend</i>() is made). This mask is formed by taking
the union of the current signal mask and the value of the
<i>sa_mask</i> for the signal being delivered unless
SA_NODEFER or SA_RESETHAND is set, and then including the
signal being delivered. If and when the user&rsquo;s signal
handler returns normally, the original signal mask is
restored.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Once an action
is installed for a specific signal, it shall remain
installed until another action is explicitly requested (by
another call to <i>sigaction</i>()), until the SA_RESETHAND
flag causes resetting of the handler, or until one of the
<i>exec</i> functions is called.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the previous
action for <i>sig</i> had been established by
<i>signal</i>(), the values of the fields returned in the
structure pointed to by <i>oact</i> are unspecified, and in
particular <i>oact</i>-&gt; <i>sa_handler</i> is not
necessarily the same value passed to <i>signal</i>().
However, if a pointer to the same structure or a copy
thereof is passed to a subsequent call to <i>sigaction</i>()
via the <i>act</i> argument, handling of the signal shall be
as if the original call to <i>signal</i>() were
repeated.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If
<i>sigaction</i>() fails, no new signal handler is
installed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is
unspecified whether an attempt to set the action for a
signal that cannot be caught or ignored to SIG_DFL is
ignored or causes an error to be returned with <i>errno</i>
set to [EINVAL].</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If SA_SIGINFO
is not set in <i>sa_flags</i>, then the disposition of
subsequent occurrences of <i>sig</i> when it is already
pending is implementation-defined; the signal-catching
function shall be invoked with a single argument. If the
implementation supports the Realtime Signals Extension
option, and if SA_SIGINFO is set in <i>sa_flags</i>, then
subsequent occurrences of <i>sig</i> generated by
<i>sigqueue</i>() or as a result of any signal-generating
function that supports the specification of an
application-defined value (when <i>sig</i> is already
pending) shall be queued in FIFO order until delivered or
accepted; the signal-catching function shall be invoked with
three arguments. The application specified value is passed
to the signal-catching function as the <i>si_value</i>
member of the <b>siginfo_t</b> structure.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The result of
the use of <i>sigaction</i>() and a <i>sigwait</i>()
function concurrently within a process on the same signal is
unspecified.</p>

<h2>RETURN VALUE
<a name="RETURN VALUE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Upon successful
completion, <i>sigaction</i>() shall return 0; otherwise, -1
shall be returned, <i>errno</i> shall be set to indicate the
error, and no new signal-catching function shall be
installed.</p>

<h2>EXAMPLES
<a name="EXAMPLES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">None.</p>

<h2>APPLICATION USAGE
<a name="APPLICATION USAGE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>sigaction</i>() function supersedes the <i>signal</i>()
function, and should be used in preference. In particular,
<i>sigaction</i>() and <i>signal</i>() should not be used in
the same process to control the same signal. The behavior of
reentrant functions, as defined in the DESCRIPTION, is as
specified by this volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001,
regardless of invocation from a signal-catching function.
This is the only intended meaning of the statement that
reentrant functions may be used in signal-catching functions
without restrictions. Applications must still consider all
effects of such functions on such things as data structures,
files, and process state. In particular, application writers
need to consider the restrictions on interactions when
interrupting <i>sleep</i>() and interactions among multiple
handles for a file description. The fact that any specific
function is listed as reentrant does not necessarily mean
that invocation of that function from a signal-catching
function is recommended.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In order to
prevent errors arising from interrupting non-reentrant
function calls, applications should protect calls to these
functions either by blocking the appropriate signals or
through the use of some programmatic semaphore (see
<i>semget</i>(), <i>sem_init</i>(), <i>sem_open</i>(), and
so on). Note in particular that even the &quot;safe&quot;
functions may modify <i>errno</i>; the signal-catching
function, if not executing as an independent thread, may
want to save and restore its value. Naturally, the same
principles apply to the reentrancy of application routines
and asynchronous data access. Note that <i>longjmp</i>() and
<i>siglongjmp</i>() are not in the list of reentrant
functions. This is because the code executing after
<i>longjmp</i>() and <i>siglongjmp</i>() can call any unsafe
functions with the same danger as calling those unsafe
functions directly from the signal handler. Applications
that use <i>longjmp</i>() and <i>siglongjmp</i>() from
within signal handlers require rigorous protection in order
to be portable. Many of the other functions that are
excluded from the list are traditionally implemented using
either <i>malloc</i>() or <i>free</i>() functions or the
standard I/O library, both of which traditionally use data
structures in a non-reentrant manner. Since any combination
of different functions using a common data structure can
cause reentrancy problems, this volume of
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 does not define the behavior
when any unsafe function is called in a signal handler that
interrupts an unsafe function.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the signal
occurs other than as the result of calling <i>abort</i>(),
<i>kill</i>(), or <i>raise</i>(), the behavior is undefined
if the signal handler calls any function in the standard
library other than one of the functions listed in the table
above or refers to any object with static storage duration
other than by assigning a value to a static storage duration
variable of type <b>volatile sig_atomic_t</b>. Furthermore,
if such a call fails, the value of <i>errno</i> is
unspecified.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Usually, the
signal is executed on the stack that was in effect before
the signal was delivered. An alternate stack may be
specified to receive a subset of the signals being
caught.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When the signal
handler returns, the receiving process resumes execution at
the point it was interrupted unless the signal handler makes
other arrangements. If <i>longjmp</i>() or <i>_longjmp</i>()
is used to leave the signal handler, then the signal mask
must be explicitly restored by the process.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This volume of
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 defines the third argument of
a signal handling function when SA_SIGINFO is set as a
<b>void *</b> instead of a <b>ucontext_t *</b>, but without
requiring type checking. New applications should explicitly
cast the third argument of the signal handling function to
<b>ucontext_t *</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The BSD
optional four argument signal handling function is not
supported by this volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001.
The BSD declaration would be:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>void
handler(int</b> <i>sig</i><b>, int</b> <i>code</i><b>,
struct sigcontext *</b><i>scp</i><b>, <br>
char *</b><i>addr</i><b>);</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">where
<i>sig</i> is the signal number, <i>code</i> is additional
information on certain signals, <i>scp</i> is a pointer to
the <b>sigcontext</b> structure, and <i>addr</i> is
additional address information. Much the same information is
available in the objects pointed to by the second argument
of the signal handler specified when SA_SIGINFO is set.</p>

<h2>RATIONALE
<a name="RATIONALE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Although this
volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires that
signals that cannot be ignored shall not be added to the
signal mask when a signal-catching function is entered,
there is no explicit requirement that subsequent calls to
<i>sigaction</i>() reflect this in the information returned
in the <i>oact</i> argument. In other words, if SIGKILL is
included in the <i>sa_mask</i> field of <i>act</i>, it is
unspecified whether or not a subsequent call to
<i>sigaction</i>() returns with SIGKILL included in the
<i>sa_mask</i> field of <i>oact</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
SA_NOCLDSTOP flag, when supplied in the <i>act</i>-&gt;
<i>sa_flags</i> parameter, allows overloading SIGCHLD with
the System V semantics that each SIGCLD signal indicates a
single terminated child. Most conforming applications that
catch SIGCHLD are expected to install signal-catching
functions that repeatedly call the <i>waitpid</i>() function
with the WNOHANG flag set, acting on each child for which
status is returned, until <i>waitpid</i>() returns zero. If
stopped children are not of interest, the use of the
SA_NOCLDSTOP flag can prevent the overhead from invoking the
signal-catching routine when they stop.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Some historical
implementations also define other mechanisms for stopping
processes, such as the <i>ptrace</i>() function. These
implementations usually do not generate a SIGCHLD signal
when processes stop due to this mechanism; however, that is
beyond the scope of this volume of
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This volume of
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires that calls to
<i>sigaction</i>() that supply a NULL <i>act</i> argument
succeed, even in the case of signals that cannot be caught
or ignored (that is, SIGKILL or SIGSTOP). The System V
<i>signal</i>() and BSD <i>sigvec</i>() functions return
[EINVAL] in these cases and, in this respect, their behavior
varies from <i>sigaction</i>().</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This volume of
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires that
<i>sigaction</i>() properly save and restore a signal action
set up by the ISO&nbsp;C standard <i>signal</i>() function.
However, there is no guarantee that the reverse is true, nor
could there be given the greater amount of information
conveyed by the <b>sigaction</b> structure. Because of this,
applications should avoid using both functions for the same
signal in the same process. Since this cannot always be
avoided in case of general-purpose library routines, they
should always be implemented with <i>sigaction</i>().</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It was intended
that the <i>signal</i>() function should be implementable as
a library routine using <i>sigaction</i>().</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The POSIX
Realtime Extension extends the <i>sigaction</i>() function
as specified by the POSIX.1-1990 standard to allow the
application to request on a per-signal basis via an
additional signal action flag that the extra parameters,
including the application-defined signal value, if any, be
passed to the signal-catching function.</p>
