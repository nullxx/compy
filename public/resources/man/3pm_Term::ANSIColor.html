<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This module has
two interfaces, one through <i>color()</i> and
<i>colored()</i> and the other through constants. It also
offers the utility functions <i>uncolor()</i>,
<i>colorstrip()</i>, and <i>colorvalid()</i>, which have to
be explicitly imported to be used (see &quot;
<small>SYNOPSIS</small> &quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Supported
Colors</b> <br>
Terminal emulators that support color divide into two types:
ones that support only eight colors, and ones that support
sixteen. This module provides both the <small>ANSI</small>
escape codes for the &quot;normal&quot; colors, supported by
both types, as well as the additional colors supported by
sixteen-color emulators. These colors are referred to as
<small>ANSI</small> colors 0 through 7 (normal) and 8
through 15.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Unfortunately,
interpretation of colors 0 through 7 often depends on
whether the emulator supports eight colors or sixteen
colors. Emulators that only support eight colors (such as
the Linux console) will display colors 0 through 7 with
normal brightness and ignore colors 8 through 15, treating
them the same as white. Emulators that support 16 colors,
such as gnome-terminal, normally display colors 0 through 7
as dim or darker versions and colors 8 through 15 as normal
brightness. On such emulators, the &quot;normal&quot; white
(color 7) usually is shown as pale grey, requiring bright
white (15) to be used to get a real white color. Bright
black usually is a dark grey color, although some terminals
display it as pure black. Some sixteen-color terminal
emulators also treat normal yellow (color 3) as orange or
brown, and bright yellow (color 11) as yellow.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Following the
normal convention of sixteen-color emulators, this module
provides a pair of attributes for each color. For every
normal color (0 through 7), the corresponding bright color
(8 through 15) is obtained by prepending the string
<tt>&quot;bright_&quot;</tt> to the normal color name. For
example, <tt>&quot;red&quot;</tt> is color 1 and
<tt>&quot;bright_red&quot;</tt> is color 9. The same applies
for background colors: <tt>&quot;on_red&quot;</tt> is the
normal color and <tt>&quot;on_bright_red&quot;</tt> is the
bright color. Capitalize these strings for the constant
interface.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There is
unfortunately no way to know whether the current emulator
supports sixteen colors or not, which makes the choice of
colors difficult. The most conservative choice is to use
only the regular colors, which are at least displayed on all
emulators. However, they will appear dark in sixteen-color
terminal emulators, including most common emulators in
<small>UNIX</small> X environments. If you know the display
is one of those emulators, you may wish to use the bright
variants instead. Even better, offer the user a way to
configure the colors for a given application to fit their
terminal emulator.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Support for
colors 8 through 15 (the <tt>&quot;bright_&quot;</tt>
variants) was added in Term::ANSIColor 3.0.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Function
Interface</b> <br>
The function interface uses attribute strings to describe
the colors and text attributes to assign to text. The
recognized non-color attributes are clear, reset, bold,
dark, faint, underline, underscore, blink, reverse, and
concealed. Clear and reset (reset to default attributes),
dark and faint (dim and saturated), and underline and
underscore are equivalent, so use whichever is the most
intuitive to you.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that not
all attributes are supported by all terminal types, and some
terminals may not support any of these sequences. Dark and
faint, blink, and concealed in particular are frequently not
implemented.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The recognized
normal foreground color attributes (colors 0 to 7) are:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  black  red  green  yellow  blue  magenta  cyan  white</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
corresponding bright foreground color attributes (colors 8
to 15) are:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  bright_black  bright_red      bright_green  bright_yellow
  bright_blue   bright_magenta  bright_cyan   bright_white</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The recognized
normal background color attributes (colors 0 to 7) are:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  on_black  on_red      on_green  on yellow
  on_blue   on_magenta  on_cyan   on_white</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The recognized
bright background color attributes (colors 8 to 15) are:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  on_bright_black  on_bright_red      on_bright_green  on_bright_yellow
  on_bright_blue   on_bright_magenta  on_bright_cyan   on_bright_white</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For any of the
above listed attributes, case is not significant.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Attributes,
once set, last until they are unset (by printing the
attribute <tt>&quot;clear&quot;</tt> or
<tt>&quot;reset&quot;</tt>). Be careful to do this, or
otherwise your attribute will last after your script is done
running, and people get very annoyed at having their prompt
and typing changed to weird colors. <br>
color(ATTR[, <small>ATTR</small> ...])</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><i>color()</i> takes any number
of strings as arguments and considers them to be
space-separated lists of attributes. It then forms and
returns the escape sequence to set those attributes. It
doesn&rsquo;t print it out, just returns it, so you&rsquo;ll
have to print it yourself if you want to. This is so that
you can save it as a string, pass it to something else, send
it to a file handle, or do anything else with it that you
might care to. <i>color()</i> throws an exception if given
an invalid attribute.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">colored( <small>STRING</small>
, <small>ATTRIBUTES</small> ) <br>
colored( <small>ATTR&minus;REF</small> , STRING[,
<small>STRING</small> ...])</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">As an aid in resetting colors,
<i>colored()</i> takes a scalar as the first argument and
any number of attribute strings as the second argument and
returns the scalar wrapped in escape codes so that the
attributes will be set as requested before the string and
reset to normal after the string. Alternately, you can pass
a reference to an array as the first argument, and then the
contents of that array will be taken as attributes and color
codes and the remainder of the arguments as text to
colorize.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Normally,
<i>colored()</i> just puts attribute codes at the beginning
and end of the string, but if you set
<tt>$Term::ANSIColor::EACHLINE</tt> to some string, that
string will be considered the line delimiter and the
attribute will be set at the beginning of each line of the
passed string and reset at the end of each line. This is
often desirable if the output contains newlines and
you&rsquo;re using background colors, since a background
color that persists across a newline is often interpreted by
the terminal as providing the default background color for
the next line. Programs like pagers can also be confused by
attributes that span lines. Normally you&rsquo;ll want to
set <tt>$Term::ANSIColor::EACHLINE</tt> to
<tt>&quot;\n&quot;</tt> to use this feature.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">uncolor( <small>ESCAPE</small>
)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><i>uncolor()</i> performs the
opposite translation as <i>color()</i>, turning escape
sequences into a list of strings corresponding to the
attributes being set by those sequences.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">colorstrip(STRING[,
<small>STRING</small> ...])</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><i>colorstrip()</i> removes all
color escape sequences from the provided strings, returning
the modified strings separately in array context or joined
together in scalar context. Its arguments are not
modified.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">colorvalid(ATTR[,
<small>ATTR</small> ...])</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><i>colorvalid()</i> takes
attribute strings the same as <i>color()</i> and returns
true if all attributes are known and false otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Constant
Interface</b> <br>
Alternately, if you import <tt>&quot;:constants&quot;</tt>,
you can use the following constants directly:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  CLEAR           RESET             BOLD            DARK
  FAINT           UNDERLINE         UNDERSCORE      BLINK
  REVERSE         CONCEALED
  BLACK           RED               GREEN           YELLOW
  BLUE            MAGENTA           CYAN            WHITE
  BRIGHT_BLACK    BRIGHT_RED        BRIGHT_GREEN    BRIGHT_YELLOW
  BRIGHT_BLUE     BRIGHT_MAGENTA    BRIGHT_CYAN     BRIGHT_WHITE
  ON_BLACK        ON_RED            ON_GREEN        ON_YELLOW
  ON_BLUE         ON_MAGENTA        ON_CYAN         ON_WHITE
  ON_BRIGHT_BLACK ON_BRIGHT_RED     ON_BRIGHT_GREEN ON_BRIGHT_YELLOW
  ON_BRIGHT_BLUE  ON_BRIGHT_MAGENTA ON_BRIGHT_CYAN  ON_BRIGHT_WHITE</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These are the
same as color(&rsquo;attribute&rsquo;) and can be used if
you prefer typing:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    print BOLD BLUE ON_WHITE &quot;Text&quot;, RESET, &quot;\n&quot;;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">to</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    print colored (&quot;Text&quot;, 'bold blue on_white'), &quot;\n&quot;;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">(Note that the
newline is kept separate to avoid confusing the terminal as
described above since a background color is being used.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When using the
constants, if you don&rsquo;t want to have to remember to
add the <tt>&quot;, RESET&quot;</tt> at the end of each
print line, you can set <tt>$Term::ANSIColor::AUTORESET</tt>
to a true value. Then, the display mode will automatically
be reset if there is no comma after the constant. In other
words, with that variable set:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    print BOLD BLUE &quot;Text\n&quot;;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">will reset the
display mode afterward, whereas:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    print BOLD, BLUE, &quot;Text\n&quot;;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">will not. If
you are using background colors, you will probably want to
print the newline with a separate print statement to avoid
confusing the terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The subroutine
interface has the advantage over the constants interface in
that only two subroutines are exported into your namespace,
versus thirty-eight in the constants interface. On the flip
side, the constants interface has the advantage of better
compile time error checking, since misspelled names of
colors or attributes in calls to <i>color()</i> and
<i>colored()</i> won&rsquo;t be caught until runtime whereas
misspelled names of constants will be caught at compile
time. So, pollute your namespace with almost two dozen
subroutines that you may not even use that often, or risk a
silly bug by mistyping an attribute. Your choice,
<small>TMTOWTDI</small> after all.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>The Color
Stack</b> <br>
As of Term::ANSIColor 2.0, you can import
<tt>&quot;:pushpop&quot;</tt> and maintain a stack of colors
using <small>PUSHCOLOR</small> , <small>POPCOLOR</small> ,
and <small>LOCALCOLOR</small> . <small>PUSHCOLOR</small>
takes the attribute string that starts its argument and
pushes it onto a stack of attributes.
<small>POPCOLOR</small> removes the top of the stack and
restores the previous attributes set by the argument of a
prior <small>PUSHCOLOR</small> . <small>LOCALCOLOR</small>
surrounds its argument in a <small>PUSHCOLOR</small> and
<small>POPCOLOR</small> so that the color resets
afterward.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When using
<small>PUSHCOLOR</small> , <small>POPCOLOR</small> , and
<small>LOCALCOLOR</small> , it&rsquo;s particularly
important to not put commas between the constants.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    print PUSHCOLOR BLUE &quot;Text\n&quot;;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">will correctly
push <small>BLUE</small> onto the top of the stack.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    print PUSHCOLOR, BLUE, &quot;Text\n&quot;;    # wrong!</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">will not, and a
subsequent pop won&rsquo;t restore the correct attributes.
<small>PUSHCOLOR</small> pushes the attributes set by its
argument, which is normally a string of color constants. It
can&rsquo;t ask the terminal what the current attributes
are.</p>

<h2>DIAGNOSTICS
<a name="DIAGNOSTICS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Bad escape
sequence %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You passed an invalid
<small>ANSI</small> escape sequence to <i>uncolor()</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Bareword &quot;%s&quot; not
allowed while &quot;strict subs&quot; in use</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You probably mistyped a
constant color name such as:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    $Foobar = FOOBAR . &quot;This line should be blue\n&quot;;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">or:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    @Foobar = FOOBAR, &quot;This line should be blue\n&quot;;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This will only
show up under use strict (another good reason to run under
use strict).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Invalid attribute name %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You passed an invalid
attribute name to either <i>color()</i> or
<i>colored()</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Name &quot;%s&quot; used only
once: possible typo</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W) You probably mistyped a
constant color name such as:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    print FOOBAR &quot;This text is color FOOBAR\n&quot;;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">It&rsquo;s
probably better to always use commas after constant names in
order to force the next error.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">No comma allowed after
filehandle</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You probably mistyped a
constant color name such as:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    print FOOBAR, &quot;This text is color FOOBAR\n&quot;;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Generating this
fatal compile error is one of the main advantages of using
the constants interface, since you&rsquo;ll immediately know
if you mistype a color name.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">No name for escape sequence
%s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The <small>ANSI</small>
escape sequence passed to <i>uncolor()</i> contains escapes
which aren&rsquo;t recognized and can&rsquo;t be translated
to names.</p>

<h2>ENVIRONMENT
<a name="ENVIRONMENT"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><small>ANSI_COLORS_DISABLED</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">If this environment variable is
set, all of the functions defined by this module
(<i>color()</i>, <i>colored()</i>, and all of the constants
not previously used in the program) will not output any
escape sequences and instead will just return the empty
string or pass through the original text as appropriate.
This is intended to support easy use of scripts using this
module on platforms that don&rsquo;t support
<small>ANSI</small> escape sequences.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">For it to have
its proper effect, this environment variable must be set
before any color constants are used in the program.</p>

<h2>RESTRICTIONS
<a name="RESTRICTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It would be
nice if one could leave off the commas around the constants
entirely and just say:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    print BOLD BLUE ON_WHITE &quot;Text\n&quot; RESET;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">but the syntax
of Perl doesn&rsquo;t allow this. You need a comma after the
string. (Of course, you may consider it a bug that commas
between all the constants aren&rsquo;t required, in which
case you may feel free to insert commas unless you&rsquo;re
using <tt>$Term::ANSIColor::AUTORESET</tt> or
<small>PUSHCOLOR/POPCOLOR</small> .)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For easier
debugging, you may prefer to always use the commas when not
setting <tt>$Term::ANSIColor::AUTORESET</tt> or
<small>PUSHCOLOR/POPCOLOR</small> so that you&rsquo;ll get a
fatal compile error rather than a warning.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It&rsquo;s not
possible to use this module to embed formatting and color
attributes using Perl formats. They replace the escape
character with a space (as documented in
<i>perlform</i>(1)), resulting in garbled output from the
unrecognized attribute. Even if there were a way around that
problem, the format doesn&rsquo;t know that the non-printing
escape sequence is zero-length and would incorrectly format
the output. For formatted output using color or other
attributes, either use <i>sprintf()</i> instead or use
<i>formline()</i> and then add the color or other attributes
after formatting and before output.</p>

<h2>NOTES
<a name="NOTES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The codes
generated by this module are standard terminal control
codes, complying with <small>ECMA&minus;048</small> and
<small>ISO</small> 6429 (generally referred to as &quot;
<small>ANSI</small> color&quot; for the color codes). The
non-color control codes (bold, dark, italic, underline, and
reverse) are part of the earlier <small>ANSI</small> X3.64
standard for control sequences for video terminals and
peripherals.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that not
all displays are <small>ISO</small> 6429&minus;compliant, or
even X3.64&minus;compliant (or are even attempting to be
so). This module will not work as expected on displays that
do not honor these escape sequences, such as cmd.exe,
4nt.exe, and command.com under either Windows
<small>NT</small> or Windows 2000. They may just be ignored,
or they may display as an <small>ESC</small> character
followed by some apparent garbage.</p>

provided the following table of different common terminal
emulators and their support for the various attributes and

Windows telnet, Cygwin <small>SSH</small> is the OpenSSH
implementation under Cygwin on Windows <small>NT</small> ,
and Mac Terminal is the Terminal application in Mac
<small>OS</small> X. Where the entry is other than yes or
no, that emulator displays the given attribute as something
else instead. Note that on an aixterm, clear doesn&rsquo;t
reset colors; you have to explicitly set the colors back to
what you want. More entries in this table are welcome.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that codes
3 (italic), 6 (rapid blink), and 9 (strike-through) are
specified in <small>ANSI</small> X3.64 and
<small>ECMA&minus;048</small> but are not commonly supported
by most displays and emulators and therefore aren&rsquo;t
supported by this module at the present time.
<small>ECMA&minus;048</small> also specifies a large number
of other attributes, including a sequence of attributes for
font changes, Fraktur characters, double-underlining,
framing, circling, and overlining. As none of these
attributes are widely supported or useful, they also
aren&rsquo;t currently supported by this module.</p>

6429 is available from <small>ISO</small> for a charge; the
author of this module does not own a copy of it. Since the
source material for <small>ISO</small> 6429 was
<small>ECMA&minus;048</small> and the latter is available
for free, there seems little reason to obtain the
<small>ISO</small> standard.</p>
