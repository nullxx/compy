<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Preamble</b>
<br>
The intent of this document is to state the conditions under
which a Package may be copied, such that the Copyright
Holder maintains some semblance of artistic control over the
development of the package, while giving the users of the
package the right to use and distribute the Package in a
more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make
reasonable modifications.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Definitions</b>
<br>
&quot;Package&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">refers to the collection of
files distributed by the Copyright Holder, and derivatives
of that collection of files created through textual
modification.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot;Standard
Version&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">refers to such a Package if it
has not been modified, or has been modified in accordance
with the wishes of the Copyright Holder as specified
below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot;Copyright
Holder&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">is whoever is named in the
copyright or copyrights for the package.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot;You&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">is you, if you&rsquo;re
thinking about copying or distributing this Package.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot;Reasonable copying
fee&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">is whatever you can justify on
the basis of media cost, duplication charges, time of people
involved, and so on. (You will not be required to justify it
to the Copyright Holder, but only to the computing community
at large as a market that must bear the fee.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot;Freely
Available&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">means that no fee is charged
for the item itself, though there may be fees involved in
handling the item. It also means that recipients of the item
may redistribute it under the same conditions they received
it.</p>
