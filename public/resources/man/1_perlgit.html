Detailed information about git and the Perl repository</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This document
provides details on using git to develop Perl. If you are
just interested in working on a quick patch, see perlhack
first. This document is intended for people who are regular
contributors to Perl, including those with write access to
the git repository.</p>

<h2>CLONING THE REPOSITORY
<a name="CLONING THE REPOSITORY"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">All of
Perl&rsquo;s source code is kept centrally in a Git
repository at <i>perl5.git.perl.org</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can make a
read-only clone of the repository by running:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  % git clone git://perl5.git.perl.org/perl.git perl</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This uses the
git protocol (port 9418).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you cannot
use the git protocol for firewall reasons, you can also
clone via http, though this is much slower:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  % git clone http://perl5.git.perl.org/perl.git perl</pre>


<h2>WORKING WITH THE REPOSITORY
<a name="WORKING WITH THE REPOSITORY"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Once you have
changed into the repository directory, you can inspect it.
After a clone the repository will contain a single local
branch, which will be the current branch as well, as
indicated by the asterisk.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  % git branch
  * blead</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Using the
&minus;a switch to <tt>&quot;branch&quot;</tt> will also
show the remote tracking branches in the repository:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  % git branch &minus;a
  * blead
    origin/HEAD
    origin/blead
  ...</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The branches
that begin with &quot;origin&quot; correspond to the
&quot;git remote&quot; that you cloned from (which is named
&quot;origin&quot;). Each branch on the remote will be
exactly tracked by these branches. You should
<small>NEVER</small> do work on these remote tracking
branches. You only ever do work in a local branch. Local
branches can be configured to automerge (on pull) from a
designated remote tracking branch. This is the case with the
default branch <tt>&quot;blead&quot;</tt> which will be
configured to merge from the remote tracking branch
<tt>&quot;origin/blead&quot;</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can see
recent commits:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  % git log</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">And pull new
changes from the repository, and update your local
repository (must be clean first)</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  % git pull</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Assuming we are
on the branch <tt>&quot;blead&quot;</tt> immediately after a
pull, this command would be more or less equivalent to:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  % git fetch
  % git merge origin/blead</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In fact if you
want to update your local repository without touching your
working directory you do:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  % git fetch</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">And if you want
to update your remote-tracking branches for all defined
remotes simultaneously you can do</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  % git remote update</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Neither of
these last two commands will update your working directory,
however both will update the remote-tracking branches in
your repository.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To make a local
branch of a remote branch:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  % git checkout &minus;b maint&minus;5.10 origin/maint&minus;5.10</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To switch back
to blead:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  % git checkout blead</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Finding out
your status</b> <br>
The most common git command you will use will probably
be</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  % git status</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This command
will produce as output a description of the current state of
the repository, including modified files and unignored
untracked files, and in addition it will show things like
what files have been staged for the next commit, and usually
some useful information about how to change things. For
instance the following:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  $ git status
  # On branch blead
  # Your branch is ahead of 'origin/blead' by 1 commit.
  #
  # Changes to be committed:
  #   (use &quot;git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to unstage)
  #
  #       modified:   pod/perlgit.pod
  #
  # Changed but not updated:
  #   (use &quot;git add &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to update what will be committed)
  #
  #       modified:   pod/perlgit.pod
  #
  # Untracked files:
  #   (use &quot;git add &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to include in what will be committed)
  #
  #       deliberate.untracked</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This shows that
there were changes to this document staged for commit, and
that there were further changes in the working directory not
yet staged. It also shows that there was an untracked file
in the working directory, and as you can see shows how to
change all of this. It also shows that there is one commit
on the working branch <tt>&quot;blead&quot;</tt> which has
not been pushed to the <tt>&quot;origin&quot;</tt> remote
yet. <b><small>NOTE</small></b> : that this output is also
what you see as a template if you do not provide a message
to <tt>&quot;git commit&quot;</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Patch
workflow</b> <br>
First, please read perlhack for details on hacking the Perl
core. That document covers many details on how to create a
good patch.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you already
have a Perl repository, you should ensure that you&rsquo;re
on the <i>blead</i> branch, and your repository is up to
date:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  % git checkout blead
  % git pull</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It&rsquo;s
preferable to patch against the latest blead version, since
this is where new development occurs for all changes other
than critical bug fixes. Critical bug fix patches should be
made against the relevant maint branches, or should be
submitted with a note indicating all the branches where the
fix should be applied.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Now that we
have everything up to date, we need to create a temporary
new branch for these changes and switch into it:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  % git checkout &minus;b orange</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">which is the
short form of</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  % git branch orange
  % git checkout orange</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Creating a
topic branch makes it easier for the maintainers to rebase
or merge back into the master blead for a more linear
history. If you don&rsquo;t work on a topic branch the
maintainer has to manually cherry pick your changes onto
blead before they can be applied.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">That&rsquo;ll
get you scolded on perl5&minus;porters, so don&rsquo;t do
that. Be Awesome.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Then make your
changes. For example, if Leon Brocard changes his name to
Orange Brocard, we should change his name in the
<small>AUTHORS</small> file:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  % perl &minus;pi &minus;e 's{Leon Brocard}{Orange Brocard}' AUTHORS</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can see
what files are changed:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  % git status
  # On branch orange
  # Changes to be committed:
  #   (use &quot;git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to unstage)
  #
  #    modified:   AUTHORS
  #</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">And you can see
the changes:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  % git diff

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Now commit your

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  % git commit &minus;a &minus;m 'Rename Leon Brocard to Orange Brocard'
  Created commit 6196c1d: Rename Leon Brocard to Orange Brocard
   1 files changed, 1 insertions(+), 1 deletions(&minus;)</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<tt>&quot;&minus;a&quot;</tt> option is used to include all
files that git tracks that you have changed. If at this
time, you only want to commit some of the files you have
worked on, you can omit the <tt>&quot;&minus;a&quot;</tt>
and use the command
<tt>&quot;git&nbsp;add&nbsp;</tt><i>FILE&nbsp;...</i><tt>&quot;</tt>
before doing the commit.
<tt>&quot;git&nbsp;add&nbsp;&minus;&minus;interactive&quot;</tt>
allows you to even just commit portions of files instead of
all the changes in them.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<tt>&quot;&minus;m&quot;</tt> option is used to specify the
commit message. If you omit it, git will open a text editor
for you to compose the message interactively. This is useful
when the changes are more complex than the sample given
here, and, depending on the editor, to know that the first
line of the commit message doesn&rsquo;t exceed the 50
character legal maximum.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Once
you&rsquo;ve finished writing your commit message and exited
your editor, git will write your change to disk and tell you
something like this:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  Created commit daf8e63: explain git status and stuff about remotes
   1 files changed, 83 insertions(+), 3 deletions(&minus;)</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you re-run
<tt>&quot;git status&quot;</tt>, you should see something
like this:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  % git status
  # On branch blead
  # Your branch is ahead of 'origin/blead' by 2 commits.
  #
  # Untracked files:
  #   (use &quot;git add &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to include in what will be committed)
  #
  #       deliberate.untracked
  nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use &quot;git add&quot; to track)</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When in doubt,
before you do anything else, check your status and read it
carefully, many questions are answered directly by the git
status output.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can examine
your last commit with:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  % git show HEAD</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">and if you are
not happy with either the description or the patch itself
you can fix it up by editing the files once more and then
issue:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  % git commit &minus;a &minus;&minus;amend</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Now you should
create a patch file for all your local changes:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  % git format&minus;patch &minus;M origin..
  0001&minus;Rename&minus;Leon&minus;Brocard&minus;to&minus;Orange&minus;Brocard.patch</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You should now
send an email to perlbug@perl.org
&lt;mailto:perlbug@perl.org&gt; with a description of your
changes, and include this patch file as an attachment. In
addition to being tracked by <small>RT</small> , mail to
perlbug will automatically be forwarded to
perl5&minus;porters (with manual moderation, so please be
patient). You should only send patches to
perl5&minus;porters@perl.org
&lt;mailto:perl5-porters@perl.org&gt; directly if the patch
is not ready to be applied, but intended for discussion.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">See the next
section for how to configure and use git to send these
emails for you.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you want to
delete your temporary branch, you may do so with:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  % git checkout blead
  % git branch &minus;d orange
  error: The branch 'orange' is not an ancestor of your current HEAD.
  If you are sure you want to delete it, run 'git branch &minus;D orange'.
  % git branch &minus;D orange
  Deleted branch orange.</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Committing
your changes</b> <br>
Assuming that you&rsquo;d like to commit all the changes
you&rsquo;ve made as a single atomic unit, run this
command:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">   % git commit &minus;a</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">(That
<tt>&quot;&minus;a&quot;</tt> tells git to add every file
you&rsquo;ve changed to this commit. New files aren&rsquo;t
automatically added to your commit when you use
<tt>&quot;commit &minus;a&quot;</tt> If you want to add
files or to commit some, but not all of your changes, have a
look at the documentation for <tt>&quot;git
add&quot;</tt>.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Git will start
up your favorite text editor, so that you can craft a commit
message for your change. See &quot;Commit message&quot; in
perlhack for more information about what makes a good commit
message.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Once
you&rsquo;ve finished writing your commit message and exited
your editor, git will write your change to disk and tell you
something like this:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  Created commit daf8e63: explain git status and stuff about remotes
   1 files changed, 83 insertions(+), 3 deletions(&minus;)</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you re-run
<tt>&quot;git status&quot;</tt>, you should see something
like this:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  % git status
  # On branch blead
  # Your branch is ahead of 'origin/blead' by 2 commits.
  #
  # Untracked files:
  #   (use &quot;git add &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to include in what will be committed)
  #
  #       deliberate.untracked
  nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use &quot;git add&quot; to track)</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When in doubt,
before you do anything else, check your status and read it
carefully, many questions are answered directly by the git
status output.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Using git to
send patch emails</b> <br>
Please read perlhack first in order to figure out where your
patches should be sent.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In your
~/git/perl repository, set the destination email to
perl&rsquo;s bug tracker:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  $ git config sendemail.to perlbug@perl.org</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Or maybe
perl5&minus;porters:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  $ git config sendemail.to perl5&minus;porters@perl.org</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Then you can
use git directly to send your patch emails:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  $ git send&minus;email 0001&minus;Rename&minus;Leon&minus;Brocard&minus;to&minus;Orange&minus;Brocard.patch</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You may need to
set some configuration variables for your particular email
service provider. For example, to set your global git config
to send email via a gmail account:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  $ git config &minus;&minus;global sendemail.smtpserver smtp.gmail.com
  $ git config &minus;&minus;global sendemail.smtpssl 1
  $ git config &minus;&minus;global sendemail.smtpuser YOURUSERNAME@gmail.com</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">With this
configuration, you will be prompted for your gmail password
when you run &rsquo;git send&minus;email&rsquo;. You can
also configure <tt>&quot;sendemail.smtppass&quot;</tt> with
your password if you don&rsquo;t care about having your
password in the .gitconfig file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>A note on
derived files</b> <br>
Be aware that many files in the distribution are
derivative--avoid patching them, because git won&rsquo;t see
the changes to them, and the build process will overwrite
them. Patch the originals instead. Most utilities (like
perldoc) are in this category, i.e. patch
<i>utils/perldoc.PL</i> rather than <i>utils/perldoc</i>.
Similarly, don&rsquo;t create patches for files under
<tt>$src_root</tt>/ext from their copies found in
<tt>$install_root</tt>/lib. If you are unsure about the
proper location of a file that may have gotten copied while
building the source distribution, consult the
<tt>&quot;MANIFEST&quot;</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Cleaning a
working directory</b> <br>
The command <tt>&quot;git clean&quot;</tt> can with varying
arguments be used as a replacement for <tt>&quot;make
clean&quot;</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To reset your
working directory to a pristine condition you can do:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  % git clean &minus;dxf</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">However, be
aware this will delete <small>ALL</small> untracked content.
You can use</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  % git clean &minus;Xf</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">to remove all
ignored untracked files, such as build and test byproduct,
but leave any manually created files alone.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you only
want to cancel some uncommitted edits, you can use
<tt>&quot;git checkout&quot;</tt> and give it a list of
files to be reverted, or <tt>&quot;git checkout
&minus;f&quot;</tt> to revert them all.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you want to
cancel one or several commits, you can use <tt>&quot;git
reset&quot;</tt>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Bisecting</b>
<tt><br>
&quot;git&quot;</tt> provides a built-in way to determine
which commit should be blamed for introducing a given bug.
<tt>&quot;git bisect&quot;</tt> performs a binary search of
history to locate the first failing commit. It is fast,
powerful and flexible, but requires some setup and to
automate the process an auxiliary shell script is
needed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The core
provides a wrapper program, <i>Porting/bisect.pl</i>, which
attempts to simplify as much as possible, making bisecting
as simple as running a Perl one-liner. For example, if you
want to know when this became an error:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    perl &minus;e 'my $a := 2'</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">you simply run
this:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    .../Porting/bisect.pl &minus;e 'my $a := 2;'</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Using
<tt>&quot;bisect.pl&quot;</tt>, with one command (and no
other files) it&rsquo;s easy to find out</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">usually without
needing to know which versions of perl to use as start and
end revisions, as <i>bisect.pl</i> automatically searches to
find the earliest stable version for which the test case
passes. Run <tt>&quot;Porting/bisect.pl
&minus;&minus;help&quot;</tt> for the full documentation,
including how to set the <tt>&quot;Configure&quot;</tt> and
build time options.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you require
more flexibility than <i>Porting/bisect.pl</i> has to offer,
you&rsquo;ll need to run <tt>&quot;git bisect&quot;</tt>
yourself. It&rsquo;s most useful to use <tt>&quot;git bisect
run&quot;</tt> to automate the building and testing of perl
revisions. For this you&rsquo;ll need a shell script for
<tt>&quot;git&quot;</tt> to call to test a particular
revision. An example script is
<i>Porting/bisect&minus;example.sh</i>, which you should
copy <b>outside</b> of the repository, as the bisect process
will reset the state to a clean checkout as it runs. The
instructions below assume that you copied it as <i>~/run</i>
and then edited it as appropriate.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You first enter
in bisect mode with:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  % git bisect start</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For example, if
the bug is present on <tt>&quot;HEAD&quot;</tt> but
wasn&rsquo;t in 5.10.0, <tt>&quot;git&quot;</tt> will learn
about this when you enter:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  % git bisect bad
  % git bisect good perl&minus;5.10.0
  Bisecting: 853 revisions left to test after this</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This results in
checking out the median commit between
<tt>&quot;HEAD&quot;</tt> and
<tt>&quot;perl&minus;5.10.0&quot;</tt>. You can then run the
bisecting process with:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  % git bisect run ~/run</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When the first
bad commit is isolated, <tt>&quot;git bisect&quot;</tt> will
tell you so:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  ca4cfd28534303b82a216cfe83a1c80cbc3b9dc5 is first bad commit

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can peek
into the bisecting process with <tt>&quot;git bisect
log&quot;</tt> and <tt>&quot;git bisect
visualize&quot;</tt>. <tt>&quot;git bisect reset&quot;</tt>
will get you out of bisect mode.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Please note
that the first <tt>&quot;good&quot;</tt> state must be an
ancestor of the first <tt>&quot;bad&quot;</tt> state. If you
want to search for the commit that <i>solved</i> some bug,
you have to negate your test case (i.e. exit with <tt>1</tt>
if <small>OK</small> and <tt>0</tt> if not) and still mark
the lower bound as <tt>&quot;good&quot;</tt> and the upper
as <tt>&quot;bad&quot;</tt>. The &quot;first bad
commit&quot; has then to be understood as the &quot;first
commit where the bug is solved&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><tt>&quot;git
help bisect&quot;</tt> has much more information on how you
can tweak your binary searches.</p>

<h2>Topic branches and rewriting history
<a name="Topic branches and rewriting history"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Individual
committers should create topic branches under
<b>yourname</b>/<b>some_descriptive_name</b>. Other
committers should check with a topic branch&rsquo;s creator
before making any change to it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The simplest
way to create a remote topic branch that works on all
versions of git is to push the current head as a new branch
on the remote, then check it out locally:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  $ branch=&quot;$yourname/$some_descriptive_name&quot;
  $ git push origin HEAD:$branch
  $ git checkout &minus;b $branch origin/$branch</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Users of git
1.7 or newer can do it in a more obvious manner:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  $ branch=&quot;$yourname/$some_descriptive_name&quot;
  $ git checkout &minus;b $branch
  $ git push origin &minus;u $branch</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you are not
the creator of <b>yourname</b>/<b>some_descriptive_name</b>,
you might sometimes find that the original author has edited
the branch&rsquo;s history. There are lots of good reasons
for this. Sometimes, an author might simply be rebasing the
branch onto a newer source point. Sometimes, an author might
have found an error in an early commit which they wanted to
fix before merging the branch to blead.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Currently the
master repository is configured to forbid non-fast-forward
merges. This means that the branches within can not be
rebased and pushed as a single step.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The only way
you will ever be allowed to rebase or modify the history of
a pushed branch is to delete it and push it as a new branch
under the same name. Please think carefully about doing
this. It may be better to sequentially rename your branches
so that it is easier for others working with you to
cherry-pick their local changes onto the new version. (
<small>XXX:</small> needs explanation).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you want to
rebase a personal topic branch, you will have to delete your
existing topic branch and push as a new version of it. You
can do this via the following formula (see the explanation
about <tt>&quot;refspec&quot;</tt>&rsquo;s in the git push
documentation for details) after you have rebased your
branch:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">   # first rebase
   $ git checkout $user/$topic
   $ git fetch
   $ git rebase origin/blead
   # then &quot;delete&minus;and&minus;push&quot;
   $ git push origin :$user/$topic
   $ git push origin $user/$topic</pre>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b><small>NOTE:</small></b>
it is forbidden at the repository level to delete any of the
&quot;primary&quot; branches. That is any branch matching
<tt>&quot;m!^(blead|maint|perl)!&quot;</tt>. Any attempt to
do so will result in git producing an error like this:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    $ git push origin :blead
    *** It is forbidden to delete blead/maint branches in this repository
    error: hooks/update exited with error code 1
    error: hook declined to update refs/heads/blead
    To ssh://perl5.git.perl.org/perl
     ! [remote rejected] blead (hook declined)
     error: failed to push some refs to 'ssh://perl5.git.perl.org/perl'</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As a matter of
policy we do <b>not</b> edit the history of the blead and
maint&minus;* branches. If a typo (or worse) sneaks into a
commit to blead or maint&minus;*, we&rsquo;ll fix it in
another commit. The only types of updates allowed on these
branches are &quot;fast-forward&rsquo;s&quot;, where all
history is preserved.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Annotated tags
in the canonical perl.git repository will never be deleted
or modified. Think long and hard about whether you want to
push a local tag to perl.git before doing so. (Pushing
unannotated tags is not allowed.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Grafts</b>
<br>
The perl history contains one mistake which was not caught
in the conversion: a merge was recorded in the history
between blead and maint&minus;5.10 where no merge actually
occurred. Due to the nature of git, this is now impossible
to fix in the public repository. You can remove this
mis-merge locally by adding the following line to your
<tt>&quot;.git/info/grafts&quot;</tt> file:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  296f12bbbbaa06de9be9d09d3dcf8f4528898a49 434946e0cb7a32589ed92d18008aaa1d88515930</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is
particularly important to have this graft line if any
bisecting is done in the area of the &quot;merge&quot; in
question.</p>

<h2>WRITE ACCESS TO THE GIT REPOSITORY
<a name="WRITE ACCESS TO THE GIT REPOSITORY"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Once you have
write access, you will need to modify the <small>URL</small>
for the origin remote to enable pushing. Edit
<i>.git/config</i> with the <i>git&minus;config</i>(1)
command:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  % git config remote.origin.url ssh://perl5.git.perl.org/perl.git</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can also
set up your user name and e&minus;mail address. Most people
do this once globally in their <i>~/.gitconfig</i> by doing
something like:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  % git config &minus;&minus;global user.name &quot;var Arnfjoer` Bjarmason&quot;
  % git config &minus;&minus;global user.email avarab@gmail.com</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">However if
you&rsquo;d like to override that just for perl then execute
then execute something like the following in
<i>perl</i>:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  % git config user.email avar@cpan.org</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is also
possible to keep <tt>&quot;origin&quot;</tt> as a git
remote, and add a new remote for ssh access:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  % git remote add camel perl5.git.perl.org:/perl.git</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This allows you
to update your local repository by pulling from
<tt>&quot;origin&quot;</tt>, which is faster and
doesn&rsquo;t require you to authenticate, and to push your
changes back with the <tt>&quot;camel&quot;</tt> remote:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  % git fetch camel
  % git push camel</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<tt>&quot;fetch&quot;</tt> command just updates the
<tt>&quot;camel&quot;</tt> refs, as the objects themselves
should have been fetched when pulling from
<tt>&quot;origin&quot;</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Committing
to blead</b> <br>
The &rsquo;blead&rsquo; branch will become the next
production release of Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Before pushing
<i>any</i> local change to blead, it&rsquo;s incredibly
important that you do a few things, lest other committers
come after you with pitchforks and torches:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&bull;</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">Make sure you have a good commit
message. See &quot;Commit message&quot; in perlhack for
details.</p> </td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>&bull;</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>Run the test suite. You might not think that one typo
fix would break a test file. You&rsquo;d be wrong.
Here&rsquo;s an example of where not running the suite
caused problems. A patch was submitted that added a couple
of tests to an existing .t. It couldn&rsquo;t possibly
affect anything else, so no need to test beyond the single
affected .t, right? But, the submitter&rsquo;s email address
had changed since the last of their submissions, and this
caused other tests to fail. Running the test target given in
the next item would have caught this problem.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>&bull;</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>If you don&rsquo;t run the full test suite, at least
<tt>&quot;make test_porting&quot;</tt>. This will run basic
sanity checks. To see which sanity checks, have a look in
<i>t/porting</i>.</p> </td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>&bull;</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>If you make any changes that affect miniperl or core
routines that have different code paths for miniperl, be
sure to run <tt>&quot;make minitest&quot;</tt>. This will
catch problems that even the full test suite will not catch
because it runs a subset of tests under miniperl rather than
perl.</p> </td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>On merging
and rebasing</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Simple, one-off
commits pushed to the &rsquo;blead&rsquo; branch should be
simple commits that apply cleanly. In other words, you
should make sure your work is committed against the current
position of blead, so that you can push back to the master
repository without merging.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Sometimes,
blead will move while you&rsquo;re building or testing your
changes. When this happens, your push will be rejected with
a message like this:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  To ssh://perl5.git.perl.org/perl.git
   ! [rejected]        blead &minus;&gt; blead (non&minus;fast&minus;forward)
  error: failed to push some refs to 'ssh://perl5.git.perl.org/perl.git'
  To prevent you from losing history, non&minus;fast&minus;forward updates were rejected
  Merge the remote changes (e.g. 'git pull') before pushing again.  See the
  'Note about fast&minus;forwards' section of 'git push &minus;&minus;help' for details.</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When this
happens, you can just <i>rebase</i> your work against the
new position of blead, like this (assuming your remote for
the master repository is &quot;p5p&quot;):</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  $ git fetch p5p
  $ git rebase p5p/blead</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You will see
your commits being re-applied, and you will then be able to
push safely. More information about rebasing can be found in
the documentation for the <i>git&minus;rebase</i>(1)
command.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For larger sets
of commits that only make sense together, or that would
benefit from a summary of the set&rsquo;s purpose, you
should use a merge commit. You should perform your work on a
topic branch, which you should regularly rebase against
blead to ensure that your code is not broken by blead
moving. When you have finished your work, please perform a
final rebase and test. Linear history is something that gets
lost with every commit on blead, but a final rebase makes
the history linear again, making it easier for future
maintainers to see what has happened. Rebase as follows
(assuming your work was on the branch
<tt>&quot;committer/somework&quot;</tt>):</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  $ git checkout committer/somework
  $ git rebase blead</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Then you can
merge it into master like this:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  $ git checkout blead
  $ git merge &minus;&minus;no&minus;ff &minus;&minus;no&minus;commit committer/somework
  $ git commit &minus;a</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The switches
above deserve explanation.
<tt>&quot;&minus;&minus;no&minus;ff&quot;</tt> indicates
that even if all your work can be applied linearly against
blead, a merge commit should still be prepared. This ensures
that all your work will be shown as a side branch, with all
its commits merged into the mainstream blead by the merge
commit.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><tt>&quot;&minus;&minus;no&minus;commit&quot;</tt>
means that the merge commit will be <i>prepared</i> but not
<i>committed</i>. The commit is then actually performed when
you run the next command, which will bring up your editor to
describe the commit. Without
<tt>&quot;&minus;&minus;no&minus;commit&quot;</tt>, the
commit would be made with nearly no useful message, which
would greatly diminish the value of the merge commit as a
placeholder for the work&rsquo;s description.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When describing
the merge commit, explain the purpose of the branch, and
keep in mind that this description will probably be used by
the eventual release engineer when reviewing the next
perldelta document.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Committing
to maintenance versions</b> <br>
Maintenance versions should only be altered to add critical
bug fixes, see perlpolicy.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To commit to a
maintenance version of perl, you need to create a local
tracking branch:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  % git checkout &minus;&minus;track &minus;b maint&minus;5.005 origin/maint&minus;5.005</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This creates a
local branch named <tt>&quot;maint&minus;5.005&quot;</tt>,
which tracks the remote branch
<tt>&quot;origin/maint&minus;5.005&quot;</tt>. Then you can
pull, commit, merge and push as before.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can also
cherry-pick commits from blead and another branch, by using
the <tt>&quot;git cherry&minus;pick&quot;</tt> command. It
is recommended to use the <b>&minus;x</b> option to
<tt>&quot;git cherry&minus;pick&quot;</tt> in order to
record the <small>SHA1</small> of the original commit in the
new commit message.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Before pushing
any change to a maint version, make sure you&rsquo;ve
satisfied the steps in &quot;Committing to blead&quot;
above.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Merging from
a branch via GitHub</b> <br>
While we don&rsquo;t encourage the submission of patches via
GitHub, that will still happen. Here is a guide to merging
patches from a GitHub repository.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  % git remote add avar git://github.com/avar/perl.git
  % git fetch avar</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Now you can see
the differences between the branch and blead:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  % git diff avar/orange</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">And you can see
the commits:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  % git log avar/orange</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you approve
of a specific commit, you can cherry pick it:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  % git cherry&minus;pick 0c24b290ae02b2ab3304f51d5e11e85eb3659eae</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Or you could
just merge the whole branch if you like it all:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  % git merge avar/orange</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">And then push
back to the repository:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  % git push</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>A note on
