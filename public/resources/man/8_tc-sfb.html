<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Stochastic Fair
Blue is a classless qdisc to manage congestion based on
packet loss and link utilization history while trying to
prevent non-responsive flows (i.e. flows that do not react
to congestion marking or dropped packets) from impacting
performance of responsive flows. Unlike RED, where the
marking probability has to be configured, BLUE tries to
determine the ideal marking probability automatically.</p>

<h2>ALGORITHM
<a name="ALGORITHM"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The <b>BLUE</b>
algorithm maintains a probability which is used to mark or
drop packets that are to be queued. If the queue overflows,
the mark/drop probability is increased. If the queue becomes
empty, the probability is decreased. The <b>Stochastic Fair
Blue</b> (SFB) algorithm is designed to protect TCP flows
against non-responsive flows.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This SFB
implementation maintains 8 levels of 16 bins each for
accounting. Each flow is mapped into a bin of each level
using a per-level hash value.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Every bin
maintains a marking probability, which gets increased or
decreased based on bin occupancy. If the number of packets
exceeds the size of that bin, the marking probability is
increased. If the number drops to zero, it is decreased.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The marking
probability is based on the minimum value of all bins a flow
is mapped into, thus, when a flow does not respond to
marking or gradual packet drops, the marking probability
quickly reaches one.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In this case,
the flow is rate-limited to <b>penalty_rate</b> packets per
second.</p>

<h2>LIMITATIONS
<a name="LIMITATIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Due to SFBs
nature, it is possible for responsive flows to share all of
its bins with a non-responsive flow, causing the responsive
flow to be misidentified as being non-responsive.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The probability
of a responsive flow to be misidentified is dependent on the
number of non-responsive flows, M. It is (1 - (1 - (1 /
16.0)) ** M) **8, so for example with 10 non-responsive
flows approximately 0.2% of responsive flows will be
misidentified.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To mitigate
this, SFB performs performs periodic re-hashing to avoid
misclassification for prolonged periods of time.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The default
hashing method will use source and destination ip addresses
and port numbers if possible, and also supports tunneling
protocols. Alternatively, an external classifier can be
configured, too.</p>

<p>Double buffering warmup wait time, in milliseconds. To
avoid destroying the probability history when rehashing is
performed, this implementation maintains a second set of
levels/bins as described in section 4.4 of the SFB
reference. While one set is used to manage the queue, a
second set is warmed up: Whenever a flow is then determined
to be non-responsive, the marking probabilities in the
second set are updated. When the rehashing happens, these
bins will be used to manage the queue and all non-responsive
flows can be rate-limited immediately. This value determines
how much time has to pass before the 2nd set will start to
be warmed up. Defaults to one minute, should be lower than
<b>rehash.</b></p> </td></tr>

</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">increment</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">A value used to increase the
marking probability when the queue appears to be over-used.
Must be between 0 and 1.0. Defaults to 0.00050.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">decrement</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Value used to decrease the
marking probability when the queue is found to be empty.
Must be between 0 and 1.0. Defaults to 0.00005.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">penalty_rate</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The maximum number of packets
belonging to flows identified as being non-responsive that
can be enqueued per second. Once this number has been
reached, further packets of such non-responsive flows are
dropped. Set this to a reasonable fraction of your uplink
throughput; the default value of 10 packets is probably too
small.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">penalty_burst</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The number of packets a flow is
permitted to exceed the penalty rate before packets start
being dropped. Defaults to 20 packets.</p>

<h2>STATISTICS
<a name="STATISTICS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This qdisc
exposes additional statistics via &rsquo;tc -s qdisc&rsquo;
output. These are: <br>
earlydrop</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The number of packets dropped
before a per-flow queue was full.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">ratedrop</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The number of packets dropped
because of rate-limiting. If this value is high, there are
many non-reactive flows being sent through sfb. In such
cases, it might be better to embed sfb within a classful
qdisc to better control such flows using a different,
shaping qdisc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">bucketdrop</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The number of packets dropped
because a per-flow queue was full. High bucketdrop may point
to a high number of aggressive, short-lived flows.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">queuedrop</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The number of packets dropped
due to reaching limit. This should normally be 0.</p>

</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">maxqlen</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The length of the current
longest per-flow (virtual) queue.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">maxprob</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The maximum per-flow drop
probability. 1 means that some flows have been detected as
non-reactive.</p>

<h2>NOTES
<a name="NOTES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">SFB
automatically enables use of Explicit Congestion
Notification (ECN). Also, this SFB implementation does not
queue packets itself. Rather, packets are enqueued to the
inner qdisc (defaults to pfifo). Because sfb maintains
virtual queue states, the inner qdisc must not drop a packet
previously queued. Furthermore, if a buckets queue has a
very high marking rate, this implementation will start
dropping packets instead of marking them, as such a
situation points to either bad congestion, or an
unresponsive flow.</p>
