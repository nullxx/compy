<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">git-rm &minus;
Remove files from the working tree and from the index</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>git rm</i>
[&minus;f | &minus;&minus;force] [&minus;n] [&minus;r]
[&minus;&minus;cached] [&minus;&minus;ignore&minus;unmatch]
[&minus;&minus;quiet] [&minus;&minus;] &lt;file&gt;...</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Remove files
from the index, or from the working tree and the index. git
rm will not remove a file from just your working directory.
(There is no option to remove a file only from the working
tree and yet keep it in the index; use /bin/rm if you want
to do that.) The files being removed have to be identical to
the tip of the branch, and no updates to their contents can
be staged in the index, though that default behavior can be
overridden with the &minus;f option. When
&minus;&minus;cached is given, the staged content has to
match either the tip of the branch or the file on disk,
allowing the file to be removed from just the index.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&lt;file&gt;...</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Files to remove. Fileglobs
(e.g. *.c) can be given to remove all matching files. If you
want Git to expand file glob characters, you may need to
shell&minus;escape them. A leading directory name (e.g. dir
to remove dir/file1 and dir/file2) can be given to remove
all files in the directory, and recursively all
sub&minus;directories, but this requires the &minus;r option
to be explicitly given.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;f,
&minus;&minus;force</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Override the
up&minus;to&minus;date check.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;n,
&minus;&minus;dry&minus;run</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Don&rsquo;t actually remove any
file(s). Instead, just show if they exist in the index and
would otherwise be removed by the command.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;r</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Allow recursive removal when a
leading directory name is given.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This option can be used to
separate command&minus;line options from the list of files,
(useful when filenames might be mistaken for
command&minus;line options).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;cached</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Use this option to unstage and
remove paths only from the index. Working tree files,
whether modified or not, will be left alone.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;ignore&minus;unmatch</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Exit with a zero status even if
no files matched.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;q,
&minus;&minus;quiet</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">git rm normally outputs one
line (in the form of an rm command) for each file removed.
This option suppresses that output.</p>

<h2>DISCUSSION
<a name="DISCUSSION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
&lt;file&gt; list given to the command can be exact
pathnames, file glob patterns, or leading directory names.
The command removes only the paths that are known to Git.
Giving the name of a file that you have not told Git about
does not remove that file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">File globbing
matches across directory boundaries. Thus, given two
directories d and d2, there is a difference between using
git rm 'd*' and git rm 'd/*', as the former will also remove
all of directory d2.</p>

<h2>REMOVING FILES THAT HAVE DISAPPEARED FROM THE FILESYSTEM
<a name="REMOVING FILES THAT HAVE DISAPPEARED FROM THE FILESYSTEM"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There is no
option for git rm to remove from the index only the paths
that have disappeared from the filesystem. However,
depending on the use case, there are several ways that can
be done.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Using
&ldquo;git commit &minus;a&rdquo;</b> <br>
If you intend that your next commit should record all
modifications of tracked files in the working tree and
record all removals of files that have been removed from the
working tree with rm (as opposed to git rm), use git commit
&minus;a, as it will automatically notice and record all
removals. You can also have a similar effect without
committing by using git add &minus;u.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Using
&ldquo;git add &minus;A&rdquo;</b> <br>
When accepting a new code drop for a vendor branch, you
probably want to record both the removal of paths and
additions of new paths as well as modifications of existing
paths.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Typically you
would first remove all tracked files from the working tree
using this command:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">git
ls&minus;files &minus;z | xargs &minus;0 rm &minus;f</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">and then untar
the new code in the working tree. Alternately you could
<i>rsync</i> the changes into the working tree.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">After that, the
easiest way to record all removals, additions, and
modifications in the working tree is:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">git add
&minus;A</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">See
<b>git-add</b>(1).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Other
ways</b> <br>
If all you really want to do is to remove from the index the
files that are no longer present in the working tree
(perhaps because your working tree is dirty so that you
cannot use git commit &minus;a), use the following
command:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">git diff
&minus;&minus;name&minus;only
&minus;&minus;diff&minus;filter=D &minus;z | xargs &minus;0
git rm &minus;&minus;cached</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Submodules</b>
<br>
Only submodules using a gitfile (which means they were
cloned with a Git version 1.7.8 or newer) will be removed
from the work tree, as their repository lives inside the
.git directory of the superproject. If a submodule (or one
of those nested inside it) still uses a .git directory, git
rm will fail &minus; no matter if forced or not &minus; to
protect the submodule&rsquo;s history.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A submodule is
considered up&minus;to&minus;date when the HEAD is the same
as recorded in the index, no tracked files are modified and
no untracked files that aren&rsquo;t ignored are present in
the submodules work tree. Ignored files are deemed
expendable and won&rsquo;t stop a submodule&rsquo;s work
tree from being removed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you only
want to remove the local checkout of a submodule from your
work tree without committing the removal, use
<b>git-submodule</b>(1) deinit instead.</p>

<h2>EXAMPLES
<a name="EXAMPLES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">git rm
Documentation/\*.txt</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Removes all *.txt files from
the index that are under the Documentation directory and any
of its subdirectories.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that the
asterisk * is quoted from the shell in this example; this
lets Git, and not the shell, expand the pathnames of files
and subdirectories under the Documentation/ directory.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">git rm &minus;f
git&minus;*.sh</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Because this example lets the
shell expand the asterisk (i.e. you are listing the files
explicitly), it does not remove subdir/git&minus;foo.sh.</p>
