<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">perlfork
&minus; Perl&rsquo;s fork() emulation</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>


<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    NOTE:  As of the 5.8.0 release, fork() emulation has considerably
    matured.  However, there are still a few known bugs and differences
    from real fork() that might affect you.  See the &quot;BUGS&quot; and
    &quot;CAVEATS AND LIMITATIONS&quot; sections below.</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Perl provides a
<i>fork()</i> keyword that corresponds to the Unix system
call of the same name. On most Unix-like platforms where the
<i>fork()</i> system call is available, Perl&rsquo;s
<i>fork()</i> simply calls it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On some
platforms such as Windows where the <i>fork()</i> system
call is not available, Perl can be built to emulate
<i>fork()</i> at the interpreter level. While the emulation
is designed to be as compatible as possible with the real
<i>fork()</i> at the level of the Perl program, there are
certain important differences that stem from the fact that
all the pseudo child &quot;processes&quot; created this way
live in the same real process as far as the operating system
is concerned.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This document
provides a general overview of the capabilities and
limitations of the <i>fork()</i> emulation. Note that the
issues discussed here are not applicable to platforms where
a real <i>fork()</i> is available and Perl has been
configured to use it.</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>fork()</i> emulation is implemented at the level of the
Perl interpreter. What this means in general is that running
<i>fork()</i> will actually clone the running interpreter
and all its state, and run the cloned interpreter in a
separate thread, beginning execution in the new thread just
after the point where the <i>fork()</i> was called in the
parent. We will refer to the thread that implements this
child &quot;process&quot; as the pseudo-process.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To the Perl
program that called <i>fork()</i>, all this is designed to
be transparent. The parent returns from the <i>fork()</i>
with a pseudo-process <small>ID</small> that can be
subsequently used in any process-manipulation functions; the
child returns from the <i>fork()</i> with a value of
<tt>0</tt> to signify that it is the child
pseudo-process.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Behavior of
other Perl features in forked pseudo-processes</b> <br>
Most Perl features behave in a natural way within
pseudo-processes. <br>
$$ or $PROCESS_ID</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">This special variable is
correctly set to the pseudo-process <small>ID</small> . It
can be used to identify pseudo-processes within a particular
session. Note that this value is subject to recycling if any
pseudo-processes are launched after others have been
<i>wait()</i>&minus;ed on.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"

<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="6%">


<p>%ENV</p></td>
<td width="6%"></td>
<td width="77%">


<p>Each pseudo-process maintains its own virtual
environment. Modifications to <tt>%ENV</tt> affect the
virtual environment, and are only visible within that
pseudo-process, and in any processes (or pseudo-processes)
launched from it.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>chdir()</i> and all other
builtins that accept filenames</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">Each pseudo-process maintains
its own virtual idea of the current directory. Modifications
to the current directory using <i>chdir()</i> are only
visible within that pseudo-process, and in any processes (or
pseudo-processes) launched from it. All file and directory
accesses from the pseudo-process will correctly map the
virtual working directory to the real working directory
appropriately.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>wait()</i> and
<i>waitpid()</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;"><i>wait()</i> and
<i>waitpid()</i> can be passed a pseudo-process
<small>ID</small> returned by <i>fork()</i>. These calls
will properly wait for the termination of the pseudo-process
and return its status.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="9%">


<p><i>kill()</i></p></td>
<td width="3%"></td>
<td width="77%">


<p><tt>&quot;kill('KILL', ...)&quot;</tt> can be used to
terminate a pseudo-process by passing it the
<small>ID</small> returned by <i>fork()</i>. The outcome of
kill on a pseudo-process is unpredictable and it should not
be used except under dire circumstances, because the
operating system may not guarantee integrity of the process
resources when a running thread is terminated. The process
which implements the pseudo-processes can be blocked and the
Perl interpreter hangs. Note that using
<tt>&quot;kill('KILL', ...)&quot;</tt> on a
pseudo&minus;<i>process()</i> may typically cause memory
leaks, because the thread that implements the pseudo-process
does not get a chance to clean up its resources.</p></td></tr>
</table>


<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em"><tt>&quot;kill('TERM',
...)&quot;</tt> can also be used on pseudo-processes, but
the signal will not be delivered while the pseudo-process is
blocked by a system call, e.g. waiting for a socket to
connect, or trying to read from a socket with no data
available. Starting in Perl 5.14 the parent process will not
wait for children to exit once they have been signalled with
<tt>&quot;kill('TERM', ...)&quot;</tt> to avoid deadlock
during process exit. You will have to explicitly call
<i>waitpid()</i> to make sure the child has time to clean-up
itself, but you are then also responsible that the child is
not blocking on I/O either.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"

<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="9%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em"><i>exec()</i></p></td>
<td width="3%"></td>
<td width="77%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">Calling <i>exec()</i> within a
pseudo-process actually spawns the requested executable in a
separate process and waits for it to complete before exiting
with the same exit status as that process. This means that
the process <small>ID</small> reported within the running
executable will be different from what the earlier Perl
<i>fork()</i> might have returned. Similarly, any process
manipulation functions applied to the <small>ID</small>
returned by <i>fork()</i> will affect the waiting
pseudo-process that called <i>exec()</i>, not the real
process it is waiting for after the <i>exec()</i>.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">When
<i>exec()</i> is called inside a pseudo-process then
<small>DESTROY</small> methods and <small>END</small> blocks
will still be called after the external process returns.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><i>exit()</i></p></td>
<td width="3%"></td>
<td width="77%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em"><i>exit()</i> always exits just
the executing pseudo-process, after automatically
<i>wait()</i>&minus;ing for any outstanding child
pseudo-processes. Note that this means that the process as a
whole will not exit unless all running pseudo-processes have
exited. See below for some limitations with open
filehandles.</p> </td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Open handles to files,
directories and network sockets</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">All open handles are
<i>dup()</i>&minus;ed in pseudo-processes, so that closing
any handles in one process does not affect the others. See
below for some limitations.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Resource
limits</b> <br>
In the eyes of the operating system, pseudo-processes
created via the <i>fork()</i> emulation are simply threads
in the same process. This means that any process-level
limits imposed by the operating system apply to all
pseudo-processes taken together. This includes any limits
imposed by the operating system on the number of open file,
directory and socket handles, limits on disk space usage,
limits on memory size, limits on <small>CPU</small>
utilization etc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Killing the
parent process</b> <br>
If the parent process is killed (either using Perl&rsquo;s
<i>kill()</i> builtin, or using some external means) all the
pseudo-processes are killed as well, and the whole process
exits.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Lifetime of
the parent process and pseudo-processes</b> <br>
During the normal course of events, the parent process and
every pseudo-process started by it will wait for their
respective pseudo-children to complete before they exit.
This means that the parent and every pseudo-child created by
it that is also a pseudo-parent will only exit after their
pseudo-children have exited.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Starting with
Perl 5.14 a parent will not <i>wait()</i> automatically for
any child that has been signalled with <tt>&quot;sig('TERM',
...)&quot;</tt> to avoid a deadlock in case the child is
blocking on I/O and never receives the signal.</p>

<h2>CAVEATS AND LIMITATIONS
<a name="CAVEATS AND LIMITATIONS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><small>BEGIN</small>
blocks</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">The <i>fork()</i> emulation
will not work entirely correctly when called from within a
<small>BEGIN</small> block. The forked copy will run the
contents of the <small>BEGIN</small> block, but will not
continue parsing the source stream after the
<small>BEGIN</small> block. For example, consider the
following code:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">    BEGIN {
        fork and exit;          # fork child and exit the parent
        print &quot;inner\n&quot;;
    }
    print &quot;outer\n&quot;;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">This will
print:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">    inner</pre>


<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">rather than the
expected:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">    inner
    outer</pre>


<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">This limitation
arises from fundamental technical difficulties in cloning
and restarting the stacks used by the Perl parser in the
middle of a parse.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Open filehandles</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">Any filehandles open at the
time of the <i>fork()</i> will be <i>dup()</i>&minus;ed.
Thus, the files can be closed independently in the parent
and child, but beware that the <i>dup()</i>&minus;ed handles
will still share the same seek pointer. Changing the seek
position in the parent will change it in the child and
vice-versa. One can avoid this by opening files that need
distinct seek pointers separately in the child.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">On some
operating systems, notably Solaris and Unixware, calling
<tt>&quot;exit()&quot;</tt> from a child process will flush
and close open filehandles in the parent, thereby corrupting
the filehandles. On these systems, calling
<tt>&quot;_exit()&quot;</tt> is suggested instead.
<tt>&quot;_exit()&quot;</tt> is available in Perl through
the <tt>&quot;POSIX&quot;</tt> module. Please consult your
system&rsquo;s manpages for more information on this.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Open directory handles</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">Perl will completely read from
all open directory handles until they reach the end of the
stream. It will then <i>seekdir()</i> back to the original
location and all future <i>readdir()</i> requests will be
fulfilled from the cache buffer. That means that neither the
directory handle held by the parent process nor the one held
by the child process will see any changes made to the
directory after the <i>fork()</i> call.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
<i>rewinddir()</i> has a similar limitation on Windows and
will not force <i>readdir()</i> to read the directory again
either. Only a newly opened directory handle will reflect
changes to the directory.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Forking pipe <i>open()</i> not
yet implemented</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">The <tt>&quot;open(FOO,
&quot;|&minus;&quot;)&quot;</tt> and <tt>&quot;open(BAR,
&quot;&minus;|&quot;)&quot;</tt> constructs are not yet
implemented. This limitation can be easily worked around in
new code by creating a pipe explicitly. The following
example shows how to write to a forked child:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">    # simulate open(FOO, &quot;|&minus;&quot;)
    sub pipe_to_fork ($) {
        my $parent = shift;
        pipe my $child, $parent or die;
        my $pid = fork();
        die &quot;fork() failed: $!&quot; unless defined $pid;
        if ($pid) {
            close $child;
        }
        else {
            close $parent;
            open(STDIN, &quot;&lt;&amp;=&quot; . fileno($child)) or die;
        }
        $pid;
    }
    if (pipe_to_fork('FOO')) {
        # parent
        print FOO &quot;pipe_to_fork\n&quot;;
        close FOO;
    }
    else {
        # child
        while (&lt;STDIN&gt;) { print; }
        exit(0);
    }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">And this one
reads from the child:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">    # simulate open(FOO, &quot;&minus;|&quot;)
    sub pipe_from_fork ($) {
        my $parent = shift;
        pipe $parent, my $child or die;
        my $pid = fork();
        die &quot;fork() failed: $!&quot; unless defined $pid;
        if ($pid) {
            close $child;
        }
        else {
            close $parent;
            open(STDOUT, &quot;&gt;&amp;=&quot; . fileno($child)) or die;
        }
        $pid;
    }
    if (pipe_from_fork('BAR')) {
        # parent
        while (&lt;BAR&gt;) { print; }
        close BAR;
    }
    else {
        # child
        print &quot;pipe_from_fork\n&quot;;
        exit(0);
    }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">Forking pipe
<i>open()</i> constructs will be supported in future.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Global state maintained by
XSUBs</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">External subroutines (XSUBs)
that maintain their own global state may not work correctly.
Such XSUBs will either need to maintain locks to protect
simultaneous access to global data from different
pseudo-processes, or maintain all their state on the Perl
symbol table, which is copied naturally when <i>fork()</i>
is called. A callback mechanism that provides extensions an
opportunity to clone their state will be provided in the
near future.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Interpreter embedded in larger
application</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">The <i>fork()</i> emulation may
not behave as expected when it is executed in an application
which embeds a Perl interpreter and calls Perl APIs that can
evaluate bits of Perl code. This stems from the fact that
the emulation only has knowledge about the Perl
interpreter&rsquo;s own data structures and knows nothing
about the containing application&rsquo;s state. For example,
any state carried on the application&rsquo;s own call stack
is out of reach.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Thread-safety of extensions</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">Since the <i>fork()</i>
emulation runs code in multiple threads, extensions calling
into non-thread-safe libraries may not work reliably when
calling <i>fork()</i>. As Perl&rsquo;s threading support
gradually becomes more widely adopted even on platforms with
a native <i>fork()</i>, such extensions are expected to be
fixed for thread-safety.</p>

<h2>PORTABILITY CAVEATS

</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In portable
Perl code, <tt>&quot;kill(9, $child)&quot;</tt> must not be
used on forked processes. Killing a forked process is unsafe
and has unpredictable results. See
&quot;<i>kill()</i>&quot;, above.</p>
