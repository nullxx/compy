<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Reads list of
objects from the standard input, and writes a packed archive
with specified base&minus;name, or to the standard
output.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A packed
archive is an efficient way to transfer a set of objects
between two repositories as well as an access efficient
archival format. In a packed archive, an object is either
stored as a compressed whole or as a difference from some
other object. The latter is often called a delta.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The packed
archive format (.pack) is designed to be
self&minus;contained so that it can be unpacked without any
further information. Therefore, each object that a delta
depends upon must be present within the pack.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A pack index
file (.idx) is generated for fast, random access to the
objects in the pack. Placing both the index file (.idx) and
the packed archive (.pack) in the pack/ subdirectory of
$GIT_OBJECT_DIRECTORY (or any of the directories on
$GIT_ALTERNATE_OBJECT_DIRECTORIES) enables Git to read from
the pack archive.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The <i>git
unpack&minus;objects</i> command can read the packed archive
and expand the objects contained in the pack into
&quot;one&minus;file one&minus;object&quot; format; this is
typically done by the smart&minus;pull commands when a pack
is created on&minus;the&minus;fly for efficient network
transport by their peers.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">base&minus;name</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Write into a pair of files
(.pack and .idx), using &lt;base&minus;name&gt; to determine
the name of the created file. When this option is used, the
two files are written in
&lt;base&minus;name&gt;&minus;&lt;SHA&minus;1&gt;.{pack,idx}
files. &lt;SHA&minus;1&gt; is a hash of the sorted object
names to make the resulting filename based on the pack
content, and written to the standard output of the
command.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;stdout</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Write the pack contents (what
would have been written to .pack file) out to the standard
output.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;revs</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Read the revision arguments
from the standard input, instead of individual object names.
The revision arguments are processed the same way as <i>git
rev&minus;list</i> with the &minus;&minus;objects flag uses
its commit arguments to build the list of objects it
outputs. The objects on the resulting list are packed.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;unpacked</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This implies
&minus;&minus;revs. When processing the list of revision
arguments read from the standard input, limit the objects
packed to those that are not already packed.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;all</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This implies
&minus;&minus;revs. In addition to the list of revision
arguments read from the standard input, pretend as if all
refs under refs/ are specified to be included.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;include&minus;tag</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Include unasked&minus;for
annotated tags if the object they reference was included in
the resulting packfile. This can be useful to send new tags
to native Git clients.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;window=&lt;n&gt;,
&minus;&minus;depth=&lt;n&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">These two options affect how
the objects contained in the pack are stored using delta
compression. The objects are first internally sorted by
type, size and optionally names and compared against the
other objects within &minus;&minus;window to see if using
delta compression saves space. &minus;&minus;depth limits
the maximum delta depth; making it too deep affects the
performance on the unpacker side, because delta data needs
to be applied that many times to get to the necessary
object. The default value for &minus;&minus;window is 10 and
&minus;&minus;depth is 50.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;window&minus;memory=&lt;n&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This option provides an
additional limit on top of &minus;&minus;window; the window
size will dynamically scale down so as to not take up more
than <i>&lt;n&gt;</i> bytes in memory. This is useful in
repositories with a mix of large and small objects to not
run out of memory with a large window, but still be able to
take advantage of the large window for the smaller objects.
The size can be suffixed with &quot;k&quot;, &quot;m&quot;,
or &quot;g&quot;. &minus;&minus;window&minus;memory=0 makes
memory usage unlimited, which is the default.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;max&minus;pack&minus;size=&lt;n&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Maximum size of each output
pack file. The size can be suffixed with &quot;k&quot;,
&quot;m&quot;, or &quot;g&quot;. The minimum size allowed is
limited to 1 MiB. If specified, multiple packfiles may be
created. The default is unlimited, unless the config
variable pack.packSizeLimit is set.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;honor&minus;pack&minus;keep</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This flag causes an object
already in a local pack that has a .keep file to be ignored,
even if it would have otherwise been packed.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;incremental</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This flag causes an object
already in a pack to be ignored even if it would have
otherwise been packed.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;local</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This flag causes an object that
is borrowed from an alternate object store to be ignored
even if it would have otherwise been packed.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;non&minus;empty</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Only create a packed archive if
it would contain at least one object.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;progress</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Progress status is reported on
the standard error stream by default when it is attached to
a terminal, unless &minus;q is specified. This flag forces
progress status even if the standard error stream is not
directed to a terminal.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;all&minus;progress</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When &minus;&minus;stdout is
specified then progress report is displayed during the
object count and compression phases but inhibited during the
write&minus;out phase. The reason is that in some cases the
output stream is directly linked to another command which
may wish to display progress status of its own as it
processes incoming pack data. This flag is like
&minus;&minus;progress except that it forces progress report
for the write&minus;out phase as well even if
&minus;&minus;stdout is used.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;all&minus;progress&minus;implied</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This is used to imply
&minus;&minus;all&minus;progress whenever progress display
is activated. Unlike &minus;&minus;all&minus;progress this
flag doesn&rsquo;t actually force any progress display by
itself.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;q</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This flag makes the command not
to report its progress on the standard error stream.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;no&minus;reuse&minus;delta</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When creating a packed archive
in a repository that has existing packs, the command reuses
existing deltas. This sometimes results in a slightly
suboptimal pack. This flag tells the command not to reuse
existing deltas but compute them from scratch.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;no&minus;reuse&minus;object</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This flag tells the command not
to reuse existing object data at all, including non
deltified object, forcing recompression of everything. This
implies &minus;&minus;no&minus;reuse&minus;delta. Useful
only in the obscure case where wholesale enforcement of a
different compression level on the packed data is
desired.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;compression=&lt;n&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Specifies compression level for
newly&minus;compressed data in the generated pack. If not
specified, pack compression level is determined first by
pack.compression, then by core.compression, and defaults to
&minus;1, the zlib default, if neither is set. Add
&minus;&minus;no&minus;reuse&minus;object if you want to
force a uniform compression level on all data no matter the
source.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;thin</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Create a &quot;thin&quot; pack
by omitting the common objects between a sender and a
receiver in order to reduce network transfer. This option
only makes sense in conjunction with
&minus;&minus;stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note: A thin
pack violates the packed archive format by omitting required
objects and is thus unusable by Git without making it
self&minus;contained. Use git index&minus;pack
&minus;&minus;fix&minus;thin (see <b>git-index-pack</b>(1))
to restore the self&minus;contained property.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;delta&minus;base&minus;offset</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A packed archive can express
the base object of a delta as either a 20&minus;byte object
name or as an offset in the stream, but ancient versions of
Git don&rsquo;t understand the latter. By default, <i>git
pack&minus;objects</i> only uses the former format for
better compatibility. This option allows the command to use
the latter format for compactness. Depending on the average
delta chain length, this option typically shrinks the
resulting packfile by 3&minus;5 per&minus;cent.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note: Porcelain
commands such as git gc (see <b>git-gc</b>(1)), git repack
(see <b>git-repack</b>(1)) pass this option by default in
modern Git when they put objects in your repository into
pack files. So does git bundle (see <b>git-bundle</b>(1))
when it creates a bundle.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;threads=&lt;n&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Specifies the number of threads
to spawn when searching for best delta matches. This
requires that pack&minus;objects be compiled with pthreads
otherwise this option is ignored with a warning. This is
meant to reduce packing time on multiprocessor machines. The
required amount of memory for the delta search window is
however multiplied by the number of threads. Specifying 0
will cause Git to auto&minus;detect the number of
CPU&rsquo;s and set the number of threads accordingly.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;index&minus;version=&lt;version&gt;[,&lt;offset&gt;]</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This is intended to be used by
the test suite only. It allows to force the version for the
generated pack index, and to force 64&minus;bit index
entries on objects located above the given offset.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;keep&minus;true&minus;parents</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">With this option, parents that
are hidden by grafts are packed nevertheless.</p>
