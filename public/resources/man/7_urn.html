<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A Uniform
Resource Identifier (URI) is a short string of characters
identifying an abstract or physical resource (for example, a
web page). A Uniform Resource Locator (URL) is a URI that
identifies a resource through its primary access mechanism
(e.g., its network &quot;location&quot;), rather than by
name or some other attribute of that resource. A Uniform
Resource Name (URN) is a URI that must remain globally
unique and persistent even when the resource ceases to exist
or becomes unavailable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">URIs are the
standard way to name hypertext link destinations for tools
such as web browsers. The string
&quot;http://www.kernelnotes.org&quot; is a URL (and thus it
is also a URI). Many people use the term URL loosely as a
synonym for URI (though technically URLs are a subset of
URIs).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">URIs can be
absolute or relative. An absolute identifier refers to a
resource independent of context, while a relative identifier
refers to a resource by describing the difference from the
current context. Within a relative path reference, the
complete path segments &quot;.&quot; and &quot;..&quot; have
special meanings: &quot;the current hierarchy level&quot;
and &quot;the level above this hierarchy level&quot;,
respectively, just like they do in UNIX-like systems. A path
segment which contains a colon character can&rsquo;t be used
as the first segment of a relative URI path (e.g.,
&quot;this:that&quot;), because it would be mistaken for a
scheme name; precede such segments with ./ (e.g.,
&quot;./this:that&quot;). Note that descendants of MS-DOS
(e.g., Microsoft Windows) replace devicename colons with the
vertical bar (&quot;|&quot;) in URIs, so &quot;C:&quot;
becomes &quot;C|&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A fragment
identifier, if included, refers to a particular named
portion (fragment) of a resource; text after a '#'
identifies the fragment. A URI beginning with '#' refers to
that fragment in the current resource.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Usage</b>
<br>
There are many different URI schemes, each with specific
additional rules and meanings, but they are intentionally
made to be as similar as possible. For example, many URL
schemes permit the authority to be the following format,
called here an <i>ip_server</i> (square brackets show
what&rsquo;s optional):</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em"><i>ip_server =</i> [<i>user</i>
[ : <i>password</i> ] @ ] <i>host</i> [ : <i>port</i>]</p></td>
<td width="11%">
</td></tr>
</table>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">


<p>This format allows you to optionally insert a username,
a user plus password, and/or a port number. The
<i>host</i></p> <td width="11%"></td>
<td width="89%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">is the name of the host
computer, either its name as determined by DNS or an IP
address (numbers separated by periods). Thus the URI
&lt;http://fred:fredpassword@xyz.com:8080/&gt; logs into a
web server on host xyz.com as fred (using fredpassword)
using port 8080. Avoid including a password in a URI if
possible because of the many security risks of having a
password written down. If the URL supplies a username but no
password, and the remote server requests a password, the
program interpreting the URL should request one from the
user.</p> </td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Here are some
of the most common schemes in use on UNIX-like systems that
are understood by many tools. Note that many tools using
URIs also have internal schemes or specialized schemes; see
those tools&rsquo; documentation for information on those
schemes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>http &minus;
Web (HTTP) server</b></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">http://<i>ip_server</i>/<i>path</i>
<br>
http://<i>ip_server</i>/<i>path</i>?<i>query</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This is a URL
accessing a web (HTTP) server. The default port is 80. If
the path refers to a directory, the web server will choose
what to return; usually if there is a file named
&quot;index.html&quot; or &quot;index.htm&quot; its content
is returned, otherwise, a list of the files in the current
directory (with appropriate links) is generated and
returned. An example is &lt;http://lwn.net&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A query can be
given in the archaic &quot;isindex&quot; format, consisting
of a word or phrase and not including an equal sign (=). A
query can also be in the longer &quot;GET&quot; format,
which has one or more query entries of the form
<i>key</i>=<i>value</i> separated by the ampersand character
(&amp;). Note that <i>key</i> can be repeated more than
once, though it&rsquo;s up to the web server and its
application programs to determine if there&rsquo;s any
meaning to that. There is an unfortunate interaction with
HTML/XML/SGML and the GET query format; when such URIs with
more than one key are embedded in SGML/XML documents
(including HTML), the ampersand (&amp;) has to be rewritten
as &amp;amp;. Note that not all queries use this format;
larger forms may be too long to store as a URI, so they use
a different interaction mechanism (called POST) which does
not include the data in the URI. See the Common Gateway
Interface specification at
<a href="http://www.w3.org/CGI">http://www.w3.org/CGI</a>
for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>ftp &minus;
File Transfer Protocol (FTP)</b></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">ftp://<i>ip_server</i>/<i>path</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This is a URL
accessing a file through the file transfer protocol (FTP).
The default port (for control) is 21. If no username is
included, the username &quot;anonymous&quot; is supplied,
and in that case many clients provide as the password the
requestor&rsquo;s Internet email address. An example is
&lt;ftp://ftp.is.co.za/rfc/rfc1808.txt&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>gopher
&minus; Gopher server</b></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">gopher://<i>ip_server</i>/<i>gophertype
selector</i> <br>
gopher://<i>ip_server</i>/<i>gophertype
selector</i>%09<i>search</i> <br>
gopher://<i>ip_server</i>/<i>gophertype
selector</i>%09<i>search</i>%09<i>gopher+_string</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The default
gopher port is 70. <i>gophertype</i> is a single-character
field to denote the Gopher type of the resource to which the
URL refers. The entire path may also be empty, in which case
the delimiting &quot;/&quot; is also optional and the
gophertype defaults to &quot;1&quot;.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>selector</i>
is the Gopher selector string. In the Gopher protocol,
Gopher selector strings are a sequence of octets which may
contain any octets except 09 hexadecimal (US-ASCII HT or
tab), 0A hexadecimal (US-ASCII character LF), and 0D
(US-ASCII character CR).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>mailto
&minus; Email address</b></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">mailto:<i>email-address</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This is an
email address, usually of the form
<i>name</i>@<i>hostname</i>. See <b>mailaddr</b>(7) for more
information on the correct format of an email address. Note
that any % character must be rewritten as %25. An example is
&lt;mailto:dwheeler@dwheeler.com&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>news &minus;
Newsgroup or News message</b></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">news:<i>newsgroup-name</i>
<br>
news:<i>message-id</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A
<i>newsgroup-name</i> is a period-delimited hierarchical
name, such as &quot;comp.infosystems.www.misc&quot;. If
&lt;newsgroup-name&gt; is &quot;*&quot; (as in
&lt;news:*&gt;), it is used to refer to &quot;all available
news groups&quot;. An example is
&lt;news:comp.lang.ada&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A
<i>message-id</i> corresponds to the Message-ID of
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1036.txt">IETF
RFC&nbsp;1036,</a> without the enclosing &quot;&lt;&quot;
and &quot;&gt;&quot;; it takes the form
<i>unique</i>@<i>full_domain_name</i>. A message identifier
may be distinguished from a news group name by the presence
of the &quot;@&quot; character.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>telnet
&minus; Telnet login</b></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">telnet://<i>ip_server</i>/</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The Telnet URL
scheme is used to designate interactive text services that
may be accessed by the Telnet protocol. The final
&quot;/&quot; character may be omitted. The default port is
23. An example is &lt;telnet://melvyl.ucop.edu/&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>file &minus;
Normal file</b></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">file://<i>ip_server</i>/<i>path_segments</i>
<br>
file:<i>path_segments</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This represents
a file or directory accessible locally. As a special case,
<i>ip_server</i> can be the string &quot;localhost&quot; or
the empty string; this is interpreted as &quot;the machine
from which the URL is being interpreted&quot;. If the path
is to a directory, the viewer should display the
directory&rsquo;s contents with links to each containee; not
all viewers currently do this. KDE supports generated files
through the URL &lt;file:/cgi-bin&gt;. If the given file
isn&rsquo;t found, browser writers may want to try to expand
the filename via filename globbing (see <b>glob</b>(7) and
<b>glob</b>(3)).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The second
format (e.g., &lt;file:/etc/passwd&gt;) is a correct format
for referring to a local file. However, older standards did
not permit this format, and some programs don&rsquo;t
recognize this as a URI. A more portable syntax is to use an
empty string as the server name, for example,
&lt;file:///etc/passwd&gt;; this form does the same thing
and is easily recognized by pattern matchers and older
programs as a URI. Note that if you really mean to say
&quot;start from the current location,&quot; don&rsquo;t
specify the scheme at all; use a relative address like
&lt;../test.txt&gt;, which has the side-effect of being
scheme-independent. An example of this scheme is
&lt;file:///etc/passwd&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>man &minus;
Man page documentation</b></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">man:<i>command-name</i>
<br>
man:<i>command-name</i>(<i>section</i>)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This refers to
local online manual (man) reference pages. The command name
can optionally be followed by a parenthesis and section
number; see <b>man</b>(7) for more information on the
meaning of the section numbers. This URI scheme is unique to
UNIX-like systems (such as Linux) and is not currently
registered by the IETF. An example is &lt;man:ls(1)&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>info &minus;
Info page documentation</b></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">info:<i>virtual-filename</i>
<br>
info:<i>virtual-filename</i>#<i>nodename</i> <br>
info:(<i>virtual-filename</i>) <br>
info:(<i>virtual-filename</i>)<i>nodename</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This scheme
refers to online info reference pages (generated from
texinfo files), a documentation format used by programs such
as the GNU tools. This URI scheme is unique to UNIX-like
systems (such as Linux) and is not currently registered by
the IETF. As of this writing, GNOME and KDE differ in their
URI syntax and do not accept the other&rsquo;s syntax. The
first two formats are the GNOME format; in nodenames all
spaces are written as underscores. The second two formats
are the KDE format; spaces in nodenames must be written as
spaces, even though this is forbidden by the URI standards.
It&rsquo;s hoped that in the future most tools will
understand all of these formats and will always accept
underscores for spaces in nodenames. In both GNOME and KDE,
if the form without the nodename is used the nodename is
assumed to be &quot;Top&quot;. Examples of the GNOME format
are &lt;info:gcc&gt; and &lt;info:gcc#G++_and_GCC&gt;.
Examples of the KDE format are &lt;info:(gcc)&gt; and
&lt;info:(gcc)G++ and GCC&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>whatis
&minus; Documentation search</b></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">whatis:<i>string</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This scheme
searches the database of short (one-line) descriptions of
commands and returns a list of descriptions containing that
string. Only complete word matches are returned. See
<b>whatis</b>(1). This URI scheme is unique to UNIX-like
systems (such as Linux) and is not currently registered by
the IETF.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>ghelp

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>other
schemes</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There are many
other URI schemes. Most tools that accept URIs support a set
of internal URIs (e.g., Mozilla has the about: scheme for
internal information, and the GNOME help browser has the
toc: scheme for various starting locations). There are many
schemes that have been defined but are not as widely used at
the current time (e.g., prospero). The nntp: scheme is
deprecated in favor of the news: scheme. URNs are to be
supported by the urn: scheme, with a hierarchical name space
(e.g., urn:ietf:... would identify IETF documents); at this
time URNs are not widely implemented. Not all tools support
all schemes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Character
encoding</b> <br>
URIs use a limited number of characters so that they can be
typed in and used in a variety of situations.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
characters are reserved, that is, they may appear in a URI
but their use is limited to their reserved purpose
(conflicting data must be escaped before forming the
URI):</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">; / ? : @ &amp;
= + $ ,</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Unreserved
characters may be included in a URI. Unreserved characters
include upper and lower case English letters, decimal
digits, and the following limited set of punctuation marks
and symbols:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">&minus; _ . ! ~
* &rsquo; ( )</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">All other
characters must be escaped. An escaped octet is encoded as a
character triplet, consisting of the percent character
&quot;%&quot; followed by the two hexadecimal digits
representing the octet code (you can use upper or lower case
letters for the hexadecimal digits). For example, a blank
space must be escaped as &quot;%20&quot;, a tab character as
&quot;%09&quot;, and the &quot;&amp;&quot; as
&quot;%26&quot;. Because the percent &quot;%&quot; character
always has the reserved purpose of being the escape
indicator, it must be escaped as &quot;%25&quot;. It is
common practice to escape space characters as the plus
symbol (+) in query text; this practice isn&rsquo;t
uniformly defined in the relevant RFCs (which recommend %20
instead) but any tool accepting URIs with query text should
be prepared for them. A URI is always shown in its
&quot;escaped&quot; form.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Unreserved
characters can be escaped without changing the semantics of
the URI, but this should not be done unless the URI is being
used in a context that does not allow the unescaped
character to appear. For example, &quot;%7e&quot; is
sometimes used instead of &quot;~&quot; in an HTTP URL path,
but the two are equivalent for an HTTP URL.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For URIs which
must handle characters outside the US ASCII character set,
the HTML 4.01 specification (section B.2) and IETF
RFC&nbsp;2718 (section 2.2.5) recommend the following
approach:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">1.</p></td>
<td width="3%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">translate the character
sequences into UTF-8 (IETF RFC&nbsp;2279)&mdash;see
<b>utf-8</b>(7)&mdash;and then</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p>2.</p></td>
<td width="3%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>use the URI escaping mechanism, that is, use the %HH
encoding for unsafe octets.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Writing a
URI</b> <br>
When written, URIs should be placed inside double quotes
(e.g., &quot;http://www.kernelnotes.org&quot;), enclosed in
angle brackets (e.g., &lt;http://lwn.net&gt;), or placed on
a line by themselves. A warning for those who use
double-quotes: <b>never</b> move extraneous punctuation
(such as the period ending a sentence or the comma in a
list) inside a URI, since this will change the value of the
URI. Instead, use angle brackets instead, or switch to a
quoting system that never includes extraneous characters
inside quotation marks. This latter system, called the
&rsquo;new&rsquo; or &rsquo;logical&rsquo; quoting system by
&quot;Hart&rsquo;s Rules&quot; and the &quot;Oxford
Dictionary for Writers and Editors&quot;, is preferred
practice in Great Britain and hackers worldwide (see the
Jargon File&rsquo;s section on Hacker Writing Style,
<a href="http://www.fwi.uva.nl/~mes/jargon/h/HackerWritingStyle.html">http://www.fwi.uva.nl/~mes/jargon/h/HackerWritingStyle.html</a>,
for more information). Older documents suggested inserting
the prefix &quot;URL:&quot; just before the URI, but this
form has never caught on.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The URI syntax
was designed to be unambiguous. However, as URIs have become
commonplace, traditional media (television, radio,
newspapers, billboards, etc.) have increasingly used
abbreviated URI references consisting of only the authority
and path portions of the identified resource (e.g.,
&lt;www.w3.org/Addressing&gt;). Such references are
primarily intended for human interpretation rather than
machine, with the assumption that context-based heuristics
are sufficient to complete the URI (e.g., hostnames
beginning with &quot;www&quot; are likely to have a URI
prefix of &quot;http://&quot; and hostnames beginning with
&quot;ftp&quot; likely to have a prefix of
&quot;ftp://&quot;). Many client implementations
heuristically resolve these references. Such heuristics may
change over time, particularly when new schemes are
introduced. Since an abbreviated URI has the same syntax as
a relative URL path, abbreviated URI references cannot be
used where relative URIs are permitted, and can be used only
when there is no defined base (such as in dialog boxes).
Don&rsquo;t use abbreviated URIs as hypertext links inside a
document; use the standard format as described here.</p>

<h2>NOTES
<a name="NOTES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Any tool
accepting URIs (e.g., a web browser) on a Linux system
should be able to handle (directly or indirectly) all of the
schemes described here, including the man: and info:
schemes. Handling them by invoking some other program is
fine and in fact encouraged.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Technically the
fragment isn&rsquo;t part of the URI.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For information
on how to embed URIs (including URLs) in a data format, see
documentation on that format. HTML uses the format &lt;A
HREF=&quot;<i>uri</i>&quot;&gt; <i>text</i> &lt;/A&gt;.
Texinfo files use the format @uref{<i>uri</i>}. Man and mdoc
have the recently added UR macro, or just include the URI in
the text (viewers should be able to detect :// as part of a
URI).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The GNOME and
KDE desktop environments currently vary in the URIs they
accept, in particular in their respective help browsers. To
list man pages, GNOME uses &lt;toc:man&gt; while KDE uses
&lt;man:(index)&gt;, and to list info pages, GNOME uses
&lt;toc:info&gt; while KDE uses &lt;info:(dir)&gt; (the
author of this man page prefers the KDE approach here,
though a more regular format would be even better). In
general, KDE uses &lt;file:/cgi-bin/&gt; as a prefix to a
set of generated files. KDE prefers documentation in HTML,
accessed via the &lt;file:/cgi-bin/helpindex&gt;. GNOME
prefers the ghelp scheme to store and find documentation.
Neither browser handles file: references to directories at
the time of this writing, making it difficult to refer to an
entire directory with a browsable URI. As noted above, these
environments differ in how they handle the info: scheme,
probably the most important variation. It is expected that
GNOME and KDE will converge to common URI formats, and a
future version of this man page will describe the converged
result. Efforts to aid this convergence are encouraged.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Security</b>
<br>
A URI does not in itself pose a security threat. There is no
general guarantee that a URL, which at one time located a
given resource, will continue to do so. Nor is there any
guarantee that a URL will not locate a different resource at
some later point in time; such a guarantee can be obtained
only from the person(s) controlling that namespace and the
resource in question.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is sometimes
possible to construct a URL such that an attempt to perform
a seemingly harmless operation, such as the retrieval of an
entity associated with the resource, will in fact cause a
possibly damaging remote operation to occur. The unsafe URL
is typically constructed by specifying a port number other
than that reserved for the network protocol in question. The
client unwittingly contacts a site that is in fact running a
different protocol. The content of the URL contains
instructions that, when interpreted according to this other
protocol, cause an unexpected operation. An example has been
the use of a gopher URL to cause an unintended or
impersonating message to be sent via a SMTP server.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Caution should
be used when using any URL that specifies a port number
other than the default for the protocol, especially when it
is a number within the reserved space.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Care should be
taken when a URI contains escaped delimiters for a given
protocol (for example, CR and LF characters for telnet
protocols) that these are not unescaped before transmission.
This might violate the protocol, but avoids the potential
for such characters to be used to simulate an extra
operation or parameter in that protocol, which might lead to
an unexpected and possibly harmful remote operation to be
performed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is clearly
unwise to use a URI that contains a password which is
intended to be secret. In particular, the use of a password
within the &quot;userinfo&quot; component of a URI is
strongly recommended against except in those rare cases
where the &quot;password&quot; parameter is intended to be
public.</p>

<h2>BUGS
<a name="BUGS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Documentation
may be placed in a variety of locations, so there currently
isn&rsquo;t a good URI scheme for general online
documentation in arbitrary formats. References of the form
&lt;file:///usr/doc/ZZZ&gt; don&rsquo;t work because
different distributions and local installation requirements
may place the files in different directories (it may be in
/usr/doc, or /usr/local/doc, or /usr/share, or somewhere
else). Also, the directory ZZZ usually changes when a
version changes (though filename globbing could partially
overcome this). Finally, using the file: scheme
doesn&rsquo;t easily support people who dynamically load
documentation from the Internet (instead of loading the
files onto a local file system). A future URI scheme may be
added (e.g., &quot;userdoc:&quot;) to permit programs to
include cross-references to more detailed documentation
without having to know the exact location of that
documentation. Alternatively, a future version of the
file-system specification may specify file locations
sufficiently so that the file: scheme will be able to locate
documentation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Many programs
and file formats don&rsquo;t include a way to incorporate or
implement links using URIs.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Many programs
can&rsquo;t handle all of these different URI formats; there
should be a standard mechanism to load an arbitrary URI that
automatically detects the users&rsquo; environment (e.g.,
text or graphics, desktop environment, local user
preferences, and currently executing tools) and invokes the
right tool for any URI.</p>
