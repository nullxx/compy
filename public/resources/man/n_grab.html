<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This command
implements simple pointer and keyboard grabs for Tk.
Tk&rsquo;s grabs are different than the grabs described in
the Xlib documentation. When a grab is set for a particular
window, Tk restricts all pointer events to the grab window
and its descendants in Tk&rsquo;s window hierarchy. Whenever
the pointer is within the grab window&rsquo;s subtree, the
pointer will behave exactly the same as if there had been no
grab at all and all events will be reported in the normal
fashion. When the pointer is outside <i>window</i>&rsquo;s
tree, button presses and releases and mouse motion events
are reported to <i>window</i>, and window entry and window
exit events are ignored. The grab subtree &ldquo;owns&rdquo;
the pointer: windows outside the grab subtree will be
visible on the screen but they will be insensitive until the
grab is released. The tree of windows underneath the grab
window can include top-level windows, in which case all of
those top-level windows and their descendants will continue
to receive mouse events during the grab.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Two forms of
grabs are possible: local and global. A local grab affects
only the grabbing application: events will be reported to
other applications as if the grab had never occurred. Grabs
are local by default. A global grab locks out all
applications on the screen, so that only the given subtree
of the grabbing application will be sensitive to pointer
events (mouse button presses, mouse button releases, pointer
motions, window entries, and window exits). During global
grabs the window manager will not receive pointer events
either.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">During local
grabs, keyboard events (key presses and key releases) are
delivered as usual: the window manager controls which
application receives keyboard events, and if they are sent
to any window in the grabbing application then they are
redirected to the focus window. During a global grab Tk
grabs the keyboard so that all keyboard events are always
sent to the grabbing application. The <b>focus</b> command
is still used to determine which window in the application
receives the keyboard events. The keyboard grab is released
when the grab is released.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Grabs apply to
particular displays. If an application has windows on
multiple displays then it can establish a separate grab on
each display. The grab on a particular display affects only
the windows on that display. It is possible for different
applications on a single display to have simultaneous local
grabs, but only one application can have a global grab on a
given display at once.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The <b>grab</b>
command can take any of the following forms: <b><br>
grab</b> ?<b>&minus;global</b>? <i>window</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Same as <b>grab set</b>,
described below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>grab current</b>
?<i>window</i>?</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If <i>window</i> is specified,
returns the name of the current grab window in this
application for <i>window</i>&rsquo;s display, or an empty
string if there is no such window. If <i>window</i> is
omitted, the command returns a list whose elements are all
of the windows grabbed by this application for all displays,
or an empty string if the application has no grabs.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>grab release</b>
<i>window</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Releases the grab on
<i>window</i> if there is one, otherwise does nothing.
Returns an empty string.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>grab set</b>
?<b>&minus;global</b>? <i>window</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Sets a grab on <i>window</i>.
If <b>&minus;global</b> is specified then the grab is
global, otherwise it is local. If a grab was already in
effect for this application on <i>window</i>&rsquo;s display
then it is automatically released. If there is already a
grab on <i>window</i> and it has the same global/local form
as the requested grab, then the command does nothing.
Returns an empty string.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>grab status</b>
<i>window</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Returns <b>none</b> if no grab
is currently set on <i>window</i>, <b>local</b> if a local
grab is set on <i>window</i>, and <b>global</b> if a global
grab is set.</p>

<h2>WARNING
<a name="WARNING"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is very easy
to use global grabs to render a display completely unusable
(e.g. by setting a grab on a widget which does not respond
to events and not providing any mechanism for releasing the
grab). Take <i>extreme</i> care when using them!</p>

<h2>BUGS
<a name="BUGS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It took an
incredibly complex and gross implementation to produce the
simple grab effect described above. Given the current
implementation, it is not safe for applications to use the
Xlib grab facilities at all except through the Tk grab
procedures. If applications try to manipulate X&rsquo;s grab
mechanisms directly, things will probably break.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If a single
process is managing several different Tk applications, only
one of those applications can have a local grab for a given
display at any given time. If the applications are in
different processes, this restriction does not exist.</p>

<h2>EXAMPLE
<a name="EXAMPLE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Set a grab so
that only one button may be clicked out of a group. The
other buttons are unresponsive to the mouse until the middle
button is clicked.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">pack [button .b1 &minus;text
&quot;Click me! #1&quot; &minus;command {destroy .b1}] <br>
pack [button .b2 &minus;text &quot;Click me! #2&quot;
&minus;command {destroy .b2}] <br>
pack [button .b3 &minus;text &quot;Click me! #3&quot;
&minus;command {destroy .b3}] <b><br>
grab</b> .b2</p>
