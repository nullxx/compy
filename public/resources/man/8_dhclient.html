<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The Internet
Systems Consortium DHCP Client, <b>dhclient</b>, provides a
means for configuring one or more network interfaces using
the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol, BOOTP protocol, or
if these protocols fail, by statically assigning an
address.</p>

<h2>OPERATION
<a name="OPERATION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The DHCP
protocol allows a host to contact a central server which
maintains a list of IP addresses which may be assigned on
one or more subnets. A DHCP client may request an address
from this pool, and then use it on a temporary basis for
communication on network. The DHCP protocol also provides a
mechanism whereby a client can learn important details about
the network to which it is attached, such as the location of
a default router, the location of a name server, and so
on.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There are two
versions of the DHCP protocol DHCPv4 and DHCPv6. At startup
the client may be started for one or the other via the
<b>-4</b> or <b>-6</b> options.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On startup,
<b>dhclient</b> reads the dhclient.conf for configuration
instructions. It then gets a list of all the network
interfaces that are configured in the current system. For
each interface, it attempts to configure the interface using
the DHCP protocol.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In order to
keep track of leases across system reboots and server
restarts, <b>dhclient</b> keeps a list of leases it has been
assigned in the dhclient.leases file. On startup, after
reading the dhclient.conf file, <b>dhclient</b> reads the
dhclient.leases file to refresh its memory about what leases
it has been assigned.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When a new
lease is acquired, it is appended to the end of the
dhclient.leases file. In order to prevent the file from
becoming arbitrarily large, from time to time
<b>dhclient</b> creates a new dhclient.leases file from its
in-core lease database. The old version of the
dhclient.leases file is retained under the name
<i>dhclient.leases~</i> until the next time <b>dhclient</b>
rewrites the database.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Old leases are
kept around in case the DHCP server is unavailable when
<b>dhclient</b> is first invoked (generally during the
initial system boot process). In that event, old leases from
the dhclient.leases file which have not yet expired are
tested, and if they are determined to be valid, they are
used until either they expire or the DHCP server becomes
available.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A mobile host
which may sometimes need to access a network on which no
DHCP server exists may be preloaded with a lease for a fixed
address on that network. When all attempts to contact a DHCP
server have failed, <b>dhclient</b> will try to validate the
static lease, and if it succeeds, will use that lease until
it is restarted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A mobile host
may also travel to some networks on which DHCP is not
available but BOOTP is. In that case, it may be advantageous
to arrange with the network administrator for an entry on
the BOOTP database, so that the host can boot quickly on
that network rather than cycling through the list of old
leases.</p>

<h2>COMMAND LINE
<a name="COMMAND LINE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The names of
the network interfaces that <b>dhclient</b> should attempt
to configure may be specified on the command line. If no
interface names are specified on the command line
<b>dhclient</b> will normally identify all network
interfaces, eliminating non-broadcast interfaces if
possible, and attempt to configure each interface.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is also
possible to specify interfaces by name in the dhclient.conf
file. If interfaces are specified in this way, then the
client will only configure interfaces that are either
specified in the configuration file or on the command line,
and will ignore all other interfaces.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The client
normally prints no output during its startup sequence. It
can be made to emit verbose messages displaying the startup
sequence events until it has acquired an address by
supplying the <b>-v</b> command line argument. In either
case, the client logs messages using the <b>syslog(3)</b>
facility.</p>

Normally the DHCP client will run in the foreground until is
has configured an interface at which time it will revert to
running in the background. This option is useful when
running the client under a debugger, or when running it out
of inittab on System V systems. This implies <b>-v</b>.</p></td></tr>

<p>Continue running even if no broadcast interfaces were

to identify any network interfaces to configure. On laptop
computers and other computers with hot-swappable I/O buses,
it is possible that a broadcast interface may be added after
system startup. This flag can be used to cause the client
not to exit when it doesn&rsquo;t find any such interfaces.
The <b>omshell(1)</b> program can then be used to notify the
client when a network interface has been added or removed,
so that the client can attempt to configure an IP address on

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Normally, if
<b>dhclient</b> was compiled with libcap-ng support,
<b>dhclient</b> drops most capabilities immediately upon
startup. While more secure, this greatly restricts the
additional actions that hooks in <b>dhclient-script (8)</b>
can take. (For example, any daemons that <b>dhclient-script
(8)</b> starts or restarts will inherit the restricted
capabilities as well, which may interfere with their correct
operation.) Thus, the <b>&minus;nc</b> option can be used to
prevent <b>dhclient</b> from dropping capabilities.</p>

the client&rsquo;s hostname prefix, to which the server will
append the ddns-domainname or domain-name options, if any,
to derive the fully qualified domain name of the client. The

option.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;F&nbsp;&lt;fqdn.fqdn&gt;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specify the fqdn.fqdn option to
send to the DHCP server. This option cannot be used with the

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The UDP port number on which
the DHCP client should listen and transmit. If unspecified,
<b>dhclient</b> uses the default port of 68. This is mostly
useful for debugging purposes. If a different port is
specified on which the client should listen and transmit,
the client will also use a different destination port - one
less than the specified port.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specify the server IP address
or fully qualified domain name to use as a destination for
DHCP protocol messages before <b>dhclient</b> has acquired
an IP address. Normally, <b>dhclient</b> transmits these
messages to 255.255.255.255 (the IP limited broadcast
address). Overriding this is mostly useful for debugging
purposes. This feature is not supported in DHCPv6
(<b>-6</b>) mode.</p>

<b>dhclient</b> creates an identifier based on the
link-layer address (DUID-LL) if it is running in stateless
mode (with <b>&minus;S</b>, not requesting an address), or
it creates an identifier based on the link-layer address
plus a timestamp (DUID-LLT) if it is running in stateful

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;lf&nbsp;</b><i>lease-file</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Path to the lease database
file. If unspecified, the default
<b>/var/lib/dhclient/dhclient.leases</b> is used. See
<b>dhclient.leases(5)</b> for a description of this
file.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;pf&nbsp;</b><i>pid-file</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Path to the process ID file. If
unspecified, the default <b>/var/run/dhclient.pid</b> is
used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;-no-pid</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Option to disable writing pid
files. By default the program will write a pid file. If the
program is invoked with this option it will not attempt to
kill any existing client processes even if invoked with
<b>-r</b> or <b>-x</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;sf&nbsp;</b><i>script-file</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Path to the network
configuration script invoked by <b>dhclient</b> when it gets
a lease. If unspecified, the default
<b>/usr/sbin/dhclient-script</b> is used. See
<b>dhclient-script(8)</b> for a description of this
file.</p>

<h2>CONFIGURATION
<a name="CONFIGURATION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The syntax of
the <b>dhclient.conf(5)</b> file is discussed
separately.</p>

<h2>OMAPI
<a name="OMAPI"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The DHCP client
provides some ability to control it while it is running,
without stopping it. This capability is provided using
OMAPI, an API for manipulating remote objects. OMAPI clients
connect to the client using TCP/IP, authenticate, and can
then examine the client&rsquo;s current status and make
changes to it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Rather than
implementing the underlying OMAPI protocol directly, user
programs should use the dhcpctl API or OMAPI itself. Dhcpctl
is a wrapper that handles some of the housekeeping chores
that OMAPI does not do automatically. Dhcpctl and OMAPI are
documented in <b>dhcpctl(3)</b> and <b>omapi(3)</b>. Most
things you&rsquo;d want to do with the client can be done
directly using the <b>omshell(1)</b> command, rather than
having to write a special program.</p>

<h2>THE CONTROL OBJECT
<a name="THE CONTROL OBJECT"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The control
object allows you to shut the client down, releasing all
leases that it holds and deleting any DNS records it may
have added. It also allows you to pause the client - this
unconfigures any interfaces the client is using. You can
then restart it, which causes it to reconfigure those
interfaces. You would normally pause the client prior to
going into hibernation or sleep on a laptop computer. You
would then resume it after the power comes back. This allows
PC cards to be shut down while the computer is hibernating
or sleeping, and then reinitialized to their previous state
once the computer comes out of hibernation or sleep.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The control
object has one attribute - the state attribute. To shut the
client down, set its state attribute to 2. It will
automatically do a DHCPRELEASE. To pause it, set its state
attribute to 3. To resume it, set its state attribute to
4.</p>

<h2>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
<a name="ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
environment variables may be defined to override the builtin
defaults for file locations. Note that use of the related

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This client was
substantially modified and enhanced by Elliot Poger for use
on Linux while he was working on the MosquitoNet project at
Stanford.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The current
version owes much to Elliot&rsquo;s Linux enhancements, but
was substantially reorganized and partially rewritten by Ted
Lemon so as to use the same networking framework that the
Internet Systems Consortium DHCP server uses. Much
system-specific configuration code was moved into a shell
script so that as support for more operating systems is
added, it will not be necessary to port and maintain
system-specific configuration code to these operating
systems - instead, the shell script can invoke the native
tools to accomplish the same purpose.</p>
