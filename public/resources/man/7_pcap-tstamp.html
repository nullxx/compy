&minus; packet time stamps in libpcap</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When capturing
traffic, each packet is given a time stamp representing, for
incoming packets, the arrival time of the packet and, for
outgoing packets, the transmission time of the packet. This
time is an approximation of the arrival or transmission
time. If it is supplied by the operating system running on
the host on which the capture is being done, there are
several reasons why it might not precisely represent the
arrival or transmission time:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">if the time
stamp is applied to the packet when the networking stack
receives the packet, the networking stack might not see the
packet until an interrupt is delivered for the packet or a
timer event causes the networking device driver to poll for
packets, and the time stamp might not be applied until the
packet has had some processing done by other code in the
networking stack, so there might be a significant delay
between the time when the last bit of the packet is received
by the capture device and when the networking stack
time-stamps the packet;</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">the timer used
to generate the time stamps might have low resolution, for
example, it might be a timer updated once per host operating
system timer tick, with the host operating system timer
ticking once every few milliseconds;</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">a
high-resolution timer might use a counter that runs at a
rate dependent on the processor clock speed, and that clock
speed might be adjusted upwards or downwards over time and
the timer might not be able to compensate for all those
adjustments;</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">the host
operating system&rsquo;s clock might be adjusted over time
to match a time standard to which the host is being
synchronized, which might be done by temporarily slowing
down or speeding up the clock or by making a single
adjustment;</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">different CPU
cores on a multi-core or multi-processor system might be
running at different speeds, or might not have time counters
all synchronized, so packets time-stamped by different cores
might not have consistent time stamps.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In addition,
packets time-stamped by different cores might be
time-stamped in one order and added to the queue of packets
for libpcap to read in another order, so time stamps might
not be monotonically increasing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Some capture
devices on some platforms can provide time stamps for
packets; those time stamps are usually high-resolution time
stamps, and are usually applied to the packet when the first
or last bit of the packet arrives, and are thus more
accurate than time stamps provided by the host operating
system. Those time stamps might not, however, be
synchronized with the host operating system&rsquo;s clock,
so that, for example, the time stamp of a packet might not
correspond to the time stamp of an event on the host
triggered by the arrival of that packet.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Depending on
the capture device and the software on the host, libpcap
might allow different types of time stamp to be used. The
<b>pcap_list_tstamp_types</b>(3PCAP) routine provides, for a
packet capture handle created by <b>pcap_create</b>(3PCAP)
but not yet activated by <b>pcap_activate</b>(3PCAP), a list
of time stamp types supported by the capture device for that
handle. The list might be empty, in which case no choice of
time stamp type is offered for that capture device. If the
list is not empty, the <b>pcap_set_tstamp_type</b>(3PCAP)
routine can be used after a <b>pcap_create()</b> call and
before a <b>pcap_activate()</b> call to specify the type of
time stamp to be used on the device. The time stamp types
are listed here; the first value is the #define to use in
code, the second value is the value returned by
<b>pcap_tstamp_type_val_to_name()</b> and accepted by
<b>pcap_tstamp_name_to_val()</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;"><b>PCAP_TSTAMP_HOST</b> -
<b>host</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:26%;">Time stamp provided by the host
on which the capture is being done. The precision of this
time stamp is unspecified; it might or might not be
synchronized with the host operating system&rsquo;s
clock.</p>


<p style="margin-left:18%;"><b>PCAP_TSTAMP_HOST_LOWPREC</b>
- <b>host_lowprec</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:26%;">Time stamp provided by the host
on which the capture is being done. This is a low-precision
time stamp, synchronized with the host operating
system&rsquo;s clock.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;"><b>PCAP_TSTAMP_HOST_HIPREC</b>
- <b>host_hiprec</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:26%;">Time stamp provided by the host
on which the capture is being done. This is a high-precision
time stamp; it might or might not be synchronized with the
host operating system&rsquo;s clock. It might be more
expensive to fetch than <b>PCAP_TSTAMP_HOST_LOWPREC</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;"><b>PCAP_TSTAMP_ADAPTER</b> -
<b>adapter</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:26%;">Time stamp provided by the
network adapter on which the capture is being done. This is
a high-precision time stamp, synchronized with the host
operating system&rsquo;s clock.</p>


<p style="margin-left:18%;"><b>PCAP_TSTAMP_ADAPTER_UNSYNCED</b>
- <b>adapter_unsynced</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:26%;">Time stamp provided by the
network adapter on which the capture is being done. This is
a high-precision time stamp; it is not synchronized with the
host operating system&rsquo;s clock.</p>
