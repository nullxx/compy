<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>posix_spawn</i>() and <i>posix_spawnp</i>() functions
shall create a new process (child process) from the
specified process image. The new process image shall be
constructed from a regular executable file called the new
process image file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When a C
program is executed as the result of this call, it shall be
entered as a C-language function call as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>int
main(int</b> <i>argc</i><b>, char
*</b><i>argv</i><b>[]);</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">where
<i>argc</i> is the argument count and <i>argv</i> is an
array of character pointers to the arguments themselves. In
addition, the following variable:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>extern char
**environ;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">shall be
initialized as a pointer to an array of character pointers
to the environment strings.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The argument
<i>argv</i> is an array of character pointers to
null-terminated strings. The last member of this array shall
be a null pointer and is not counted in <i>argc</i>. These
strings constitute the argument list available to the new
process image. The value in <i>argv</i>[0] should point to a
filename that is associated with the process image being
started by the <i>posix_spawn</i>() or <i>posix_spawnp</i>()
function.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The argument
<i>envp</i> is an array of character pointers to
null-terminated strings. These strings constitute the
environment for the new process image. The environment array
is terminated by a null pointer.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The number of
bytes available for the child process&rsquo; combined
argument and environment lists is {ARG_MAX}. The
implementation shall specify in the system documentation
(see the Base Definitions volume of
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001, Chapter 2, Conformance)
whether any list overhead, such as length words, null
terminators, pointers, or alignment bytes, is included in
this total.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The <i>path</i>
argument to <i>posix_spawn</i>() is a pathname that
identifies the new process image file to execute.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The <i>file</i>
parameter to <i>posix_spawnp</i>() shall be used to
construct a pathname that identifies the new process image
file. If the <i>file</i> parameter contains a slash
character, the <i>file</i> parameter shall be used as the
pathname for the new process image file. Otherwise, the path
prefix for this file shall be obtained by a search of the
directories passed as the environment variable <i>PATH</i>
(see the Base Definitions volume of
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001, Chapter 8, Environment
Variables). If this environment variable is not defined, the
results of the search are implementation-defined.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If
<i>file_actions</i> is a null pointer, then file descriptors
open in the calling process shall remain open in the child
process, except for those whose close-on- <i>exec</i> flag
FD_CLOEXEC is set (see <i>fcntl</i>()). For those file
descriptors that remain open, all attributes of the
corresponding open file descriptions, including file locks
(see <i>fcntl</i>()), shall remain unchanged.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If
<i>file_actions</i> is not NULL, then the file descriptors
open in the child process shall be those open in the calling
process as modified by the spawn file actions object pointed
to by <i>file_actions</i> and the FD_CLOEXEC flag of each
remaining open file descriptor after the spawn file actions
have been processed. The effective order of processing the
spawn file actions shall be:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>posix_spawnattr_t</b> spawn attributes object type is
defined in <i>&lt;spawn.h&gt;</i>. It shall contain at least
the attributes defined below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the
POSIX_SPAWN_SETPGROUP flag is set in the <i>spawn-flags</i>
attribute of the object referenced by <i>attrp</i>, and the
<i>spawn-pgroup</i> attribute of the same object is
non-zero, then the child&rsquo;s process group shall be as
specified in the <i>spawn-pgroup</i> attribute of the object
referenced by <i>attrp</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As a special
case, if the POSIX_SPAWN_SETPGROUP flag is set in the
<i>spawn-flags</i> attribute of the object referenced by
<i>attrp</i>, and the <i>spawn-pgroup</i> attribute of the
same object is set to zero, then the child shall be in a new
process group with a process group ID equal to its process
ID.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the
POSIX_SPAWN_SETPGROUP flag is not set in the
<i>spawn-flags</i> attribute of the object referenced by
<i>attrp</i>, the new child process shall inherit the
parent&rsquo;s process group.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the
POSIX_SPAWN_SETSCHEDPARAM flag is set in the
<i>spawn-flags</i> attribute of the object referenced by
<i>attrp</i>, but POSIX_SPAWN_SETSCHEDULER is not set, the
new process image shall initially have the scheduling policy
of the calling process with the scheduling parameters
specified in the <i>spawn-schedparam</i> attribute of the
object referenced by <i>attrp</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the
POSIX_SPAWN_SETSCHEDULER flag is set in the
<i>spawn-flags</i> attribute of the object referenced by
<i>attrp</i> (regardless of the setting of the
POSIX_SPAWN_SETSCHEDPARAM flag), the new process image shall
initially have the scheduling policy specified in the
<i>spawn-schedpolicy</i> attribute of the object referenced
by <i>attrp</i> and the scheduling parameters specified in
the <i>spawn-schedparam</i> attribute of the same
object.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
POSIX_SPAWN_RESETIDS flag in the <i>spawn-flags</i>
attribute of the object referenced by <i>attrp</i> governs
the effective user ID of the child process. If this flag is
not set, the child process shall inherit the parent
process&rsquo; effective user ID. If this flag is set, the
child process&rsquo; effective user ID shall be reset to the
parent&rsquo;s real user ID. In either case, if the
set-user-ID mode bit of the new process image file is set,
the effective user ID of the child process shall become that
file&rsquo;s owner ID before the new process image begins
execution.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
POSIX_SPAWN_RESETIDS flag in the <i>spawn-flags</i>
attribute of the object referenced by <i>attrp</i> also
governs the effective group ID of the child process. If this
flag is not set, the child process shall inherit the parent
process&rsquo; effective group ID. If this flag is set, the
child process&rsquo; effective group ID shall be reset to
the parent&rsquo;s real group ID. In either case, if the
set-group-ID mode bit of the new process image file is set,
the effective group ID of the child process shall become
that file&rsquo;s group ID before the new process image
begins execution.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the
POSIX_SPAWN_SETSIGMASK flag is set in the <i>spawn-flags</i>
attribute of the object referenced by <i>attrp</i>, the
child process shall initially have the signal mask specified
in the <i>spawn-sigmask</i> attribute of the object
referenced by <i>attrp</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the
POSIX_SPAWN_SETSIGDEF flag is set in the <i>spawn-flags</i>
attribute of the object referenced by <i>attrp</i>, the
signals specified in the <i>spawn-sigdefault</i> attribute
of the same object shall be set to their default actions in
the child process. Signals set to the default action in the
parent process shall be set to the default action in the
child process.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Signals set to
be caught by the calling process shall be set to the default
action in the child process.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Except for
SIGCHLD, signals set to be ignored by the calling process
image shall be set to be ignored by the child process,
unless otherwise specified by the POSIX_SPAWN_SETSIGDEF flag
being set in the <i>spawn-flags</i> attribute of the object
referenced by <i>attrp</i> and the signals being indicated
in the <i>spawn-sigdefault</i> attribute of the object
referenced by <i>attrp</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the SIGCHLD
signal is set to be ignored by the calling process, it is
unspecified whether the SIGCHLD signal is set to be ignored
or to the default action in the child process, unless
otherwise specified by the POSIX_SPAWN_SETSIGDEF flag being
set in the <i>spawn_flags</i> attribute of the object
referenced by <i>attrp</i> and the SIGCHLD signal being
indicated in the <i>spawn_sigdefault</i> attribute of the
object referenced by <i>attrp</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the value of
the <i>attrp</i> pointer is NULL, then the default values
are used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">All process
attributes, other than those influenced by the attributes
set in the object referenced by <i>attrp</i> as specified
above or by the file descriptor manipulations specified in
<i>file_actions</i>, shall appear in the new process image
as though <i>fork</i>() had been called to create a child
process and then a member of the <i>exec</i> family of
functions had been called by the child process to execute
the new process image.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is
implementation-defined whether the fork handlers are run

<h2>RATIONALE
<a name="RATIONALE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>posix_spawn</i>() function and its close relation
<i>posix_spawnp</i>() have been introduced to overcome the
following perceived difficulties with <i>fork</i>(): the
<i>fork</i>() function is difficult or impossible to
implement without swapping or dynamic address
translation.</p>

<td width="1%"></td>
<td width="85%">


<p>Processes are too useful to simply option out of POSIX

MMU services.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Thus, POSIX
needs process creation and file execution primitives that
can be efficiently implemented without address translation
or other MMU services.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>posix_spawn</i>() function is implementable as a library
routine, but both <i>posix_spawn</i>() and
<i>posix_spawnp</i>() are designed as kernel operations.
Also, although they may be an efficient replacement for many
<i>fork</i>()/ <i>exec</i> pairs, their goal is to provide
useful process creation primitives for systems that have
difficulty with <i>fork</i>(), not to provide drop-in
replacements for <i>fork</i>()/ <i>exec</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This view of
the role of <i>posix_spawn</i>() and <i>posix_spawnp</i>()
influenced the design of their API. It does not attempt to
provide the full functionality of <i>fork</i>()/ <i>exec</i>
in which arbitrary user-specified operations of any sort are
permitted between the creation of the child process and the
execution of the new process image; any attempt to reach
that level would need to provide a programming language as
parameters. Instead, <i>posix_spawn</i>() and
<i>posix_spawnp</i>() are process creation primitives like
the <i>Start_Process</i> and <i>Start_Process_Search</i> Ada
language bindings package <i>POSIX_Process_Primitives</i>
and also like those in many operating systems that are not
UNIX systems, but with some POSIX-specific additions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To achieve its
coverage goals, <i>posix_spawn</i>() and
<i>posix_spawnp</i>() have control of six types of
inheritance: file descriptors, process group ID, user and
group ID, signal mask, scheduling, and whether each signal
ignored in the parent will remain ignored in the child, or
be reset to its default action in the child.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Control of file
descriptors is required to allow an independently written
child process image to access data streams opened by and
even generated or read by the parent process without being
specifically coded to know which parent files and file
descriptors are to be used. Control of the process group ID
is required to control how the child process&rsquo; job
control relates to that of the parent.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Control of the
signal mask and signal defaulting is sufficient to support
the implementation of <i>system</i>(). Although support for
<i>system</i>() is not explicitly one of the goals for
<i>posix_spawn</i>() and <i>posix_spawnp</i>(), it is
covered under the &quot;at least 50%&quot; coverage
goal.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The intention
is that the normal file descriptor inheritance across
<i>fork</i>(), the subsequent effect of the specified spawn
file actions, and the normal file descriptor inheritance
across one of the <i>exec</i> family of functions should
fully specify open file inheritance. The implementation need
make no decisions regarding the set of open file descriptors
when the child process image begins execution, those
decisions having already been made by the caller and
expressed as the set of open file descriptors and their
FD_CLOEXEC flags at the time of the call and the spawn file
actions object specified in the call. We have been assured
that in cases where the POSIX <i>Start_Process</i> Ada
primitives have been implemented in a library, this method
of controlling file descriptor inheritance may be
implemented very easily.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">We can identify
several problems with <i>posix_spawn</i>() and
<i>posix_spawnp</i>(), but there does not appear to be a
solution that introduces fewer problems. Environment
modification for child process attributes not specifiable
via the <i>attrp</i> or <i>file_actions</i> arguments must
be done in the parent process, and since the parent
generally wants to save its context, it is more costly than
similar functionality with <i>fork</i>()/ <i>exec</i>. It is
also complicated to modify the environment of a
multi-threaded process temporarily, since all threads must
agree when it is safe for the environment to be changed.
However, this cost is only borne by those invocations of
<i>posix_spawn</i>() and <i>posix_spawnp</i>() that use the
additional functionality. Since extensive modifications are
not the usual case, and are particularly unlikely in
time-critical code, keeping much of the environment control
out of <i>posix_spawn</i>() and <i>posix_spawnp</i>() is
appropriate design.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>posix_spawn</i>() and <i>posix_spawnp</i>() functions do
not have all the power of <i>fork</i>()/ <i>exec</i>. This
is to be expected. The <i>fork</i>() function is a
wonderfully powerful operation. We do not expect to
duplicate its functionality in a simple, fast function with
no special hardware requirements. It is worth noting that
<i>posix_spawn</i>() and <i>posix_spawnp</i>() are very
similar to the process creation operations on many operating
systems that are not UNIX systems.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Two-Syntax</b>
<br>
POSIX <i>exec</i> has several calling sequences with
approximately the same functionality. These appear to be
required for compatibility with existing practice. Since the
existing practice for the <i>posix_spawn*</i>() functions is
otherwise substantially unlike POSIX, we feel that
simplicity outweighs compatibility. There are, therefore,
only two names for the <i>posix_spawn*</i>() functions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The parameter
list does not differ between <i>posix_spawn</i>() and
<i>posix_spawnp</i>(); <i>posix_spawnp</i>() interprets the
second parameter more elaborately than
<i>posix_spawn</i>().</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Compatibility
with POSIX.5 (Ada)</b> <br>
The <i>Start_Process</i> and <i>Start_Process_Search</i>
procedures from the <i>POSIX_Process_Primitives</i> package
from the Ada language binding to POSIX.1 encapsulate
<i>fork</i>() and <i>exec</i> functionality in a manner
similar to that of <i>posix_spawn</i>() and
<i>posix_spawnp</i>(). Originally, in keeping with our
simplicity goal, the standard developers had limited the
capabilities of <i>posix_spawn</i>() and
<i>posix_spawnp</i>() to a subset of the capabilities of
<i>Start_Process</i> and <i>Start_Process_Search</i>;
certain non-default capabilities were not supported.
However, based on suggestions by the ballot group to improve
file descriptor mapping or drop it, and on the advice of an
Ada Language Bindings working group member, the standard
developers decided that <i>posix_spawn</i>() and
<i>posix_spawnp</i>() should be sufficiently powerful to
implement <i>Start_Process</i> and
<i>Start_Process_Search</i>. The rationale is that if the
Ada language binding to such a primitive had already been
approved as an IEEE standard, there can be little
justification for not approving the functionally-equivalent
parts of a C binding. The only three capabilities provided
by <i>posix_spawn</i>() and <i>posix_spawnp</i>() that are
not provided by <i>Start_Process</i> and
<i>Start_Process_Search</i> are optionally specifying the
child&rsquo;s process group ID, the set of signals to be
reset to default signal handling in the child process, and
the child&rsquo;s scheduling policy and parameters.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For the Ada
language binding for <i>Start_Process</i> to be implemented
with <i>posix_spawn</i>(), that binding would need to
explicitly pass an empty signal mask and the parent&rsquo;s
environment to <i>posix_spawn</i>() whenever the caller of
<i>Start_Process</i> allowed these arguments to default,
since <i>posix_spawn</i>() does not provide such defaults.
The ability of <i>Start_Process</i> to mask user-specified
signals during its execution is functionally unique to the
Ada language binding and must be dealt with in the binding
separately from the call to <i>posix_spawn</i>().</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Process
Group</b> <br>
The process group inheritance field can be used to join the
child process with an existing process group. By assigning a
value of zero to the <i>spawn-pgroup</i> attribute of the
object referenced by <i>attrp</i>, the <i>setpgid</i>()
mechanism will place the child process in a new process
group.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Threads</b>
<br>
Without the <i>posix_spawn</i>() and <i>posix_spawnp</i>()
functions, systems without address translation can still use
threads to give an abstraction of concurrency. In many
cases, thread creation suffices, but it is not always a good
substitute. The <i>posix_spawn</i>() and
<i>posix_spawnp</i>() functions are considerably
&quot;heavier&quot; than thread creation. Processes have
several important attributes that threads do not. Even
without address translation, a process may have
base-and-bound memory protection. Each process has a process
environment including security attributes and file
capabilities, and powerful scheduling attributes. Processes
abstract the behavior of non-uniform-memory-architecture
multi-processors better than threads, and they are more
convenient to use for activities that are not closely
linked.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>posix_spawn</i>() and <i>posix_spawnp</i>() functions may
not bring support for multiple processes to every
configuration. Process creation is not the only piece of
operating system support required to support multiple
processes. The total cost of support for multiple processes
may be quite high in some circumstances. Existing practice
shows that support for multiple processes is uncommon and
threads are common among &quot;tiny kernels&quot;. There
should, therefore, probably continue to be AEPs for
operating systems with only one process.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Asynchronous
Error Notification</b> <br>
A library implementation of <i>posix_spawn</i>() or
<i>posix_spawnp</i>() may not be able to detect all possible
errors before it forks the child process.
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 provides for an error
indication returned from a child process which could not
successfully complete the spawn operation via a special exit
status which may be detected using the status value returned
by <i>wait</i>() and <i>waitpid</i>().</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>stat_val</i> interface and the macros used to interpret
it are not well suited to the purpose of returning API
errors, but they are the only path available to a library
implementation. Thus, an implementation may cause the child
process to exit with exit status 127 for any error detected
during the spawn process after the <i>posix_spawn</i>() or
<i>posix_spawnp</i>() function has successfully
returned.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The standard
developers had proposed using two additional macros to
interpret <i>stat_val</i>. The first, WIFSPAWNFAIL, would
have detected a status that indicated that the child exited
because of an error detected during the <i>posix_spawn</i>()
or <i>posix_spawnp</i>() operations rather than during
actual execution of the child process image; the second,
WSPAWNERRNO, would have extracted the error value if
WIFSPAWNFAIL indicated a failure. Unfortunately, the ballot
group strongly opposed this because it would make a library
implementation of <i>posix_spawn</i>() or
<i>posix_spawnp</i>() dependent on kernel modifications to
<i>waitpid</i>() to be able to embed special information in
<i>stat_val</i> to indicate a spawn failure.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The 8 bits of
child process exit status that are guaranteed by
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 to be accessible to the
waiting parent process are insufficient to disambiguate a
spawn error from any other kind of error that may be
returned by an arbitrary process image. No other bits of the
exit status are required to be visible in <i>stat_val</i>,
so these macros could not be strictly implemented at the
library level. Reserving an exit status of 127 for such
spawn errors is consistent with the use of this value by
<i>system</i>() and <i>popen</i>() to signal failures in
these operations that occur after the function has returned
but before a shell is able to execute. The exit status of
127 does not uniquely identify this class of error, nor does
it provide any detailed information on the nature of the
failure. Note that a kernel implementation of
<i>posix_spawn</i>() or <i>posix_spawnp</i>() is permitted
(and encouraged) to return any possible error as the
function value, thus providing more detailed failure
information to the parent process.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Thus, no
special macros are available to isolate asynchronous
<i>posix_spawn</i>() or <i>posix_spawnp</i>() errors.
Instead, errors detected by the <i>posix_spawn</i>() or
<i>posix_spawnp</i>() operations in the context of the child
process before the new process image executes are reported
by setting the child&rsquo;s exit status to 127. The calling
process may use the WIFEXITED and WEXITSTATUS macros on the
<i>stat_val</i> stored by the <i>wait</i>() or
<i>waitpid</i>() functions to detect spawn failures to the
extent that other status values with which the child process
image may exit (before the parent can conclusively determine
that the child process image has begun execution) are
distinct from exit status 127.</p>
