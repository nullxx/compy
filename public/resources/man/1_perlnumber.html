<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This document
describes how Perl internally handles numeric values.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Perl&rsquo;s
operator overloading facility is completely ignored here.
Operator overloading allows user-defined behaviors for
numbers, such as operations over arbitrarily large integers,
floating points numbers with arbitrary precision, operations
over &quot;exotic&quot; numbers such as modular arithmetic
or p&minus;adic arithmetic, and so on. See overload for
details.</p>

<h2>Storing numbers
<a name="Storing numbers"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Perl can
internally represent numbers in 3 different ways: as native
integers, as native floating point numbers, and as decimal
strings. Decimal strings may have an exponential notation
part, as in <tt>&quot;12.34e&minus;56&quot;</tt>.
<i>Native</i> here means &quot;a format supported by the C
compiler which was used to build perl&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The term
&quot;native&quot; does not mean quite as much when we talk
about native integers, as it does when native floating point
numbers are involved. The only implication of the term
&quot;native&quot; on integers is that the limits for the
maximal and the minimal supported true integral quantities
are close to powers of 2. However, &quot;native&quot; floats
have a most fundamental restriction: they may represent only
those numbers which have a relatively &quot;short&quot;
representation when converted to a binary fraction. For
example, 0.9 cannot be represented by a native float, since
the binary fraction for 0.9 is infinite:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  binary0.1110011001100...</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">with the
sequence <tt>1100</tt> repeating again and again. In
addition to this limitation, the exponent of the binary
number is also restricted when it is represented as a
floating point number. On typical hardware, floating point
values can store numbers with up to 53 binary digits, and
with binary exponents between &minus;1024 and 1024. In
decimal representation this is close to 16 decimal digits
and decimal exponents in the range of &minus;304..304. The
upshot of all this is that Perl cannot store a number like
12345678901234567 as a floating point number on such
architectures without loss of information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Similarly,
decimal strings can represent only those numbers which have
a finite decimal expansion. Being strings, and thus of
arbitrary length, there is no practical limit for the
exponent or number of decimal digits for these numbers. (But
realize that what we are discussing the rules for just the
<i>storage</i> of these numbers. The fact that you can store
such &quot;large&quot; numbers does not mean that the
<i>operations</i> over these numbers will use all of the
significant digits. See &quot;Numeric operators and numeric
conversions&quot; for details.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In fact numbers
stored in the native integer format may be stored either in
the signed native form, or in the unsigned native form. Thus
the limits for Perl numbers stored as native integers would
typically be &minus;2**31..2**32&minus;1, with appropriate
modifications in the case of 64&minus;bit integers. Again,
this does not mean that Perl can do operations only over
integers in this range: it is possible to store many more
integers in floating point format.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Summing up,
Perl numeric values can store only those numbers which have
a finite decimal expansion or a &quot;short&quot; binary
expansion.</p>

<h2>Numeric operators and numeric conversions
<a name="Numeric operators and numeric conversions"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As mentioned
earlier, Perl can store a number in any one of three
formats, but most operators typically understand only one of
those formats. When a numeric value is passed as an argument
to such an operator, it will be converted to the format
understood by the operator.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Six such
conversions are possible:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  native integer        &minus;&minus;&gt; native floating point       (*)
  native integer        &minus;&minus;&gt; decimal string
  native floating_point &minus;&minus;&gt; native integer              (*)
  native floating_point &minus;&minus;&gt; decimal string              (*)
  decimal string        &minus;&minus;&gt; native integer
  decimal string        &minus;&minus;&gt; native floating point       (*)</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These
conversions are governed by the following general rules:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>&bull;</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>If the source number can be represented in the target
form, that representation is used.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>&bull;</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>If the source number is outside of the limits
representable in the target form, a representation of the
closest limit is used. (<i>Loss of information</i>)</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>&bull;</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>If the source number is between two numbers
representable in the target form, a representation of one of
these numbers is used. (<i>Loss of information</i>)</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>&bull;</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>In <tt>&quot;native floating point &minus;&minus;&gt;
native integer&quot;</tt> conversions the magnitude of the
result is less than or equal to the magnitude of the source.
(<i>&quot;Rounding to zero&quot;.</i>)</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>&bull;</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>If the <tt>&quot;decimal string &minus;&minus;&gt;
native integer&quot;</tt> conversion cannot be done without
loss of information, the result is compatible with the
conversion sequence <tt>&quot;decimal_string
&minus;&minus;&gt; native_floating_point &minus;&minus;&gt;
native_integer&quot;</tt>. In particular, rounding is
strongly biased to 0, though a number like
<tt>&quot;0.99999999999999999999&quot;</tt> has a chance of
being rounded to 1.</p></td></tr>
</table>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b><small>RESTRICTION</small></b>
: The conversions marked with <tt>&quot;(*)&quot;</tt> above
involve steps performed by the C compiler. In particular,
bugs/features of the compiler used may lead to breakage of
some of the above rules.</p>

<h2>Flavors of Perl numeric operations
<a name="Flavors of Perl numeric operations"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Perl operations
which take a numeric argument treat that argument in one of
four different ways: they may force it to one of the
integer/floating/ string formats, or they may behave
differently depending on the format of the operand. Forcing
a numeric value to a particular format does not change the
number stored in the value.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">All the
operators which need an argument in the integer format treat
the argument as in modular arithmetic, e.g., <tt>&quot;mod
2**32&quot;</tt> on a 32&minus;bit architecture.
<tt>&quot;sprintf &quot;%u&quot;, &minus;1&quot;</tt>
therefore provides the same result as <tt>&quot;sprintf
&quot;%u&quot;, ~0&quot;</tt>. <br>
Arithmetic operators</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The binary operators
<tt>&quot;+&quot; &quot;&minus;&quot; &quot;*&quot;
&quot;/&quot; &quot;%&quot; &quot;==&quot; &quot;!=&quot;
&quot;&gt;&quot; &quot;&lt;&quot; &quot;&gt;=&quot;
&quot;&lt;=&quot;</tt> and the unary operators
<tt>&quot;&minus;&quot; &quot;abs&quot;</tt> and
<tt>&quot;&minus;&minus;&quot;</tt> will attempt to convert
arguments to integers. If both conversions are possible
without loss of precision, and the operation can be
performed without loss of precision then the integer result
is used. Otherwise arguments are converted to floating point
format and the floating point result is used. The caching of
conversions (as described above) means that the integer
conversion does not throw away fractional parts on floating
point numbers.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p>++</p></td>
<td width="3%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p><tt>&quot;++&quot;</tt> behaves as the other operators
above, except that if it is a string matching the format
<tt>&quot;/^[a&minus;zA&minus;Z]*[0&minus;9]*\z/&quot;</tt>
the string increment described in perlop is used.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Arithmetic operators during
&quot;use integer&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">In scopes where <tt>&quot;use
integer;&quot;</tt> is in force, nearly all the operators
listed above will force their argument(s) into integer
format, and return an integer result. The exceptions,
<tt>&quot;abs&quot;</tt>, <tt>&quot;++&quot;</tt> and
<tt>&quot;&minus;&minus;&quot;</tt>, do not change their
behavior with <tt>&quot;use integer;&quot;</tt></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Other mathematical
operators</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Operators such as
<tt>&quot;**&quot;</tt>, <tt>&quot;sin&quot;</tt> and
<tt>&quot;exp&quot;</tt> force arguments to floating point
format.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Bitwise operators</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Arguments are forced into the
integer format if not strings.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Bitwise operators during
&quot;use integer&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">forces arguments to integer
format. Also shift operations internally use signed integers
rather than the default unsigned.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Operators which expect an
integer</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">force the argument into the
integer format. This is applicable to the third and fourth
arguments of <tt>&quot;sysread&quot;</tt>, for example.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Operators which expect a
string</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">force the argument into the
string format. For example, this is applicable to
<tt>&quot;printf &quot;%s&quot;, $value&quot;</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Though forcing
an argument into a particular form does not change the
stored number, Perl remembers the result of such
conversions. In particular, though the first such conversion
may be time-consuming, repeated operations will not need to
redo the conversion.</p>
