<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Reads the tree
information given by &lt;tree&minus;ish&gt; into the index,
but does not actually <b>update</b> any of the files it
&quot;caches&quot;. (see: <b>git-checkout-index</b>(1))</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Optionally, it
can merge a tree into the index, perform a
fast&minus;forward (i.e. 2&minus;way) merge, or a
3&minus;way merge, with the &minus;m flag. When used with
&minus;m, the &minus;u flag causes it to also update the
files in the work tree with the result of the merge.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Trivial merges
are done by <i>git read&minus;tree</i> itself. Only
conflicting paths will be in unmerged state when <i>git
read&minus;tree</i> returns.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;m</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Perform a merge, not just a
read. The command will refuse to run if your index file has
unmerged entries, indicating that you have not finished
previous merge you started.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;reset</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Same as &minus;m, except that
unmerged entries are discarded instead of failing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;u</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">After a successful merge,
update the files in the work tree with the result of the
merge.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;i</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Usually a merge requires the
index file as well as the files in the working tree to be up
to date with the current head commit, in order not to lose
local changes. This flag disables the check with the working
tree and is meant to be used when creating a merge of trees
that are not directly related to the current working tree
status into a temporary index file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;n,
&minus;&minus;dry&minus;run</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Check if the command would
error out, without updating the index nor the files in the
working tree for real.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;v</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Show the progress of checking
files out.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;trivial</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Restrict three&minus;way merge
by <i>git read&minus;tree</i> to happen only if there is no
file&minus;level merging required, instead of resolving
merge for trivial cases and leaving conflicting files
unresolved in the index.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;aggressive</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Usually a three&minus;way merge
by <i>git read&minus;tree</i> resolves the merge for really
trivial cases and leaves other cases unresolved in the
index, so that porcelains can implement different merge
policies. This flag makes the command resolve a few more
cases internally:</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; when one
side removes a path and the other side leaves the path
unmodified. The resolution is to remove that path.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; when
both sides remove a path. The resolution is to remove that
path.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; when
both sides add a path identically. The resolution is to add
that path.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;prefix=&lt;prefix&gt;/</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Keep the current index
contents, and read the contents of the named tree&minus;ish
under the directory at &lt;prefix&gt;. The command will
refuse to overwrite entries that already existed in the
original index file. Note that the &lt;prefix&gt;/ value
must end with a slash.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;exclude&minus;per&minus;directory=&lt;gitignore&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When running the command with
&minus;u and &minus;m options, the merge result may need to
overwrite paths that are not tracked in the current branch.
The command usually refuses to proceed with the merge to
avoid losing such a path. However this safety valve
sometimes gets in the way. For example, it often happens
that the other branch added a file that used to be a
generated file in your branch, and the safety valve triggers
when you try to switch to that branch after you ran make but
before running make clean to remove the generated file. This
option tells the command to read per&minus;directory exclude
file (usually <i>.gitignore</i>) and allows such an
untracked but explicitly ignored file to be overwritten.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;index&minus;output=&lt;file&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Instead of writing the results
out to $GIT_INDEX_FILE, write the resulting index in the
named file. While the command is operating, the original
index file is locked with the same mechanism as usual. The
file must allow to be rename(2)ed into from a temporary file
that is created next to the usual index file; typically this
means it needs to be on the same filesystem as the index
file itself, and you need write permission to the
directories the index file and index output file are located
in.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;no&minus;sparse&minus;checkout</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Disable sparse checkout support
even if core.sparseCheckout is true.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;empty</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Instead of reading tree
object(s) into the index, just empty it.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&lt;tree&minus;ish#&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The id of the tree object(s) to
be read/merged.</p>

<h2>MERGING
<a name="MERGING"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If &minus;m is
specified, <i>git read&minus;tree</i> can perform 3 kinds of
merge, a single tree merge if only 1 tree is given, a
fast&minus;forward merge with 2 trees, or a 3&minus;way
merge if 3 trees are provided.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Single Tree
Merge</b> <br>
If only 1 tree is specified, <i>git read&minus;tree</i>
operates as if the user did not specify &minus;m, except
that if the original index has an entry for a given
pathname, and the contents of the path match with the tree
being read, the stat info from the index is used. (In other
words, the index&rsquo;s stat()s take precedence over the
merged tree&rsquo;s).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">That means that
if you do a git read&minus;tree &minus;m &lt;newtree&gt;
followed by a git checkout&minus;index &minus;f &minus;u
&minus;a, the <i>git checkout&minus;index</i> only checks
out the stuff that really changed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This is used to
avoid unnecessary false hits when <i>git
diff&minus;files</i> is run after <i>git
read&minus;tree</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Two Tree
Merge</b> <br>
Typically, this is invoked as git read&minus;tree &minus;m
$H $M, where $H is the head commit of the current
repository, and $M is the head of a foreign tree, which is
simply ahead of $H (i.e. we are in a fast&minus;forward
situation).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When two trees
are specified, the user is telling <i>git
read&minus;tree</i> the following:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">1. The current
index and work tree is derived from $H, but the user may
have local changes in them since $H.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">2. The user
wants to fast&minus;forward to $M.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In this case,
the git read&minus;tree &minus;m $H $M command makes sure
that no local change is lost as the result of this
&quot;merge&quot;. Here are the &quot;carry forward&quot;
rules, where &quot;I&quot; denotes the index,
&quot;clean&quot; means that index and work tree coincide,
and &quot;exists&quot;/&quot;nothing&quot; refer to the
presence of a path in the specified commit:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">I H M Result
<br>

<br>
0 nothing nothing nothing (does not happen) <br>
1 nothing nothing exists use M <br>
2 nothing exists nothing remove path from index <br>
3 nothing exists exists, use M if &quot;initial
checkout&quot;, <br>
H == M keep index otherwise <br>
exists, fail <br>
H != M</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">clean I==H I==M
<br>

&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;
<br>
4 yes N/A N/A nothing nothing keep index <br>
5 no N/A N/A nothing nothing keep index</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">6 yes N/A yes
nothing exists keep index <br>
7 no N/A yes nothing exists keep index <br>
8 yes N/A no nothing exists fail <br>
9 no N/A no nothing exists fail</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">10 yes yes N/A
exists nothing remove path from index <br>
11 no yes N/A exists nothing fail <br>
12 yes no N/A exists nothing fail <br>
13 no no N/A exists nothing fail</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">clean (H==M)
<br>
&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus; <br>
14 yes exists exists keep index <br>
15 no exists exists keep index</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">clean I==H I==M
(H!=M) <br>

&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;
<br>
16 yes no no exists exists fail <br>
17 no no no exists exists fail <br>
18 yes no yes exists exists keep index <br>
19 no no yes exists exists keep index <br>
20 yes yes no exists exists use M <br>
21 no yes no exists exists fail</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In all
&quot;keep index&quot; cases, the index entry stays as in
the original index file. If the entry is not up to date,
<i>git read&minus;tree</i> keeps the copy in the work tree
intact when operating under the &minus;u flag.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When this form
of <i>git read&minus;tree</i> returns successfully, you can
see which of the &quot;local changes&quot; that you made
were carried forward by running git diff&minus;index
&minus;&minus;cached $M. Note that this does not necessarily
match what git diff&minus;index &minus;&minus;cached $H
would have produced before such a two tree merge. This is
because of cases 18 and 19 &minus;&minus;&minus; if you
already had the changes in $M (e.g. maybe you picked it up
via e&minus;mail in a patch form), git diff&minus;index
&minus;&minus;cached $H would have told you about the change
before this merge, but it would not show in git
diff&minus;index &minus;&minus;cached $M output after the
two&minus;tree merge.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Case 3 is
slightly tricky and needs explanation. The result from this
rule logically should be to remove the path if the user
staged the removal of the path and then switching to a new
branch. That however will prevent the initial checkout from
happening, so the rule is modified to use M (new tree) only
when the content of the index is empty. Otherwise the
removal of the path is kept as long as $H and $M are the
same.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>3&minus;Way
Merge</b> <br>
Each &quot;index&quot; entry has two bits worth of
&quot;stage&quot; state. stage 0 is the normal one, and is
the only one you&rsquo;d see in any kind of normal use.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">However, when
you do <i>git read&minus;tree</i> with three trees, the
&quot;stage&quot; starts out at 1.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This means that
you can do</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">$ git
read&minus;tree &minus;m &lt;tree1&gt; &lt;tree2&gt;
&lt;tree3&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">and you will
end up with an index with all of the &lt;tree1&gt; entries
in &quot;stage1&quot;, all of the &lt;tree2&gt; entries in
&quot;stage2&quot; and all of the &lt;tree3&gt; entries in
&quot;stage3&quot;. When performing a merge of another
branch into the current branch, we use the common ancestor
tree as &lt;tree1&gt;, the current branch head as
&lt;tree2&gt;, and the other branch head as
&lt;tree3&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Furthermore,
<i>git read&minus;tree</i> has special&minus;case logic that
says: if you see a file that matches in all respects in the
following states, it &quot;collapses&quot; back to
&quot;stage0&quot;:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; stage 2
and 3 are the same; take one or the other (it makes no
difference &minus; the same work has been done on our branch
in stage 2 and their branch in stage 3)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; stage 1
and stage 2 are the same and stage 3 is different; take
stage 3 (our branch in stage 2 did not do anything since the
ancestor in stage 1 while their branch in stage 3 worked on
it)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; stage 1
and stage 3 are the same and stage 2 is different take stage
2 (we did something while they did nothing)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The <i>git
write&minus;tree</i> command refuses to write a nonsensical
tree, and it will complain about unmerged entries if it sees
a single entry that is not stage 0.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">OK, this all
sounds like a collection of totally nonsensical rules, but
it&rsquo;s actually exactly what you want in order to do a
fast merge. The different stages represent the &quot;result
tree&quot; (stage 0, aka &quot;merged&quot;), the original
tree (stage 1, aka &quot;orig&quot;), and the two trees you
are trying to merge (stage 2 and 3 respectively).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The order of
stages 1, 2 and 3 (hence the order of three
&lt;tree&minus;ish&gt; command line arguments) are
significant when you start a 3&minus;way merge with an index
file that is already populated. Here is an outline of how
the algorithm works:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; if a
file exists in identical format in all three trees, it will
automatically collapse to &quot;merged&quot; state by <i>git
read&minus;tree</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; a file
that has <i>any</i> difference what&minus;so&minus;ever in
the three trees will stay as separate entries in the index.
It&rsquo;s up to &quot;porcelain policy&quot; to determine
how to remove the non&minus;0 stages, and insert a merged
version.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; the
index file saves and restores with all this information, so
you can merge things incrementally, but as long as it has
entries in stages 1/2/3 (i.e., &quot;unmerged entries&quot;)
you can&rsquo;t write the result. So now the merge algorithm
ends up being really simple:</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; you walk
the index in order, and ignore all entries of stage 0, since
they&rsquo;ve already been done.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; if you
find a &quot;stage1&quot;, but no matching
&quot;stage2&quot; or &quot;stage3&quot;, you know
it&rsquo;s been removed from both trees (it only existed in
the original tree), and you remove that entry.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; if you
find a matching &quot;stage2&quot; and &quot;stage3&quot;
tree, you remove one of them, and turn the other into a
&quot;stage0&quot; entry. Remove any matching
&quot;stage1&quot; entry if it exists too. .. all the normal
trivial rules ..</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You would
normally use <i>git merge&minus;index</i> with supplied
<i>git merge&minus;one&minus;file</i> to do this last step.
The script updates the files in the working tree as it
merges each path and at the end of a successful merge.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When you start
a 3&minus;way merge with an index file that is already
populated, it is assumed that it represents the state of the
files in your work tree, and you can even have files with
changes unrecorded in the index file. It is further assumed
that this state is &quot;derived&quot; from the stage 2
tree. The 3&minus;way merge refuses to run if it finds an
entry in the original index file that does not match stage
2.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This is done to
prevent you from losing your work&minus;in&minus;progress
changes, and mixing your random changes in an unrelated
merge commit. To illustrate, suppose you start from what has
been committed last to your repository:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">$ JC=&lsquo;git
rev&minus;parse &minus;&minus;verify
&quot;HEAD^0&quot;&lsquo; <br>
$ git checkout&minus;index &minus;f &minus;u &minus;a
$JC</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You do random
edits, without running <i>git update&minus;index</i>. And
then you notice that the tip of your &quot;upstream&quot;
tree has advanced since you pulled from him:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">$ git fetch
git://.... linus <br>
$ LT=&lsquo;git rev&minus;parse FETCH_HEAD&lsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Your work tree
is still based on your HEAD ($JC), but you have some edits
since. Three&minus;way merge makes sure that you have not
added or modified index entries since $JC, and if you
haven&rsquo;t, then does the right thing. So with the
following sequence:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">$ git
read&minus;tree &minus;m &minus;u &lsquo;git
merge&minus;base $JC $LT&lsquo; $JC $LT <br>
$ git merge&minus;index git&minus;merge&minus;one&minus;file
&minus;a <br>
$ echo &quot;Merge with Linus&quot; | \ <br>
git commit&minus;tree &lsquo;git write&minus;tree&lsquo;
&minus;p $JC &minus;p $LT</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">what you would
commit is a pure merge between $JC and $LT without your
work&minus;in&minus;progress changes, and your work tree
would be updated to the result of the merge.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">However, if you
have local changes in the working tree that would be
overwritten by this merge, <i>git read&minus;tree</i> will
refuse to run to prevent your changes from being lost.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In other words,
there is no need to worry about what exists only in the
working tree. When you have local changes in a part of the
project that is not involved in the merge, your changes do
not interfere with the merge, and are kept intact. When they
<b>do</b> interfere, the merge does not even start (<i>git
read&minus;tree</i> complains loudly and fails without
modifying anything). In such a case, you can simply continue
doing what you were in the middle of doing, and when your
working tree is ready (i.e. you have finished your
work&minus;in&minus;progress), attempt the merge again.</p>

<h2>SPARSE CHECKOUT
<a name="SPARSE CHECKOUT"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;Sparse
checkout&quot; allows populating the working directory
sparsely. It uses the skip&minus;worktree bit (see
<b>git-update-index</b>(1)) to tell Git whether a file in
the working directory is worth looking at.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>git
read&minus;tree</i> and other merge&minus;based commands
(<i>git merge</i>, <i>git checkout</i>...) can help
maintaining the skip&minus;worktree bitmap and working
directory update. $GIT_DIR/info/sparse&minus;checkout is
used to define the skip&minus;worktree reference bitmap.
When <i>git read&minus;tree</i> needs to update the working
directory, it resets the skip&minus;worktree bit in the
index based on this file, which uses the same syntax as
.gitignore files. If an entry matches a pattern in this
file, skip&minus;worktree will not be set on that entry.
Otherwise, skip&minus;worktree will be set.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Then it
compares the new skip&minus;worktree value with the previous
one. If skip&minus;worktree turns from set to unset, it will
add the corresponding file back. If it turns from unset to
set, that file will be removed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">While
$GIT_DIR/info/sparse&minus;checkout is usually used to
specify what files are in, you can also specify what files
are <i>not</i> in, using negate patterns. For example, to
remove the file unwanted:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">/* <br>
!unwanted</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Another tricky
thing is fully repopulating the working directory when you
no longer want sparse checkout. You cannot just disable
&quot;sparse checkout&quot; because skip&minus;worktree bits
are still in the index and your working directory is still
sparsely populated. You should re&minus;populate the working
directory with the $GIT_DIR/info/sparse&minus;checkout file
content as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">/*</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Then you can
disable sparse checkout. Sparse checkout support in <i>git
read&minus;tree</i> and similar commands is disabled by
default. You need to turn core.sparseCheckout on in order to
have sparse checkout support.</p>
