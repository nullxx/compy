<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">logrotate -
rotates, compresses, and mails system logs</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>logrotate</b>
[<b>&minus;dv</b>]
[<b>&minus;f</b>|<b>&minus;&minus;force</b>]
[<b>&minus;s</b>|<b>&minus;&minus;state</b> <i>file</i>]
<i>config_file</i> ..</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>logrotate</b>
is designed to ease administration of systems that generate
large numbers of log files. It allows automatic rotation,
compression, removal, and mailing of log files. Each log
file may be handled daily, weekly, monthly, or when it grows
too large.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Normally,
<b>logrotate</b> is run as a daily cron job. It will not
modify a log multiple times in one day unless the criterion
for that log is based on the log&rsquo;s size and
<b>logrotate</b> is being run multiple times each day, or
unless the <b>&minus;f</b> or <b>&minus;&minus;force</b>
option is used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Any number of
config files may be given on the command line. Later config
files may override the options given in earlier files, so
the order in which the <b>logrotate</b> config files are
listed is important. Normally, a single config file which
includes any other config files which are needed should be
used. See below for more information on how to use the
<b>include</b> directive to accomplish this. If a directory
is given on the command line, every file in that directory
is used as a config file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If no command
line arguments are given, <b>logrotate</b> will print
version and copyright information, along with a short usage
summary. If any errors occur while rotating logs,
<b>logrotate</b> will exit with non-zero status.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;?</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;help</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Prints help message.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;d</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;debug</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Turns on debug mode and implies
<b>-v</b>. In debug mode, no changes will be made to the
logs or to the <b>logrotate</b> state file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;f</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;force</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Tells <b>logrotate</b> to force
the rotation, even if it doesn&rsquo;t think this is
necessary. Sometimes this is useful after adding new entries
to a <b>logrotate</b> config file, or if old log files have
been removed by hand, as the new files will be created, and
logging will continue correctly.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;m</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;mail &lt;command&gt;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Tells <b>logrotate</b> which
command to use when mailing logs. This command should accept
two arguments: 1) the subject of the message, and 2) the
recipient. The command must then read a message on standard
input and mail it to the recipient. The default mail command
is <b>/bin/mail -s</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;s</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;state &lt;statefile&gt;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Tells <b>logrotate</b> to use
an alternate state file. This is useful if logrotate is
being run as a different user for various sets of log files.
The default state file is
<i>/var/lib/logrotate.status</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;usage</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Prints a short usage
message.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">+<b>&minus;v</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;verbose</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Turns on verbose mode.</p>

<h2>CONFIGURATION FILE
<a name="CONFIGURATION FILE"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>logrotate</b>
reads everything about the log files it should be handling
from the series of configuration files specified on the
command line. Each configuration file can set global options
(local definitions override global ones, and later
definitions override earlier ones) and specify logfiles to
rotate. A simple configuration file looks like this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"># sample
logrotate configuration file <br>
compress</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">/var/log/messages
{ <br>
rotate 5 <br>
weekly <br>
postrotate <br>
/usr/bin/killall &minus;HUP syslogd <br>
endscript <br>
}</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;/var/log/httpd/access.log&quot;
/var/log/httpd/error.log { <br>
rotate 5 <br>
mail www@my.org <br>
size 100k <br>
sharedscripts <br>
postrotate <br>
/usr/bin/killall &minus;HUP httpd <br>
endscript <br>
}</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">/var/log/news/*
{ <br>
monthly <br>
rotate 2 <br>
olddir /var/log/news/old <br>
missingok <br>
postrotate <br>
kill &minus;HUP &lsquo;cat /var/run/inn.pid&lsquo; <br>
endscript <br>
nocompress <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">~/log/*.log
{}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The first few
lines set global options; in the example, logs are
compressed after they are rotated. Note that comments may
appear anywhere in the config file as long as the first
non-whitespace character on the line is a #.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The next
section of the config files defined how to handle the log
file <i>/var/log/messages</i>. The log will go through five
weekly rotations before being removed. After the log file
has been rotated (but before the old version of the log has
been compressed), the command <i>/sbin/killall &minus;HUP
syslogd</i> will be executed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The next
section defines the parameters for both
<i>/var/log/httpd/access.log</i> and
<i>/var/log/httpd/error.log</i>. They are rotated whenever
it grows over 100k in size, and the old logs files are
mailed (uncompressed) to www@my.org after going through 5
rotations, rather than being removed. The
<b>sharedscripts</b> means that the <b>postrotate</b> script
will only be run once (after the old logs have been
compressed), not once for each log which is rotated. Note
that the double quotes around the first filename at the
beginning of this section allows logrotate to rotate logs
with spaces in the name. Normal shell quoting rules apply,
with &rsquo;, &quot;, and \ characters supported.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The next
section defines the parameters for all of the files in
<i>/var/log/news</i>. Each file is rotated on a monthly
basis. This is considered a single rotation directive and if
errors occur for more than one file, the log files are not
compressed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The last
section uses tilde expansion to rotate log files in the home
directory of the current user. This is only available, if
your glob library supports tilde expansion. GNU glob does
support this.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Please use
wildcards with caution. If you specify *, <b>logrotate</b>
will rotate all files, including previously rotated ones. A
way around this is to use the <b>olddir</b> directive or a
more exact wildcard (such as *.log).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Here is more
information on the directives which may be included in a
<b>logrotate</b> configuration file: <b><br>
compress</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Old versions of log files are
compressed with <b>gzip</b>(1) by default. See also
<b>nocompress</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>compresscmd</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specifies which command to use
to compress log files. The default is <b>gzip</b>. See also
<b>compress</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>uncompresscmd</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specifies which command to use
to uncompress log files. The default is <b>gunzip</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>compressext</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specifies which extension to
use on compressed logfiles, if compression is enabled. The
default follows that of the configured compression
command.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>compressoptions</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Command line options may be
passed to the compression program, if one is in use. The
default, for <b>gzip</b>(1), is &quot;&minus;6&quot; (biased
towards high compression at the expense of speed). If you
use a different compression command, you may need to change
the <b>compressoptions</b> to match.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="6%">


<p><b>copy</b></p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>Make a copy of the log file, but don&rsquo;t change the
original at all. This option can be used, for instance, to
make a snapshot of the current log file, or when some other
utility needs to truncate or parse the file. When this
option is used, the <b>create</b> option will have no
effect, as the old log file stays in place.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>copytruncate</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Truncate the original log file
in place after creating a copy, instead of moving the old
log file and optionally creating a new one. It can be used
when some program cannot be told to close its logfile and
thus might continue writing (appending) to the previous log
file forever. Note that there is a very small time slice
between copying the file and truncating it, so some logging
data might be lost. When this option is used, the
<b>create</b> option will have no effect, as the old log
file stays in place.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>create</b> <i>mode owner
group</i>, <b>create</b> <i>owner group</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Immediately after rotation
(before the <b>postrotate</b> script is run) the log file is
created (with the same name as the log file just rotated).
<i>mode</i> specifies the mode for the log file in octal
(the same as <b>chmod</b>(2)), <i>owner</i> specifies the
user name who will own the log file, and <i>group</i>
specifies the group the log file will belong to. Any of the
log file attributes may be omitted, in which case those
attributes for the new file will use the same values as the
original log file for the omitted attributes. This option
can be disabled using the <b>nocreate</b> option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>createolddir</b> <i>mode
owner group</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If the directory specified by
<b>olddir</b> directive does not exist, it is created.
<i>mode</i> specifies the mode for the <b>olddir</b>
directory in octal (the same as <b>chmod</b>(2)),
<i>owner</i> specifies the user name who will own the
<b>olddir</b> directory, and <i>group</i> specifies the
group the <b>olddir</b> directory will belong to. This
option can be disabled using the <b>nocreateolddir</b>
option.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="7%">


<p><b>daily</b></p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="49%">


<p>Log files are rotated every day.</p></td>
<td width="29%">
</td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>dateext</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Archive old versions of log
files adding a date extension like YYYYMMDD instead of
simply adding a number. The extension may be configured
using the <b>dateformat</b> and <b>dateyesterday</b>
options.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>dateformat</b>
<i>format_string</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specify the extension for
<b>dateext</b> using the notation similar to
<b>strftime</b>(3) function. Only %Y %m %d and %s specifiers
are allowed. The default value is &minus;%Y%m%d. Note that
also the character separating log name from the extension is
part of the dateformat string. The system clock must be set
past Sep 9th 2001 for %s to work correctly. Note that the
datestamps generated by this format must be lexically
sortable (i.e., first the year, then the month then the day.
e.g., 2001/12/01 is ok, but 01/12/2001 is not, since
01/11/2002 would sort lower while it is later). This is
because when using the <b>rotate</b> option, logrotate sorts
all rotated filenames to find out which logfiles are older
and should be removed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>dateyesterday</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Use yesterday&rsquo;s instead
of today&rsquo;s date to create the <b>dateext</b>
extension, so that the rotated log file has a date in its
name that is the same as the timestamps within it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>delaycompress</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Postpone compression of the
previous log file to the next rotation cycle. This only has
effect when used in combination with <b>compress</b>. It can
be used when some program cannot be told to close its
logfile and thus might continue writing to the previous log
file for some time.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>extension</b> <i>ext</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Log files with <i>ext</i>
extension can keep it after the rotation. If compression is
used, the compression extension (normally <b>.gz</b>)
appears after <i>ext</i>. For example you have a logfile
named mylog.foo and want to rotate it to mylog.1.foo.gz
instead of mylog.foo.1.gz.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="9%">


<p><b>hourly</b></p></td>
<td width="2%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>Log files are rotated every hour. Note that usually
<i>logrotate</i> is configured to be run by cron daily. You
have to change this configuration and run <i>logrotate</i>
hourly to be able to really rotate logs hourly.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>ifempty</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Rotate the log file even if it
is empty, overriding the <b>notifempty</b> option
(<b>ifempty</b> is the default).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>include</b>
<i>file_or_directory</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Reads the file given as an
argument as if it was included inline where the
<b>include</b> directive appears. If a directory is given,
most of the files in that directory are read in alphabetic
order before processing of the including file continues. The
only files which are ignored are files which are not regular
files (such as directories and named pipes) and files whose
names end with one of the taboo extensions, as specified by
the <b>tabooext</b> directive.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>mail</b> <i>address</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">When a log is rotated
out-of-existence, it is mailed to <i>address</i>. If no mail
should be generated by a particular log, the <b>nomail</b>
directive may be used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>mailfirst</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">When using the <b>mail</b>
command, mail the just-rotated file, instead of the
about-to-expire file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>maillast</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">When using the <b>mail</b>
command, mail the about-to-expire file, instead of the
just-rotated file (this is the default).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>maxage</b> <i>count</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Remove rotated logs older than
&lt;count&gt; days. The age is only checked if the logfile
is to be rotated. The files are mailed to the configured
address if <b>maillast</b> and <b>mail</b> are
configured.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>maxsize</b> <i>size</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Log files are rotated when they
grow bigger than <i>size</i> bytes even before the
additionally specified time interval (<b>daily</b>,
<b>weekly</b>, <b>monthly</b>, or <b>yearly</b>). The
related <b>size</b> option is similar except that it is
mutually exclusive with the time interval options, and it
causes log files to be rotated without regard for the last
rotation time. When <b>maxsize</b> is used, both the size
and timestamp of a log file are considered.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>minsize</b> <i>size</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Log files are rotated when they
grow bigger than <i>size</i> bytes, but not before the
additionally specified time interval (<b>daily</b>,
<b>weekly</b>, <b>monthly</b>, or <b>yearly</b>). The
related <b>size</b> option is similar except that it is
mutually exclusive with the time interval options, and it
causes log files to be rotated without regard for the last
rotation time. When <b>minsize</b> is used, both the size
and timestamp of a log file are considered.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>missingok</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If the log file is missing, go
on to the next one without issuing an error message. See
also <b>nomissingok</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>monthly</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Log files are rotated the first
time <b>logrotate</b> is run in a month (this is normally on
the first day of the month).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>nocompress</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Old versions of log files are
not compressed. See also <b>compress</b>.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">

<td width="9%">


<p><b>nocopy</b></p></td>

<td width="78%">


<p>Do not copy the original log file and leave it in place.
(this overrides the <b>copy</b> option).</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>nocopytruncate</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Do not truncate the original
log file in place after creating a copy (this overrides the
<b>copytruncate</b> option).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>nocreate</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">New log files are not created
(this overrides the <b>create</b> option).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>nocreateolddir</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>olddir</b> directory is not
created by logrotate when it does not exist.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>nodelaycompress</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Do not postpone compression of
the previous log file to the next rotation cycle (this
overrides the <b>delaycompress</b> option).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>nodateext</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Do not archive old versions of
log files with date extension (this overrides the
<b>dateext</b> option).</p>

<td width="61%">


<p>Don&rsquo;t mail old log files to any address.</p></td>
<td width="17%">
</td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>nomissingok</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If a log file does not exist,
issue an error. This is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>noolddir</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Logs are rotated in the same
directory the log normally resides in (this overrides the
<b>olddir</b> option).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>nosharedscripts</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Run <b>prerotate</b> and
<b>postrotate</b> scripts for every log file which is
rotated (this is the default, and overrides the
<b>sharedscripts</b> option). The absolute path to the log
file is passed as first argument to the script. If the
scripts exit with error, the remaining actions will not be
executed for the affected log only.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>noshred</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Do not use <b>shred</b> when
deleting old log files. See also <b>shred</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>notifempty</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Do not rotate the log if it is
empty (this overrides the <b>ifempty</b> option).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>olddir</b>
<i>directory</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Logs are moved into
<i>directory</i> for rotation. The <i>directory</i> must be
on the same physical device as the log file being rotated,
unless <b>copy</b>, <b>copytruncate</b> or <b>renamecopy</b>
option is used. The <i>directory</i> is assumed to be
relative to the directory holding the log file unless an
absolute path name is specified. When this option is used
all old versions of the log end up in <i>directory</i>. This
option may be overridden by the <b>noolddir</b> option.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>postrotate</b>/<b>endscript</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The lines between
<b>postrotate</b> and <b>endscript</b> (both of which must
appear on lines by themselves) are executed (using
<b>/bin/sh</b>) after the log file is rotated. These
directives may only appear inside a log file definition.
Normally, the absolute path to the log file is passed as
first argument to the script. If <b>sharedscripts</b> is
specified, whole pattern is passed to the script. See also
<b>prerotate</b>. See <b>sharedscripts</b> and
<b>nosharedscripts</b> for error handling.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>prerotate</b>/<b>endscript</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The lines between
<b>prerotate</b> and <b>endscript</b> (both of which must
appear on lines by themselves) are executed (using
<b>/bin/sh</b>) before the log file is rotated and only if
the log will actually be rotated. These directives may only
appear inside a log file definition. Normally, the absolute
path to the log file is passed as first argument to the
script. If <b>sharedscripts</b> is specified, whole pattern
is passed to the script. See also <b>postrotate</b>. See
<b>sharedscripts</b> and <b>nosharedscripts</b> for error
handling.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>firstaction</b>/<b>endscript</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The lines between
<b>firstaction</b> and <b>endscript</b> (both of which must
appear on lines by themselves) are executed (using
<b>/bin/sh</b>) once before all log files that match the
wildcarded pattern are rotated, before prerotate script is
run and only if at least one log will actually be rotated.
These directives may only appear inside a log file
definition. Whole pattern is passed to the script as first
argument. If the script exits with error, no further
processing is done. See also <b>lastaction</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>lastaction</b>/<b>endscript</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The lines between
<b>lastaction</b> and <b>endscript</b> (both of which must
appear on lines by themselves) are executed (using
<b>/bin/sh</b>) once after all log files that match the
wildcarded pattern are rotated, after postrotate script is
run and only if at least one log is rotated. These
directives may only appear inside a log file definition.
Whole pattern is passed to the script as first argument. If
the script exits with error, just an error message is shown
(as this is the last action). See also
<b>firstaction</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>preremove</b>/<b>endscript</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The lines between
<b>preremove</b> and <b>endscript</b> (both of which must
appear on lines by themselves) are executed (using
<b>/bin/sh</b>) once just before removal of a log file. The
logrotate will pass the name of file which is soon to be
removed. See also <b>firstaction</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>rotate</b> <i>count</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Log files are rotated
<i>count</i> times before being removed or mailed to the
address specified in a <b>mail</b> directive. If
<i>count</i> is 0, old versions are removed rather than
rotated.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>size</b> <i>size</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Log files are rotated only if
they grow bigger then <i>size</i> bytes. If <i>size</i> is
followed by <i>k</i>, the size is assumed to be in
kilobytes. If the <i>M</i> is used, the size is in
megabytes, and if <i>G</i> is used, the size is in
gigabytes. So <i>size 100</i>, <i>size 100k</i>, <i>size
100M</i> and <i>size 100G</i> are all valid.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>sharedscripts</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Normally, <b>prerotate</b> and
<b>postrotate</b> scripts are run for each log which is
rotated and the absolute path to the log file is passed as
first argument to the script. That means a single script may
be run multiple times for log file entries which match
multiple files (such as the <i>/var/log/news/*</i> example).
If <b>sharedscripts</b> is specified, the scripts are only
run once, no matter how many logs match the wildcarded
pattern, and whole pattern is passed to them. However, if
none of the logs in the pattern require rotating, the
scripts will not be run at all. If the scripts exit with
error, the remaining actions will not be executed for any
logs. This option overrides the <b>nosharedscripts</b>
option and implies <b>create</b> option.</p>

<p>Delete log files using <b>shred</b> &minus;u instead of
unlink(). This should ensure that logs are not readable
after their scheduled deletion; this is off by default. See
also <b>noshred</b>.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>shredcycles</b>
<i>count</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Asks GNU <b>shred</b>(1) to
overwrite log files <b>count</b> times before deletion.
Without this option, <b>shred</b>&rsquo;s default will be
used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>start</b> <i>count</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This is the number to use as
the base for rotation. For example, if you specify 0, the
logs will be created with a .0 extension as they are rotated
from the original log files. If you specify 9, log files
will be created with a .9, skipping 0-8. Files will still be
rotated the number of times specified with the <b>rotate</b>
directive.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>su</b> <i>user group</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Rotate log files set under this
user and group instead of using default user/group (usually
root). <i>user</i> specifies the user name used for rotation
and <i>group</i> specifies the group used for rotation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>tabooext</b> [+]
<i>list</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The current taboo extension
list is changed (see the <b>include</b> directive for
information on the taboo extensions). If a + precedes the
list of extensions, the current taboo extension list is
augmented, otherwise it is replaced. At startup, the taboo
extension list contains .rpmsave, .rpmorig, ~, .disabled,
.dpkg&minus;old, .dpkg&minus;dist, .dpkg&minus;new,
.cfsaved, .ucf&minus;old, .ucf&minus;dist, .ucf&minus;new,
.rpmnew, .swp, .cfsaved,

<p>Log files are rotated if the current weekday is less
