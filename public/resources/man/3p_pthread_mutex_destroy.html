<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>pthread_mutex_destroy</i>() function shall destroy the
mutex object referenced by <i>mutex</i>; the mutex object
becomes, in effect, uninitialized. An implementation may
cause <i>pthread_mutex_destroy</i>() to set the object
referenced by <i>mutex</i> to an invalid value. A destroyed
mutex object can be reinitialized using
<i>pthread_mutex_init</i>(); the results of otherwise
referencing the object after it has been destroyed are
undefined.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It shall be
safe to destroy an initialized mutex that is unlocked.
Attempting to destroy a locked mutex results in undefined
behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>pthread_mutex_init</i>() function shall initialize the
mutex referenced by <i>mutex</i> with attributes specified
by <i>attr</i>. If <i>attr</i> is NULL, the default mutex
attributes are used; the effect shall be the same as passing
the address of a default mutex attributes object. Upon
successful initialization, the state of the mutex becomes
initialized and unlocked.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Only
<i>mutex</i> itself may be used for performing
synchronization. The result of referring to copies of
<i>mutex</i> in calls to <i>pthread_mutex_lock</i>(),
<i>pthread_mutex_trylock</i>(),
<i>pthread_mutex_unlock</i>(), and
<i>pthread_mutex_destroy</i>() is undefined.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Attempting to
initialize an already initialized mutex results in undefined
behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In cases where
default mutex attributes are appropriate, the macro
PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER can be used to initialize mutexes
that are statically allocated. The effect shall be
equivalent to dynamic initialization by a call to
<i>pthread_mutex_init</i>() with parameter <i>attr</i>
specified as NULL, except that no error checks are
performed.</p>

<h2>RETURN VALUE
<a name="RETURN VALUE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If successful,
the <i>pthread_mutex_destroy</i>() and
<i>pthread_mutex_init</i>() functions shall return zero;
otherwise, an error number shall be returned to indicate the
error.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The [EBUSY] and
[EINVAL] error checks, if implemented, act as if they were
performed immediately at the beginning of processing for the
function and shall cause an error return prior to modifying
the state of the mutex specified by <i>mutex</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Alternate
Implementations Possible</b> <br>
This volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 supports
several alternative implementations of mutexes. An
implementation may store the lock directly in the object of
type <b>pthread_mutex_t</b>. Alternatively, an
implementation may store the lock in the heap and merely
store a pointer, handle, or unique ID in the mutex object.
Either implementation has advantages or may be required on
certain hardware configurations. So that portable code can
be written that is invariant to this choice, this volume of
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 does not define assignment or
equality for this type, and it uses the term
&quot;initialize&quot; to reinforce the (more restrictive)
notion that the lock may actually reside in the mutex object
itself.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that this
precludes an over-specification of the type of the mutex or
condition variable and motivates the opaqueness of the
type.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">An
implementation is permitted, but not required, to have
<i>pthread_mutex_destroy</i>() store an illegal value into
the mutex. This may help detect erroneous programs that try
to lock (or otherwise reference) a mutex that has already
been destroyed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Tradeoff
Between Error Checks and Performance Supported</b> <br>
Many of the error checks were made optional in order to let
implementations trade off performance <i>versus</i> degree
of error checking according to the needs of their specific
applications and execution environment. As a general rule,
errors or conditions caused by the system (such as
insufficient memory) always need to be reported, but errors
due to an erroneously coded application (such as failing to
provide adequate synchronization to prevent a mutex from
being deleted while in use) are made optional.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A wide range of
implementations is thus made possible. For example, an
implementation intended for application debugging may
implement all of the error checks, but an implementation
running a single, provably correct application under very
tight performance constraints in an embedded computer might
implement minimal checks. An implementation might even be
provided in two versions, similar to the options that
compilers provide: a full-checking, but slower version; and
a limited-checking, but faster version. To forbid this
optionality would be a disservice to users.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">By carefully
limiting the use of &quot;undefined behavior&quot; only to
things that an erroneous (badly coded) application might do,
and by defining that resource-not-available errors are
mandatory, this volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001
ensures that a fully-conforming application is portable
across the full range of implementations, while not forcing
all implementations to add overhead to check for numerous
things that a correct program never does.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Why No
Limits are Defined</b> <br>
Defining symbols for the maximum number of mutexes and
condition variables was considered but rejected because the
number of these objects may change dynamically. Furthermore,
many implementations place these objects into application
memory; thus, there is no explicit maximum.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Static
Initializers for Mutexes and Condition Variables</b> <br>
Providing for static initialization of statically allocated
synchronization objects allows modules with private static
synchronization variables to avoid runtime initialization
tests and overhead. Furthermore, it simplifies the coding of
self-initializing modules. Such modules are common in C
libraries, where for various reasons the design calls for
self-initialization instead of requiring an explicit module
initialization function to be called. An example use of
static initialization follows.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Without static
initialization, a self-initializing routine <i>foo</i>()
might look as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>static
pthread_once_t foo_once = PTHREAD_ONCE_INIT; <br>
static pthread_mutex_t foo_mutex;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>void
foo_init() <br>
{ <br>
pthread_mutex_init(&amp;foo_mutex, NULL); <br>
}</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>void foo()
<br>
{ <br>
pthread_once(&amp;foo_once, foo_init); <br>
pthread_mutex_lock(&amp;foo_mutex); <br>
/* Do work. */ <br>
pthread_mutex_unlock(&amp;foo_mutex); <br>
}</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">With static
initialization, the same routine could be coded as
follows:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>static
pthread_mutex_t foo_mutex =
PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>void foo()
<br>
{ <br>
pthread_mutex_lock(&amp;foo_mutex); <br>
/* Do work. */ <br>
pthread_mutex_unlock(&amp;foo_mutex); <br>
}</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that the
static initialization both eliminates the need for the
initialization test inside <i>pthread_once</i>() and the
fetch of &amp;<i>foo_mutex</i> to learn the address to be
passed to <i>pthread_mutex_lock</i>() or
<i>pthread_mutex_unlock</i>().</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Thus, the C
code written to initialize static objects is simpler on all
systems and is also faster on a large class of systems;
those where the (entire) synchronization object can be
stored in application memory.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Yet the locking
performance question is likely to be raised for machines
that require mutexes to be allocated out of special memory.
Such machines actually have to have mutexes and possibly
condition variables contain pointers to the actual hardware
locks. For static initialization to work on such machines,
<i>pthread_mutex_lock</i>() also has to test whether or not
the pointer to the actual lock has been allocated. If it has
not, <i>pthread_mutex_lock</i>() has to initialize it before
use. The reservation of such resources can be made when the
program is loaded, and hence return codes have not been
added to mutex locking and condition variable waiting to
indicate failure to complete initialization.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This runtime
test in <i>pthread_mutex_lock</i>() would at first seem to
be extra work; an extra test is required to see whether the
pointer has been initialized. On most machines this would
actually be implemented as a fetch of the pointer, testing
the pointer against zero, and then using the pointer if it
has already been initialized. While the test might seem to
add extra work, the extra effort of testing a register is
usually negligible since no extra memory references are
actually done. As more and more machines provide caches, the
real expenses are memory references, not instructions
executed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Alternatively,
depending on the machine architecture, there are often ways
to eliminate <i>all</i> overhead in the most important case:
on the lock operations that occur <i>after</i> the lock has
been initialized. This can be done by shifting more overhead
to the less frequent operation: initialization. Since
out-of-line mutex allocation also means that an address has
to be dereferenced to find the actual lock, one technique
that is widely applicable is to have static initialization
store a bogus value for that address; in particular, an
address that causes a machine fault to occur. When such a
fault occurs upon the first attempt to lock such a mutex,
validity checks can be done, and then the correct address
for the actual lock can be filled in. Subsequent lock
operations incur no extra overhead since they do not
&quot;fault&quot;. This is merely one technique that can be
used to support static initialization, while not adversely
affecting the performance of lock acquisition. No doubt
there are other techniques that are highly
machine-dependent.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The locking
overhead for machines doing out-of-line mutex allocation is
thus similar for modules being implicitly initialized, where
it is improved for those doing mutex allocation entirely
inline. The inline case is thus made much faster, and the
out-of-line case is not significantly worse.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Besides the
issue of locking performance for such machines, a concern is
raised that it is possible that threads would serialize
contending for initialization locks when attempting to
finish initializing statically allocated mutexes. (Such
finishing would typically involve taking an internal lock,
allocating a structure, storing a pointer to the structure
in the mutex, and releasing the internal lock.) First, many
implementations would reduce such serialization by hashing
on the mutex address. Second, such serialization can only
occur a bounded number of times. In particular, it can
happen at most as many times as there are statically
allocated synchronization objects. Dynamically allocated
objects would still be initialized via
<i>pthread_mutex_init</i>() or
<i>pthread_cond_init</i>().</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Finally, if
none of the above optimization techniques for out-of-line
allocation yields sufficient performance for an application
on some implementation, the application can avoid static
initialization altogether by explicitly initializing all
synchronization objects with the corresponding
<i>pthread_*_init</i>() functions, which are supported by
all implementations. An implementation can also document the
tradeoffs and advise which initialization technique is more
efficient for that particular implementation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Destroying
Mutexes</b> <br>
A mutex can be destroyed immediately after it is unlocked.
For example, consider the following code:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>struct obj {
<br>
pthread_mutex_t om; <br>
int refcnt; <br>
... <br>
};</b></p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>obj_done(struct
obj *op) <br>
{ <br>
pthread_mutex_lock(&amp;op-&gt;om); <br>
if (--op-&gt;refcnt == 0) { <br>
pthread_mutex_unlock(&amp;op-&gt;om); <br>
(A) pthread_mutex_destroy(&amp;op-&gt;om); <br>
(B) free(op); <br>
} else <br>
(C) pthread_mutex_unlock(&amp;op-&gt;om); <br>
}</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In this case
<i>obj</i> is reference counted and <i>obj_done</i>() is
called whenever a reference to the object is dropped.
Implementations are required to allow an object to be
destroyed and freed and potentially unmapped (for example,
lines A and B) immediately after the object is unlocked
(line C).</p>
