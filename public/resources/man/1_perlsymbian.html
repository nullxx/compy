<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">perlsymbian
&minus; Perl version 5 on Symbian OS</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This document
describes various features of the Symbian operating system
that will affect how Perl version 5 (hereafter just Perl) is
compiled and/or runs.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b><small>NOTE:</small>
this port (as of 0.4.1) does not compile into a Symbian
<small>OS GUI</small> application, but instead it results in
a Symbian <small>DLL</small> .</b> The <small>DLL</small>
includes a C <small>++</small> class called CPerlBase, which
one can then (derive from and) use to embed Perl into
applications, see <i>symbian/README</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The base port
of Perl to Symbian only implements the basic POSIX-like
functionality; it does not implement any further Symbian or
Series 60, Series 80, or <small>UIQ</small> bindings for
Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is also
possible to generate Symbian executables for
&quot;miniperl&quot; and &quot;perl&quot;, but since there
is no standard command line interface for Symbian (nor full
keyboards in the devices), these are useful mainly as
demonstrations.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Compiling
Perl on Symbian</b> <br>
(0) You need to have the appropriate Symbian
<small>SDK</small> installed.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    These instructions have been tested under various Nokia Series 60
    Symbian SDKs (1.2 to 2.6, 2.8 should also work, 1.2 compiles but
    does not work), Series 80 2.0, and Nokia 7710 (Series 90) SDK.
    You can get the SDKs from Forum Nokia (L&lt;http://www.forum.nokia.com/&gt;).
    A very rough port (&quot;it compiles&quot;) to UIQ 2.1 has also been made.
    A prerequisite for any of the SDKs is to install ActivePerl
    from ActiveState, L&lt;http://www.activestate.com/Products/ActivePerl/&gt;
    Having the SDK installed also means that you need to have either
    the Metrowerks CodeWarrior installed (2.8 and 3.0 were used in testing)
    or the Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 installed (SP3 minimum, SP5 recommended).
    Note that for example the Series 60 2.0 VC SDK installation talks
    about ActivePerl build 518, which does no more (as of mid&minus;2005) exist
    at the ActiveState website.  The ActivePerl 5.8.4 build 810 was
    used successfully for compiling Perl on Symbian.  The 5.6.x ActivePerls
    do not work.
    Other SDKs or compilers like Visual.NET, command&minus;line&minus;only
    Visual.NET, Borland, GnuPoc, or sdk2unix have not been tried.
    These instructions almost certainly won't work with older Symbian
    releases or other SDKs.  Patches to get this port running in other
    releases, SDKs, compilers, platforms, or devices are naturally welcome.</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">(1) Get a Perl
source code distribution (for example the file <br>
perl&minus;5.9.2.tar.gz is fine) from
&lt;http://www.cpan.org/src/&gt; <br>
and unpack it in your the C:/Symbian directory of your
Windows <br>
system.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">(2) Change to
the perl source directory.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">        cd c:\Symbian\perl&minus;5.x.x</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">(3) Run the
following script using the perl coming with the
<small>SDK</small></p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">        perl symbian\config.pl
    You must use the cmd.exe, the Cygwin shell will not work.
    The PATH must include the SDK tools, including a Perl,
    which should be the case under cmd.exe.  If you do not
    have that, see the end of symbian\sdk.pl for notes of
    how your environment should be set up for Symbian compiles.</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">(4) Build the
project, either by</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">        make all
    in cmd.exe or by using either the Metrowerks CodeWarrior
    or the Visual C++ 6.0, or the Visual Studio 8 (the Visual C++
    2005 Express Edition works fine).
    If you use the VC IDE, you will have to run F&lt;symbian\config.pl&gt;
    first using the cmd.exe, and then run 'make win.mf vc6.mf' to generate
    the VC6 makefiles and workspaces.  &quot;make vc6&quot; will compile for the VC6,
    and &quot;make cw&quot; for the CodeWarrior.
    The following SDK and compiler configurations and Nokia phones were
    tested at some point in time (+ = compiled and PerlApp run, &minus; = not),
    both for Perl 5.8.x and 5.9.x:
        SDK     | VC | CW |
        &minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;+&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;+&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;+&minus;&minus;&minus;
        S60 1.2 | +  | +  | 3650 (*)
        S60 2.0 | +  | +  | 6600
        S60 2.1 | &minus;  | +  | 6670
        S60 2.6 | +  | +  | 6630
        S60 2.8 | +  | +  | (not tested in a device)
        S80 2.6 | &minus;  | +  | 9300
        S90 1.1 | +  | &minus;  | 7710
        UIQ 2.1 | &minus;  | +  | (not tested in a device)
    (*) Compiles but does not work, unfortunately, a problem with Symbian.
    If you are using the 'make' directly, it is the GNU make from the SDKs,
    and it will invoke the right make commands for the Windows emulator
    build and the Arm target builds ('thumb' by default) as necessary.
    The build scripts assume the 'absolute style' SDK installs under C:,
    the 'subst style' will not work.
    If using the VC IDE, to build use for example the File&minus;&gt;Open Workspace&minus;&gt;
    C:\Symbian\8.0a\S60_2nd_FP2\epoc32\build\symbian\perl\perl\wins\perl.dsw
    The emulator binaries will appear in the same directory.
    If using the VC IDE, you will a lot of warnings in the beginning of
    the build because a lot of headers mentioned by the source cannot
    be found, but this is not serious since those headers are not used.
    The Metrowerks will give a lot of warnings about unused variables and
    empty declarations, you can ignore those.
    When the Windows and Arm DLLs are built do not be scared by a very long
    messages whizzing by: it is the &quot;export freeze&quot; phase where the whole
    (rather large) API of Perl is listed.
    Once the build is completed you need to create the DLL SIS file by
        make perldll.sis
    which will create the file perlXYZ.sis (the XYZ being the Perl version)
    which you can then install into your Symbian device: an easy way
    to do this is to send them via Bluetooth or infrared and just open
    the messages.
    Since the total size of all Perl SIS files once installed is
    over 2 MB, it is recommended to do the installation into a
    memory card (drive E:) instead of the C: drive.
    The size of the perlXYZ.SIS is about 370 kB but once it is in the
    device it is about one 750 kB (according to the application manager).
    The perlXYZ.sis includes only the Perl DLL: to create an additional
    SIS file which includes some of the standard (pure) Perl libraries,
    issue the command
        make perllib.sis
    Some of the standard Perl libraries are included, but not all:
    see L&lt;/HISTORY&gt; or F&lt;symbian\install.cfg&gt; for more details
    (250 kB &minus;&gt; 700 kB).
    Some of the standard Perl XS extensions (see L&lt;/HISTORY&gt; are
    also available:
        make perlext.sis
    which will create perlXYZext.sis (290 kB &minus;&gt; 770 kB).
    To compile the demonstration application PerlApp you need first to
    install the Perl headers under the SDK.
    To install the Perl headers and the class CPerlBase documentation
    so that you no more need the Perl sources around to compile Perl
    applications using the SDK:
        make sdkinstall
    The destination directory is C:\Symbian\perl\X.Y.Z.  For more
    details, see F&lt;symbian\PerlBase.pod&gt;.
    Once the headers have been installed, you can create a SIS for
    the PerlApp:
        make perlapp.sis
    The perlapp.sis (11 kB &minus;&gt; 16 kB) will be built in the symbian
    subdirectory, but a copy will also be made to the main directory.
    If you want to package the Perl DLLs (one for WINS, one for ARMI),
    the headers, and the documentation:
        make perlsdk.zip
    which will create perlXYZsdk.zip that can be used in another
    Windows system with the SDK, without having to compile Perl in
    that system.
    If you want to package the PerlApp sources:
        make perlapp.zip
    If you want to package the perl.exe and miniperl.exe, you
    can use the perlexe.sis and miniperlexe.sis make targets.
    You also probably want the perllib.sis for the libraries
    and maybe even the perlapp.sis for the recognizer.
    The make target 'allsis' combines all the above SIS targets.
    To clean up after compilation you can use either of
        make clean
        make distclean
    depending on how clean you want to be.</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Compilation
problems</b> <br>
If you see right after &quot;make&quot; this</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    cat makefile.sh &gt;makefile
    'cat' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
    operable program or batch file.</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">it means you
need to (re)run the <i>symbian\config.pl</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you get the
error</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">        'perl' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
        operable program or batch file.</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">you may need to
reinstall the ActivePerl.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you see
this</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    ren makedef.pl nomakedef.pl
    The system cannot find the file specified.
    C:\Symbian\...\make.exe: [rename_makedef] Error 1 (ignored)</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">please ignore
it since it is nothing serious (the build process of renames
the Perl makedef.pl as nomakedef.pl to avoid confusing it
with a makedef.pl of the <small>SDK</small> ).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>PerlApp</b>
<br>
The PerlApp application demonstrates how to embed Perl
interpreters to a Symbian application. The &quot;Time&quot;
menu item runs the following Perl code: <tt>&quot;print
&quot;Running in &quot;, $^O, &quot;\n&quot;, scalar
localtime&quot;</tt>, the &quot;Oneliner&quot; allows one to
type in Perl code, and the &quot;Run&quot; opens a file
chooser for selecting a Perl file to run.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The PerlApp
also is started when the &quot;Perl recognizer&quot; (also
included and installed) detects a Perl file being activated
through the <small>GUI</small> , and offers either to
install it under \Perl (if the Perl file is in the inbox of
the messaging application) or to run it (if the Perl file is
under \Perl).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>sisify.pl</b>
<br>
In the symbian subdirectory there is <i>sisify.pl</i>
utility which can be used to package Perl scripts and/or
Perl library directories into <small>SIS</small> files,
which can be installed to the device. To run the sisify.pl
utility, you will need to have the &rsquo;makesis&rsquo; and
&rsquo;uidcrc&rsquo; utilities already installed. If you
don&rsquo;t have the Win32 SDKs, you may try for example
&lt;http://gnupoc.sourceforge.net/&gt; or
&lt;http://symbianos.org/~andreh/&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Using Perl
in Symbian</b> <br>
First of all note that you have full access to the Symbian
device when using Perl: you can do a lot of damage to your
device (like removing system files) unless you are careful.
Please do take backups before doing anything.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The Perl port
has been done for the most part using the Symbian standard
POSIX-ish <small>STDLIB</small> library. It is a reasonably
complete library, but certain corners of such emulation
libraries that tend to be left unimplemented on non-UNIX
platforms have been left unimplemented also this time:
<i>fork()</i>, <i>signals()</i>, user/group ids,
<i>select()</i> working for sockets, non-blocking sockets,
and so forth. See the file <i>symbian/config.sh</i> and look
for &rsquo;undef&rsquo; to find the unsupported APIs (or
from Perl use Config).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The filesystem
of Symbian devices uses DOSish syntax, &quot;drives&quot;
separated from paths by a colon, and backslashes for the
path. The exact assignment of the drives probably varies
between platforms, but for example in Series 60 you might
see C: as the (flash) main memory, D: as the
<small>RAM</small> drive, E: as the memory card (
<small>MMC</small> ), Z: as the <small>ROM</small> . In
Series 80 D: is the memory card. As far the devices go the
<small>NUL:</small> is the bit bucket, the COMx: are the
serial lines, IRCOMx: are the <small>IR</small> ports,
<small>TMP:</small> might be C:\System\Temp. Remember to
double those backslashes in doublequoted strings.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The Perl
<small>DLL</small> is installed in \System\Libs\. The Perl
libraries and extension DLLs are installed in
\System\Libs\Perl\X.Y.Z\. The PerlApp is installed in
\System\Apps\, and the <small>SIS</small> also installs a
couple of demo scripts in \Perl\ (C:\Mydocs\Perl\ on Nokia
7710).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that the
Symbian filesystem is very picky: it strongly prefers the \
instead of the /.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When doing
<small>XS</small> / Symbian C <small>++</small> programming
include first the Symbian headers, then any standard C/POSIX
headers, then Perl headers, and finally any application
headers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>New()</i>
and <i>Copy()</i> are unfortunately used by both Symbian and
Perl code so you&rsquo;ll have to play cpp games if you need
them. PerlBase.h undefines the Perl definitions and
redefines them as <i>PerlNew()</i> and
<i>PerlCopy()</i>.</p>

<h2>TO DO
<a name="TO DO"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Lots. See
<i>symbian/TODO</i>.</p>

<h2>WARNING
<a name="WARNING"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As of Perl
Symbian port version 0.4.1 any part of Perl&rsquo;s standard
regression test suite has not been run on a real Symbian
device using the ported Perl, so innumerable bugs may lie in
wait. Therefore there is absolutely no warranty.</p>

<h2>NOTE

</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When creating
and extending application programming interfaces (APIs) for
Symbian or Series 60 or Series 80 or Series 90 it is
suggested that trademarks, registered trademarks, or trade
names are not used in the <small>API</small> names. Instead,
developers should consider basing the <small>API</small>
naming in the existing (C <small>++</small> , or maybe Java)
public component and <small>API</small> naming, modified as
appropriate by the rules of the programming language the new
APIs are for.</p>
