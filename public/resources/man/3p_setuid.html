<h2>RATIONALE
<a name="RATIONALE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The various
behaviors of the <i>setuid</i>() and <i>setgid</i>()
functions when called by non-privileged processes reflect
the behavior of different historical implementations. For
portability, it is recommended that new non-privileged
applications use the <i>seteuid</i>() and <i>setegid</i>()
functions instead.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The saved
set-user-ID capability allows a program to regain the
effective user ID established at the last <i>exec</i> call.
Similarly, the saved set-group-ID capability allows a
program to regain the effective group ID established at the
last <i>exec</i> call. These capabilities are derived from
System V. Without them, a program might have to run as
superuser in order to perform the same functions, because
superuser can write on the user&rsquo;s files. This is a
problem because such a program can write on any user&rsquo;s
files, and so must be carefully written to emulate the
permissions of the calling process properly. In System V,
these capabilities have traditionally been implemented only
via the <i>setuid</i>() and <i>setgid</i>() functions for
non-privileged processes. The fact that the behavior of
those functions was different for privileged processes made
them difficult to use. The POSIX.1-1990 standard defined the
<i>setuid</i>() function to behave differently for
privileged and unprivileged users. When the caller had the
appropriate privilege, the function set the calling
process&rsquo; real user ID, effective user ID, and saved
set-user ID on implementations that supported it. When the
caller did not have the appropriate privilege, the function
set only the effective user ID, subject to permission
checks. The former use is generally needed for utilities
like <i>login</i> and <i>su</i>, which are not conforming
applications and thus outside the scope of
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001. These utilities wish to
change the user ID irrevocably to a new value, generally
that of an unprivileged user. The latter use is needed for
conforming applications that are installed with the
set-user-ID bit and need to perform operations using the
real user ID.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001
augments the latter functionality with a mandatory feature
named _POSIX_SAVED_IDS. This feature permits a set-user-ID
application to switch its effective user ID back and forth
between the values of its <i>exec</i>-time real user ID and
effective user ID. Unfortunately, the POSIX.1-1990 standard
did not permit a conforming application using this feature
to work properly when it happened to be executed with the
(implementation-defined) appropriate privilege. Furthermore,
the application did not even have a means to tell whether it
had this privilege. Since the saved set-user-ID feature is
quite desirable for applications, as evidenced by the fact
that NIST required it in FIPS 151-2, it has been mandated by
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001. However, there are
implementors who have been reluctant to support it given the
limitation described above.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The 4.3BSD
system handles the problem by supporting separate functions:
<i>setuid</i>() (which always sets both the real and
effective user IDs, like <i>setuid</i>() in
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 for privileged users), and
<i>seteuid</i>() (which always sets just the effective user
ID, like <i>setuid</i>() in IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001
for non-privileged users). This separation of functionality
into distinct functions seems desirable. 4.3BSD does not
support the saved set-user-ID feature. It supports similar
functionality of switching the effective user ID back and
forth via <i>setreuid</i>(), which permits reversing the
real and effective user IDs. This model seems less desirable
than the saved set-user-ID because the real user ID changes
as a side effect. The current 4.4BSD includes saved
effective IDs and uses them for <i>seteuid</i>() and
<i>setegid</i>() as described above. The <i>setreuid</i>()
and <i>setregid</i>() functions will be deprecated or
removed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The solution
here is:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="12%"></td>
<td width="2%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">*</p></td>
<td width="1%"></td>
<td width="85%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">Require that all implementations
support the functionality of the saved set-user-ID, which is
set by the <i>exec</i> functions and by privileged calls to
<i>setuid</i>().</p> </td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="12%"></td>
<td width="2%">


<p>*</p></td>
<td width="1%"></td>
<td width="85%">


<p>Add the <i>seteuid</i>() and <i>setegid</i>() functions
as portable alternatives to <i>setuid</i>() and
<i>setgid</i>() for non-privileged and privileged
processes.</p> </td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Historical
systems have provided two mechanisms for a set-user-ID
process to change its effective user ID to be the same as
its real user ID in such a way that it could return to the
original effective user ID: the use of the <i>setuid</i>()
function in the presence of a saved set-user-ID, or the use
of the BSD <i>setreuid</i>() function, which was able to
swap the real and effective user IDs. The changes included
in IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 provide a new mechanism
using <i>seteuid</i>() in conjunction with a saved
set-user-ID. Thus, all implementations with the new
<i>seteuid</i>() mechanism will have a saved set-user-ID for
each process, and most of the behavior controlled by
_POSIX_SAVED_IDS has been changed to agree with the case
where the option was defined. The <i>kill</i>() function is
an exception. Implementors of the new <i>seteuid</i>()
mechanism will generally be required to maintain
compatibility with the older mechanisms previously supported
by their systems. However, compatibility with this use of
<i>setreuid</i>() and with the _POSIX_SAVED_IDS behavior of
<i>kill</i>() is unfortunately complicated. If an
implementation with a saved set-user-ID allows a process to
use <i>setreuid</i>() to swap its real and effective user
IDs, but were to leave the saved set-user-ID unmodified, the
process would then have an effective user ID equal to the
original real user ID, and both real and saved set-user-ID
would be equal to the original effective user ID. In that
state, the real user would be unable to kill the process,
even though the effective user ID of the process matches
that of the real user, if the <i>kill</i>() behavior of
_POSIX_SAVED_IDS was used. This is obviously not acceptable.
The alternative choice, which is used in at least one
implementation, is to change the saved set-user-ID to the
effective user ID during most calls to <i>setreuid</i>().
The standard developers considered that alternative to be
less correct than the retention of the old behavior of
<i>kill</i>() in such systems. Current conforming
applications shall accommodate either behavior from
<i>kill</i>(), and there appears to be no strong reason for
<i>kill</i>() to check the saved set-user-ID rather than the
effective user ID.</p>
