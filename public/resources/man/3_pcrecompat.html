<h2>DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PCRE AND PERL
<a name="DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PCRE AND PERL"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This document
describes the differences in the ways that PCRE and Perl
handle regular expressions. The differences described here
are with respect to Perl versions 5.10 and above.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">1. PCRE has
only a subset of Perl&rsquo;s Unicode support. Details of
what it does have are given in the <b>pcreunicode</b>
page.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">2. PCRE allows
repeat quantifiers only on parenthesized assertions, but
they do not mean what you might think. For example, (?!a){3}
does not assert that the next three characters are not
&quot;a&quot;. It just asserts that the next character is
not &quot;a&quot; three times (in principle: PCRE optimizes
this to run the assertion just once). Perl allows repeat
quantifiers on other assertions such as \b, but these do not
seem to have any use.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">3. Capturing
subpatterns that occur inside negative lookahead assertions
are counted, but their entries in the offsets vector are
never set. Perl sets its numerical variables from any such
patterns that are matched before the assertion fails to
match something (thereby succeeding), but only if the
negative lookahead assertion contains just one branch.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">4. Though
binary zero characters are supported in the subject string,
they are not allowed in a pattern string because it is
passed as a normal C string, terminated by zero. The escape
sequence \0 can be used in the pattern to represent a binary
zero.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">5. The
following Perl escape sequences are not supported: \l, \u,
\L, \U, and \N when followed by a character name or Unicode
value. (\N on its own, matching a non-newline character, is
supported.) In fact these are implemented by Perl&rsquo;s
general string-handling and are not part of its pattern
matching engine. If any of these are encountered by PCRE, an
error is generated by default. However, if the
PCRE_JAVASCRIPT_COMPAT option is set, \U and \u are
interpreted as JavaScript interprets them.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">6. The Perl
escape sequences \p, \P, and \X are supported only if PCRE
is built with Unicode character property support. The
properties that can be tested with \p and \P are limited to
the general category properties such as Lu and Nd, script
names such as Greek or Han, and the derived properties Any
and L&amp;. PCRE does support the Cs (surrogate) property,
which Perl does not; the Perl documentation says
&quot;Because Perl hides the need for the user to understand
the internal representation of Unicode characters, there is
no need to implement the somewhat messy concept of
surrogates.&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">7. PCRE does
support the \Q...\E escape for quoting substrings.
Characters in between are treated as literals. This is
slightly different from Perl in that $ and @ are also
handled as literals inside the quotes. In Perl, they cause
variable interpolation (but of course PCRE does not have
variables). Note the following examples:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Pattern PCRE
matches Perl matches</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">\Qabc$xyz\E
abc$xyz abc followed by the <br>
contents of $xyz <br>
\Qabc\$xyz\E abc\$xyz abc\$xyz <br>
\Qabc\E\$\Qxyz\E abc$xyz abc$xyz</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The \Q...\E
sequence is recognized both inside and outside character
classes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">8. Fairly
obviously, PCRE does not support the (?{code}) and
(??{code}) constructions. However, there is support for
recursive patterns. This is not available in Perl 5.8, but
it is in Perl 5.10. Also, the PCRE &quot;callout&quot;
feature allows an external function to be called during
pattern matching. See the <b>pcrecallout</b> documentation
for details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">9. Subpatterns
that are called as subroutines (whether or not recursively)
are always treated as atomic groups in PCRE. This is like
Python, but unlike Perl. Captured values that are set
outside a subroutine call can be reference from inside in
PCRE, but not in Perl. There is a discussion that explains
these differences in more detail in the section on recursion
differences from Perl in the <b>pcrepattern</b> page.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">10. If any of
the backtracking control verbs are used in an assertion or
in a subpattern that is called as a subroutine (whether or
not recursively), their effect is confined to that
subpattern; it does not extend to the surrounding pattern.
This is not always the case in Perl. In particular, if
(*THEN) is present in a group that is called as a
subroutine, its action is limited to that group, even if the
group does not contain any | characters. There is one
exception to this: the name from a *(MARK), (*PRUNE), or
(*THEN) that is encountered in a successful positive
assertion <i>is</i> passed back when a match succeeds
(compare capturing parentheses in assertions). Note that
such subpatterns are processed as anchored at the point
where they are tested.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">11. There are
some differences that are concerned with the settings of
captured strings when part of a pattern is repeated. For
example, matching &quot;aba&quot; against the pattern
/^(a(b)?)+$/ in Perl leaves $2 unset, but in PCRE it is set
to &quot;b&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">12.
PCRE&rsquo;s handling of duplicate subpattern numbers and
duplicate subpattern names is not as general as
Perl&rsquo;s. This is a consequence of the fact the PCRE
works internally just with numbers, using an external table
to translate between numbers and names. In particular, a
pattern such as (?|(?&lt;a&gt;A)|(?&lt;b)B), where the two
capturing parentheses have the same number but different
names, is not supported, and causes an error at compile
time. If it were allowed, it would not be possible to
distinguish which parentheses matched, because both names
map to capturing subpattern number 1. To avoid this
confusing situation, an error is given at compile time.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">13. Perl
recognizes comments in some places that PCRE does not, for
example, between the ( and ? at the start of a subpattern.
If the /x modifier is set, Perl allows white space between (
and ? but PCRE never does, even if the PCRE_EXTENDED option
is set.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">14. PCRE
provides some extensions to the Perl regular expression
facilities. Perl 5.10 includes new features that are not in
earlier versions of Perl, some of which (such as named
parentheses) have been in PCRE for some time. This list is
with respect to Perl 5.10:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">(a) Although
lookbehind assertions in PCRE must match fixed length
strings, each alternative branch of a lookbehind assertion
can match a different length of string. Perl requires them
all to have the same length.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">(b) If
PCRE_DOLLAR_ENDONLY is set and PCRE_MULTILINE is not set,
the $ meta-character matches only at the very end of the
string.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">(c) If
PCRE_EXTRA is set, a backslash followed by a letter with no
special meaning is faulted. Otherwise, like Perl, the
backslash is quietly ignored. (Perl can be made to issue a
warning.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">(d) If
PCRE_UNGREEDY is set, the greediness of the repetition
quantifiers is inverted, that is, by default they are not
greedy, but if followed by a question mark they are.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">(e)
PCRE_ANCHORED can be used at matching time to force a
pattern to be tried only at the first matching position in
the subject string.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">(f) The
PCRE_NOTBOL, PCRE_NOTEOL, PCRE_NOTEMPTY,
PCRE_NOTEMPTY_ATSTART, and PCRE_NO_AUTO_CAPTURE options for
<b>pcre_exec()</b> have no Perl equivalents.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">(g) The \R
escape sequence can be restricted to match only CR, LF, or
CRLF by the PCRE_BSR_ANYCRLF option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">(h) The callout
facility is PCRE-specific.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">(i) The partial
matching facility is PCRE-specific.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">(j) Patterns
compiled by PCRE can be saved and re-used at a later time,
even on different hosts that have the other endianness.
However, this does not apply to optimized data created by
the just-in-time compiler.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">(k) The
alternative matching functions (<b>pcre_dfa_exec()</b>,
<b>pcre16_dfa_exec()</b> and <b>pcre32_dfa_exec()</b>,)
match in a different way and are not Perl-compatible.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">(l) PCRE
recognizes some special sequences such as (*CR) at the start
of a pattern that set overall options that cannot be changed
within the pattern.</p>
