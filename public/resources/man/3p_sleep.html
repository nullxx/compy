</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>#include

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>unsigned

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>sleep</i>() function shall cause the calling thread to be
suspended from execution until either the number of realtime
seconds specified by the argument <i>seconds</i> has elapsed
or a signal is delivered to the calling thread and its
action is to invoke a signal-catching function or to
terminate the process. The suspension time may be longer
than requested due to the scheduling of other activity by
the system.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If a SIGALRM
signal is generated for the calling process during execution
of <i>sleep</i>() and if the SIGALRM signal is being ignored
or blocked from delivery, it is unspecified whether
<i>sleep</i>() returns when the SIGALRM signal is scheduled.
If the signal is being blocked, it is also unspecified
whether it remains pending after <i>sleep</i>() returns or
it is discarded.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If a SIGALRM
signal is generated for the calling process during execution
of <i>sleep</i>(), except as a result of a prior call to
<i>alarm</i>(), and if the SIGALRM signal is not being
ignored or blocked from delivery, it is unspecified whether
that signal has any effect other than causing <i>sleep</i>()
to return.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If a
signal-catching function interrupts <i>sleep</i>() and
examines or changes either the time a SIGALRM is scheduled
to be generated, the action associated with the SIGALRM
signal, or whether the SIGALRM signal is blocked from
delivery, the results are unspecified.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If a
signal-catching function interrupts <i>sleep</i>() and calls
<i>siglongjmp</i>() or <i>longjmp</i>() to restore an
environment saved prior to the <i>sleep</i>() call, the
action associated with the SIGALRM signal and the time at
which a SIGALRM signal is scheduled to be generated are
unspecified. It is also unspecified whether the SIGALRM
signal is blocked, unless the process&rsquo; signal mask is
restored as part of the environment.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Interactions
between <i>sleep</i>() and any of <i>setitimer</i>(),
<i>ualarm</i>(), or <i>usleep</i>() are unspecified.</p>

<h2>RETURN VALUE
<a name="RETURN VALUE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If
<i>sleep</i>() returns because the requested time has
elapsed, the value returned shall be 0. If <i>sleep</i>()
returns due to delivery of a signal, the return value shall
be the &quot;unslept&quot; amount (the requested time minus
the time actually slept) in seconds.</p>

<h2>RATIONALE
<a name="RATIONALE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There are two
general approaches to the implementation of the
<i>sleep</i>() function. One is to use the <i>alarm</i>()
function to schedule a SIGALRM signal and then suspend the
process waiting for that signal. The other is to implement
an independent facility. This volume of
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 permits either approach.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In order to
comply with the requirement that no primitive shall change a
process attribute unless explicitly described by this volume
of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001, an implementation using
SIGALRM must carefully take into account any SIGALRM signal
scheduled by previous <i>alarm</i>() calls, the action
previously established for SIGALRM, and whether SIGALRM was
blocked. If a SIGALRM has been scheduled before the
<i>sleep</i>() would ordinarily complete, the <i>sleep</i>()
must be shortened to that time and a SIGALRM generated
(possibly simulated by direct invocation of the
signal-catching function) before <i>sleep</i>() returns. If
a SIGALRM has been scheduled after the <i>sleep</i>() would
ordinarily complete, it must be rescheduled for the same
time before <i>sleep</i>() returns. The action and blocking
for SIGALRM must be saved and restored.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Historical
implementations often implement the SIGALRM-based version
using <i>alarm</i>() and <i>pause</i>(). One such
implementation is prone to infinite hangups, as described in
<i>pause</i>(). Another such implementation uses the
C-language <i>setjmp</i>() and <i>longjmp</i>() functions to
avoid that window. That implementation introduces a
different problem: when the SIGALRM signal interrupts a
signal-catching function installed by the user to catch a
different signal, the <i>longjmp</i>() aborts that
signal-catching function. An implementation based on
<i>sigprocmask</i>(), <i>alarm</i>(), and
<i>sigsuspend</i>() can avoid these problems.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Despite all
reasonable care, there are several very subtle, but
detectable and unavoidable, differences between the two
types of implementations. These are the cases mentioned in
this volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 where some
other activity relating to SIGALRM takes place, and the
results are stated to be unspecified. All of these cases are
sufficiently unusual as not to be of concern to most
applications.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">See also the
discussion of the term <i>realtime</i> in <i>alarm</i>()
.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Since
<i>sleep</i>() can be implemented using <i>alarm</i>(), the
discussion about alarms occurring early under <i>alarm</i>()
applies to <i>sleep</i>() as well.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Application
writers should note that the type of the argument
<i>seconds</i> and the return value of <i>sleep</i>() is
<b>unsigned</b>. That means that a Strictly Conforming POSIX
System Interfaces Application cannot pass a value greater
than the minimum guaranteed value for {UINT_MAX}, which the
ISO&nbsp;C standard sets as 65535, and any application
passing a larger value is restricting its portability. A
different type was considered, but historical
implementations, including those with a 16-bit <b>int</b>
type, consistently use either <b>unsigned</b> or
<b>int</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Scheduling
delays may cause the process to return from the
<i>sleep</i>() function significantly after the requested
time. In such cases, the return value should be set to zero,
since the formula (requested time minus the time actually
spent) yields a negative number and <i>sleep</i>() returns
an <b>unsigned</b>.</p>
