<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">perlipc &minus;
Perl interprocess communication (signals, fifos, pipes, safe
subprocesses, sockets, and semaphores)</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The basic
<small>IPC</small> facilities of Perl are built out of the
good old Unix signals, named pipes, pipe opens, the Berkeley
socket routines, and SysV <small>IPC</small> calls. Each is
used in slightly different situations.</p>

<h2>Signals
<a name="Signals"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Perl uses a
simple signal handling model: the <tt>%SIG</tt> hash
contains names or references of user-installed signal
handlers. These handlers will be called with an argument
which is the name of the signal that triggered it. A signal
may be generated intentionally from a particular keyboard
sequence like control-C or control-Z, sent to you from
another process, or triggered automatically by the kernel
when special events transpire, like a child process exiting,
your own process running out of stack space, or hitting a
process file-size limit.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For example, to
trap an interrupt signal, set up a handler like this:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    our $shucks;
    sub catch_zap {
        my $signame = shift;
        $shucks++;
        die &quot;Somebody sent me a SIG$signame&quot;;
    }
    $SIG{INT} = __PACKAGE__ . &quot;::catch_zap&quot;;
    $SIG{INT} = \&amp;catch_zap;  # best strategy</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Prior to Perl
5.7.3 it was necessary to do as little as you possibly could
in your handler; notice how all we do is set a global
variable and then raise an exception. That&rsquo;s because
on most systems, libraries are not re-entrant; particularly,
memory allocation and I/O routines are not. That meant that
doing nearly <i>anything</i> in your handler could in theory
trigger a memory fault and subsequent core dump &minus; see
&quot;Deferred Signals (Safe Signals)&quot; below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The names of
the signals are the ones listed out by <tt>&quot;kill
&minus;l&quot;</tt> on your system, or you can retrieve them
using the <small>CPAN</small> module IPC::Signal.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You may also
choose to assign the strings <tt>&quot;IGNORE&quot;</tt> or
<tt>&quot;DEFAULT&quot;</tt> as the handler, in which case
Perl will try to discard the signal or do the default
thing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On most Unix
platforms, the <tt>&quot;CHLD&quot;</tt> (sometimes also
known as <tt>&quot;CLD&quot;</tt>) signal has special
behavior with respect to a value of
<tt>&quot;IGNORE&quot;</tt>. Setting <tt>$SIG{CHLD}</tt> to
<tt>&quot;IGNORE&quot;</tt> on such a platform has the
effect of not creating zombie processes when the parent
process fails to <tt>&quot;wait()&quot;</tt> on its child
processes (i.e., child processes are automatically reaped).
Calling <tt>&quot;wait()&quot;</tt> with <tt>$SIG{CHLD}</tt>
set to <tt>&quot;IGNORE&quot;</tt> usually returns
<tt>&quot;&minus;1&quot;</tt> on such platforms.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Some signals
can be neither trapped nor ignored, such as the
<small>KILL</small> and <small>STOP</small> (but not the
<small>TSTP</small> ) signals. Note that ignoring signals
makes them disappear. If you only want them blocked
temporarily without them getting lost you&rsquo;ll have to
use <small>POSIX</small> &rsquo; sigprocmask.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Sending a
signal to a negative process <small>ID</small> means that
you send the signal to the entire Unix process group. This
code sends a hang-up signal to all processes in the current
process group, and also sets <tt>$SIG</tt>{
<small>HUP</small> } to <tt>&quot;IGNORE&quot;</tt> so it
doesn&rsquo;t kill itself:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    # block scope for local
    {
        local $SIG{HUP} = &quot;IGNORE&quot;;
        kill HUP =&gt; &minus;$$;
        # snazzy writing of: kill(&quot;HUP&quot;, &minus;$$)
    }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Another
interesting signal to send is signal number zero. This
doesn&rsquo;t actually affect a child process, but instead
checks whether it&rsquo;s alive or has changed its UIDs.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    unless (kill 0 =&gt; $kid_pid) {
        warn &quot;something wicked happened to $kid_pid&quot;;
    }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Signal number
zero may fail because you lack permission to send the signal
when directed at a process whose real or saved
<small>UID</small> is not identical to the real or effective
<small>UID</small> of the sending process, even though the
process is alive. You may be able to determine the cause of
failure using <tt>$!</tt> or <tt>&quot;%!&quot;</tt>.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    unless (kill(0 =&gt; $pid) || $!{EPERM}) {
        warn &quot;$pid looks dead&quot;;
    }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You might also
want to employ anonymous functions for simple signal
handlers:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    $SIG{INT} = sub { die &quot;\nOutta here!\n&quot; };</pre>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><small>SIGCHLD</small>
handlers require some special care. If a second child dies
while in the signal handler caused by the first death, we
won&rsquo;t get another signal. So must loop here else we
will leave the unreaped child as a zombie. And the next time
two children die we get another zombie. And so on.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    use POSIX &quot;:sys_wait_h&quot;;
    $SIG{CHLD} = sub {
        while ((my $child = waitpid(&minus;1, WNOHANG)) &gt; 0) {
            $Kid_Status{$child} = $?;
        }
    };
    # do something that forks...</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Be careful:
<i>qx()</i>, <i>system()</i>, and some modules for calling
external commands do a <i>fork()</i>, then <i>wait()</i> for
the result. Thus, your signal handler will be called.
Because <i>wait()</i> was already called by <i>system()</i>
or <i>qx()</i>, the <i>wait()</i> in the signal handler will
see no more zombies and will therefore block.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The best way to
prevent this issue is to use <i>waitpid()</i>, as in the
following example:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    use POSIX &quot;:sys_wait_h&quot;; # for nonblocking read
    my %children;
    $SIG{CHLD} = sub {
        # don't change $! and $? outside handler
        local ($!, $?);
        my $pid = waitpid(&minus;1, WNOHANG);
        return if $pid == &minus;1;
        return unless defined $children{$pid};
        delete $children{$pid};
        cleanup_child($pid, $?);
    };
    while (1) {
        my $pid = fork();
        die &quot;cannot fork&quot; unless defined $pid;
        if ($pid == 0) {
            # ...
            exit 0;
        } else {
            $children{$pid}=1;
            # ...
            system($command);
            # ...
       }
    }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Signal handling
is also used for timeouts in Unix. While safely protected
within an <tt>&quot;eval{}&quot;</tt> block, you set a
signal handler to trap alarm signals and then schedule to
have one delivered to you in some number of seconds. Then
try your blocking operation, clearing the alarm when
it&rsquo;s done but not before you&rsquo;ve exited your
<tt>&quot;eval{}&quot;</tt> block. If it goes off,
you&rsquo;ll use <i>die()</i> to jump out of the block.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Here&rsquo;s an
example:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    my $ALARM_EXCEPTION = &quot;alarm clock restart&quot;;
    eval {
        local $SIG{ALRM} = sub { die $ALARM_EXCEPTION };
        alarm 10;
        flock(FH, 2)    # blocking write lock
                        || die &quot;cannot flock: $!&quot;;
        alarm 0;
    };
    if ($@ &amp;&amp; $@ !~ quotemeta($ALARM_EXCEPTION)) { die }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the
operation being timed out is <i>system()</i> or <i>qx()</i>,
this technique is liable to generate zombies. If this
matters to you, you&rsquo;ll need to do your own
<i>fork()</i> and <i>exec()</i>, and kill the errant child
process.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For more
complex signal handling, you might see the standard
<small>POSIX</small> module. Lamentably, this is almost
entirely undocumented, but the <i>t/lib/posix.t</i> file
from the Perl source distribution has some examples in
it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Handling the
<small>SIGHUP</small> Signal in Daemons</b> <br>
A process that usually starts when the system boots and
shuts down when the system is shut down is called a daemon
(Disk And Execution MONitor). If a daemon process has a
configuration file which is modified after the process has
been started, there should be a way to tell that process to
reread its configuration file without stopping the process.
Many daemons provide this mechanism using a
<tt>&quot;SIGHUP&quot;</tt> signal handler. When you want to
tell the daemon to reread the file, simply send it the
<tt>&quot;SIGHUP&quot;</tt> signal.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
example implements a simple daemon, which restarts itself
every time the <tt>&quot;SIGHUP&quot;</tt> signal is
received. The actual code is located in the subroutine
<tt>&quot;code()&quot;</tt>, which just prints some
debugging info to show that it works; it should be replaced
with the real code.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  #!/usr/bin/perl &minus;w
  use POSIX ();
  use FindBin ();
  use File::Basename ();
  use File::Spec::Functions;
  $| = 1;
  # make the daemon cross&minus;platform, so exec always calls the script
  # itself with the right path, no matter how the script was invoked.
  my $script = File::Basename::basename($0);
  my $SELF  = catfile($FindBin::Bin, $script);
  # POSIX unmasks the sigprocmask properly
  $SIG{HUP} = sub {
      print &quot;got SIGHUP\n&quot;;
      exec($SELF, @ARGV)        || die &quot;$0: couldn't restart: $!&quot;;
  };
  code();
  sub code {
      print &quot;PID: $$\n&quot;;
      print &quot;ARGV: @ARGV\n&quot;;
      my $count = 0;
      while (++$count) {
          sleep 2;
          print &quot;$count\n&quot;;
      }
  }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Deferred
Signals (Safe Signals)</b> <br>
Before Perl 5.7.3, installing Perl code to deal with signals
exposed you to danger from two things. First, few system
library functions are re-entrant. If the signal interrupts
while Perl is executing one function (like <i>malloc</i>(3)
or <i>printf</i>(3)), and your signal handler then calls the
same function again, you could get unpredictable
behavior--often, a core dump. Second, Perl isn&rsquo;t
itself re-entrant at the lowest levels. If the signal
interrupts Perl while Perl is changing its own internal data
structures, similarly unpredictable behavior may result.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There were two
things you could do, knowing this: be paranoid or be
pragmatic. The paranoid approach was to do as little as
possible in your signal handler. Set an existing integer
variable that already has a value, and return. This
doesn&rsquo;t help you if you&rsquo;re in a slow system
call, which will just restart. That means you have to
<tt>&quot;die&quot;</tt> to <i>longjmp</i>(3) out of the
handler. Even this is a little cavalier for the true
paranoiac, who avoids <tt>&quot;die&quot;</tt> in a handler
because the system <i>is</i> out to get you. The pragmatic
approach was to say &quot;I know the risks, but prefer the
convenience&quot;, and to do anything you wanted in your
signal handler, and be prepared to clean up core dumps now
and again.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Perl 5.7.3 and
later avoid these problems by &quot;deferring&quot; signals.
That is, when the signal is delivered to the process by the
system (to the C code that implements Perl) a flag is set,
and the handler returns immediately. Then at strategic
&quot;safe&quot; points in the Perl interpreter (e.g. when
it is about to execute a new opcode) the flags are checked
and the Perl level handler from <tt>%SIG</tt> is executed.
The &quot;deferred&quot; scheme allows much more flexibility
in the coding of signal handlers as we know the Perl
interpreter is in a safe state, and that we are not in a
system library function when the handler is called. However
the implementation does differ from previous Perls in the
following ways: <br>
Long-running opcodes</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">As the Perl interpreter looks
at signal flags only when it is about to execute a new
opcode, a signal that arrives during a long-running opcode
(e.g. a regular expression operation on a very large string)
will not be seen until the current opcode completes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If a signal of
any given type fires multiple times during an opcode (such
as from a fine-grained timer), the handler for that signal
will be called only once, after the opcode completes; all
other instances will be discarded. Furthermore, if your
system&rsquo;s signal queue gets flooded to the point that
there are signals that have been raised but not yet caught
(and thus not deferred) at the time an opcode completes,
those signals may well be caught and deferred during
subsequent opcodes, with sometimes surprising results. For
example, you may see alarms delivered even after calling
<tt>alarm(0)</tt> as the latter stops the raising of alarms
but does not cancel the delivery of alarms raised but not
yet caught. Do not depend on the behaviors described in this
paragraph as they are side effects of the current
implementation and may change in future versions of
Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Interrupting
<small>IO</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When a signal is delivered
(e.g., <small>SIGINT</small> from a control-C) the operating
system breaks into <small>IO</small> operations like
<i>read</i>(2), which is used to implement Perl&rsquo;s
<i>readline()</i> function, the
<tt>&quot;&lt;&gt;&quot;</tt> operator. On older Perls the
handler was called immediately (and as
<tt>&quot;read&quot;</tt> is not &quot;unsafe&quot;, this
worked well). With the &quot;deferred&quot; scheme the
handler is <i>not</i> called immediately, and if Perl is
using the system&rsquo;s <tt>&quot;stdio&quot;</tt> library
that library may restart the <tt>&quot;read&quot;</tt>
without returning to Perl to give it a chance to call the
<tt>%SIG</tt> handler. If this happens on your system the
solution is to use the <tt>&quot;:perlio&quot;</tt> layer to
do IO--at least on those handles that you want to be able to
break into with signals. (The <tt>&quot;:perlio&quot;</tt>
layer checks the signal flags and calls <tt>%SIG</tt>
handlers before resuming <small>IO</small> operation.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The default in
Perl 5.7.3 and later is to automatically use the
<tt>&quot;:perlio&quot;</tt> layer.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that it is
not advisable to access a file handle within a signal
handler where that signal has interrupted an I/O operation
on that same handle. While perl will at least try hard not
to crash, there are no guarantees of data integrity; for
example, some data might get dropped or written twice.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Some networking
library functions like <i>gethostbyname()</i> are known to
have their own implementations of timeouts which may
conflict with your timeouts. If you have problems with such
functions, try using the <small>POSIX</small>
<i>sigaction()</i> function, which bypasses Perl safe
signals. Be warned that this does subject you to possible
memory corruption, as described above.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Instead of
setting <tt>$SIG{ALRM}</tt>:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">   local $SIG{ALRM} = sub { die &quot;alarm&quot; };</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">try something
like the following:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">  use POSIX qw(SIGALRM);
  POSIX::sigaction(SIGALRM, POSIX::SigAction&minus;&gt;new(sub { die &quot;alarm&quot; }))
          || die &quot;Error setting SIGALRM handler: $!\n&quot;;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Another way to
disable the safe signal behavior locally is to use the
<tt>&quot;Perl::Unsafe::Signals&quot;</tt> module from
<small>CPAN</small> , which affects all signals.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Restartable system calls</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">On systems that supported it,
older versions of Perl used the <small>SA_RESTART</small>
flag when installing <tt>%SIG</tt> handlers. This meant that
restartable system calls would continue rather than
returning when a signal arrived. In order to deliver
deferred signals promptly, Perl 5.7.3 and later do
<i>not</i> use <small>SA_RESTART</small> . Consequently,
restartable system calls can fail (with $! set to
<tt>&quot;EINTR&quot;</tt>) in places where they previously
would have succeeded.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The default
<tt>&quot;:perlio&quot;</tt> layer retries
<tt>&quot;read&quot;</tt>, <tt>&quot;write&quot;</tt> and
<tt>&quot;close&quot;</tt> as described above; interrupted
<tt>&quot;wait&quot;</tt> and <tt>&quot;waitpid&quot;</tt>
calls will always be retried.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Signals as
&quot;faults&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Certain signals like
<small>SEGV</small> , <small>ILL</small> , and
<small>BUS</small> are generated by virtual memory
addressing errors and similar &quot;faults&quot;. These are
normally fatal: there is little a Perl-level handler can do
with them. So Perl delivers them immediately rather than
attempting to defer them.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Signals triggered by operating
system state</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">On some operating systems
certain signal handlers are supposed to &quot;do
something&quot; before returning. One example can be
<small>CHLD</small> or <small>CLD</small> , which indicates
a child process has completed. On some operating systems the
signal handler is expected to <tt>&quot;wait&quot;</tt> for
the completed child process. On such systems the deferred
signal scheme will not work for those signals: it does not
do the <tt>&quot;wait&quot;</tt>. Again the failure will
look like a loop as the operating system will reissue the
signal because there are completed child processes that have
not yet been <tt>&quot;wait&quot;</tt>ed for.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you want the
old signal behavior back despite possible memory corruption,
set the environment variable
<tt>&quot;PERL_SIGNALS&quot;</tt> to
<tt>&quot;unsafe&quot;</tt>. This feature first appeared in
Perl 5.8.1.</p>

<h2>Named Pipes
<a name="Named Pipes"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A named pipe
(often referred to as a <small>FIFO</small> ) is an old Unix
<small>IPC</small> mechanism for processes communicating on
the same machine. It works just like regular anonymous
pipes, except that the processes rendezvous using a filename
and need not be related.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To create a
named pipe, use the <tt>&quot;POSIX::mkfifo()&quot;</tt>
function.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    use POSIX qw(mkfifo);
    mkfifo($path, 0700)     ||  die &quot;mkfifo $path failed: $!&quot;;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can also
use the Unix command <i>mknod</i>(1), or on some systems,
<i>mkfifo</i>(1). These may not be in your normal path,
though.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    # system return val is backwards, so &amp;&amp; not ||
    #
    $ENV{PATH} .= &quot;:/etc:/usr/etc&quot;;
    if  (      system(&quot;mknod&quot;,  $path, &quot;p&quot;)
            &amp;&amp; system(&quot;mkfifo&quot;, $path) )
    {
        die &quot;mk{nod,fifo} $path failed&quot;;
    }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A fifo is
convenient when you want to connect a process to an
unrelated one. When you open a fifo, the program will block
until there&rsquo;s something on the other end.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For example,
let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;d like to have your
<i>.signature</i> file be a named pipe that has a Perl
program on the other end. Now every time any program (like a
mailer, news reader, finger program, etc.) tries to read
from that file, the reading program will read the new
signature from your program. We&rsquo;ll use the
pipe-checking file-test operator, <b>&minus;p</b>, to find
out whether anyone (or anything) has accidentally removed
our fifo.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    chdir();    # go home
    my $FIFO = &quot;.signature&quot;;
    while (1) {
        unless (&minus;p $FIFO) {
            unlink $FIFO;   # discard any failure, will catch later
            require POSIX;  # delayed loading of heavy module
            POSIX::mkfifo($FIFO, 0700)
                                || die &quot;can't mkfifo $FIFO: $!&quot;;
        }
        # next line blocks till there's a reader
        open (FIFO, &quot;&gt; $FIFO&quot;)  || die &quot;can't open $FIFO: $!&quot;;
        print FIFO &quot;John Smith (smith\@host.org)\n&quot;, `fortune &minus;s`;
        close(FIFO)             || die &quot;can't close $FIFO: $!&quot;;
        sleep 2;                # to avoid dup signals

basic <i>open()</i> statement can also be used for
unidirectional interprocess communication by either
appending or prepending a pipe symbol to the second argument
to <i>open()</i>. Here&rsquo;s how to start something up in
a child process you intend to write to:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    open(SPOOLER, &quot;| cat &minus;v | lpr &minus;h 2&gt;/dev/null&quot;)
                        || die &quot;can't fork: $!&quot;;
    local $SIG{PIPE} = sub { die &quot;spooler pipe broke&quot; };
    print SPOOLER &quot;stuff\n&quot;;
    close SPOOLER       || die &quot;bad spool: $! $?&quot;;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">And
here&rsquo;s how to start up a child process you intend to
read from:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    open(STATUS, &quot;netstat &minus;an 2&gt;&amp;1 |&quot;)
                        || die &quot;can't fork: $!&quot;;
    while (&lt;STATUS&gt;) {
        next if /^(tcp|udp)/;
        print;
    }
    close STATUS        || die &quot;bad netstat: $! $?&quot;;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If one can be
sure that a particular program is a Perl script expecting
filenames in <tt>@ARGV</tt>, the clever programmer can write
something like this:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    % program f1 &quot;cmd1|&quot; &minus; f2 &quot;cmd2|&quot; f3 &lt; tmpfile</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">and no matter
which sort of shell it&rsquo;s called from, the Perl program
will read from the file <i>f1</i>, the process <i>cmd1</i>,
standard input (<i>tmpfile</i> in this case), the <i>f2</i>
file, the <i>cmd2</i> command, and finally the <i>f3</i>
file. Pretty nifty, eh?</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You might
notice that you could use backticks for much the same effect
as opening a pipe for reading:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    print grep { !/^(tcp|udp)/ } `netstat &minus;an 2&gt;&amp;1`;
    die &quot;bad netstatus ($?)&quot; if $?;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">While this is
true on the surface, it&rsquo;s much more efficient to
process the file one line or record at a time because then
you don&rsquo;t have to read the whole thing into memory at
once. It also gives you finer control of the whole process,
letting you kill off the child process early if you&rsquo;d
like.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Be careful to
check the return values from both <i>open()</i> and
<i>close()</i>. If you&rsquo;re <i>writing</i> to a pipe,
you should also trap <small>SIGPIPE</small> . Otherwise,
think of what happens when you start up a pipe to a command
that doesn&rsquo;t exist: the <i>open()</i> will in all
likelihood succeed (it only reflects the
<i>fork()</i>&rsquo;s success), but then your output will
fail--spectacularly. Perl can&rsquo;t know whether the
command worked, because your command is actually running in
a separate process whose <i>exec()</i> might have failed.
Therefore, while readers of bogus commands return just a
quick <small>EOF</small> , writers to bogus commands will
get hit with a signal, which they&rsquo;d best be prepared
to handle. Consider:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    open(FH, &quot;|bogus&quot;)      || die &quot;can't fork: $!&quot;;
    print FH &quot;bang\n&quot;;      #  neither necessary nor sufficient
                            #  to check print retval!
    close(FH)               || die &quot;can't close: $!&quot;;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The reason for
not checking the return value from <i>print()</i> is because
of pipe buffering; physical writes are delayed. That
won&rsquo;t blow up until the close, and it will blow up
with a <small>SIGPIPE</small> . To catch it, you could use
this:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    $SIG{PIPE} = &quot;IGNORE&quot;;
    open(FH, &quot;|bogus&quot;)  || die &quot;can't fork: $!&quot;;
    print FH &quot;bang\n&quot;;
    close(FH)           || die &quot;can't close: status=$?&quot;;</pre>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Filehandles</b>
<br>
Both the main process and any child processes it forks share
the same <small>STDIN</small> , <small>STDOUT</small> , and
<small>STDERR</small> filehandles. If both processes try to
access them at once, strange things can happen. You may also
want to close or reopen the filehandles for the child. You
can get around this by opening your pipe with <i>open()</i>,
but on some systems this means that the child process cannot
outlive the parent.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Background
Processes</b> <br>
You can run a command in the background with:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    system(&quot;cmd &amp;&quot;);</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
command&rsquo;s <small>STDOUT</small> and
<small>STDERR</small> (and possibly <small>STDIN</small> ,
depending on your shell) will be the same as the
parent&rsquo;s. You won&rsquo;t need to catch
<small>SIGCHLD</small> because of the double-fork taking
place; see below for details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Complete
Dissociation of Child from Parent</b> <br>
In some cases (starting server processes, for instance)
you&rsquo;ll want to completely dissociate the child process
from the parent. This is often called daemonization. A
well-behaved daemon will also <i>chdir()</i> to the root
directory so it doesn&rsquo;t prevent unmounting the
filesystem containing the directory from which it was
launched, and redirect its standard file descriptors from
and to <i>/dev/null</i> so that random output doesn&rsquo;t
wind up on the user&rsquo;s terminal.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    use POSIX &quot;setsid&quot;;
    sub daemonize {
        chdir(&quot;/&quot;)                      || die &quot;can't chdir to /: $!&quot;;
        open(STDIN,  &quot;&lt; /dev/null&quot;)     || die &quot;can't read /dev/null: $!&quot;;
        open(STDOUT, &quot;&gt; /dev/null&quot;)     || die &quot;can't write to /dev/null: $!&quot;;
        defined(my $pid = fork())       || die &quot;can't fork: $!&quot;;
        exit if $pid;                   # non&minus;zero now means I am the parent
        (setsid() != &minus;1)                || die &quot;Can't start a new session: $!&quot;
        open(STDERR, &quot;&gt;&amp;STDOUT&quot;)        || die &quot;can't dup stdout: $!&quot;;
    }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>fork()</i> has to come before the <i>setsid()</i> to
ensure you aren&rsquo;t a process group leader; the
<i>setsid()</i> will fail if you are. If your system
doesn&rsquo;t have the <i>setsid()</i> function, open
<i>/dev/tty</i> and use the <tt>&quot;TIOCNOTTY&quot;</tt>
<i>ioctl()</i> on it instead. See <i>tty</i>(4) for
details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Non-Unix users
should check their
<tt>&quot;</tt><i>Your_OS</i><tt>::Process&quot;</tt> module
for other possible solutions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Safe Pipe
Opens</b> <br>
Another interesting approach to <small>IPC</small> is making
your single program go multiprocess and communicate
between--or even amongst--yourselves. The <i>open()</i>
function will accept a file argument of either
<tt>&quot;&minus;|&quot;</tt> or
<tt>&quot;|&minus;&quot;</tt> to do a very interesting
thing: it forks a child connected to the filehandle
you&rsquo;ve opened. The child is running the same program
as the parent. This is useful for safely opening a file when
running under an assumed <small>UID</small> or
<small>GID</small> , for example. If you open a pipe
<i>to</i> minus, you can write to the filehandle you opened
and your kid will find it in <i>his</i> <small>STDIN</small>
. If you open a pipe <i>from</i> minus, you can read from
the filehandle you opened whatever your kid writes to
<i>his</i> <small>STDOUT</small> .</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    use English qw[ &minus;no_match_vars ];
    my $PRECIOUS = &quot;/path/to/some/safe/file&quot;;
    my $sleep_count;
    my $pid;
    do {
        $pid = open(KID_TO_WRITE, &quot;|&minus;&quot;);
        unless (defined $pid) {
            warn &quot;cannot fork: $!&quot;;
            die &quot;bailing out&quot; if $sleep_count++ &gt; 6;
            sleep 10;
        }
    } until defined $pid;
    if ($pid) {                 # I am the parent
        print KID_TO_WRITE @some_data;
        close(KID_TO_WRITE)     || warn &quot;kid exited $?&quot;;
    } else {                    # I am the child
        # drop permissions in setuid and/or setgid programs:
        ($EUID, $EGID) = ($UID, $GID);
        open (OUTFILE, &quot;&gt; $PRECIOUS&quot;)
                                || die &quot;can't open $PRECIOUS: $!&quot;;
        while (&lt;STDIN&gt;) {
            print OUTFILE;      # child's STDIN is parent's KID_TO_WRITE

    }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Another common
use for this construct is when you need to execute something
without the shell&rsquo;s interference. With
<i>system()</i>, it&rsquo;s straightforward, but you
can&rsquo;t use a pipe open or backticks safely.
That&rsquo;s because there&rsquo;s no way to stop the shell
from getting its hands on your arguments. Instead, use
lower-level control to call <i>exec()</i> directly.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Here&rsquo;s a
safe backtick or pipe open for read:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    my $pid = open(KID_TO_READ, &quot;&minus;|&quot;);
    defined($pid)           || die &quot;can't fork: $!&quot;;
    if ($pid) {             # parent
        while (&lt;KID_TO_READ&gt;) {
                            # do something interesting
        }
        close(KID_TO_READ)  || warn &quot;kid exited $?&quot;;
    } else {                # child
        ($EUID, $EGID) = ($UID, $GID); # suid only
        exec($program, @options, @args)
                            || die &quot;can't exec program: $!&quot;;
        # NOTREACHED
    }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">And
here&rsquo;s a safe pipe open for writing:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    my $pid = open(KID_TO_WRITE, &quot;|&minus;&quot;);
    defined($pid)           || die &quot;can't fork: $!&quot;;
    $SIG{PIPE} = sub { die &quot;whoops, $program pipe broke&quot; };
    if ($pid) {             # parent
        print KID_TO_WRITE @data;
        close(KID_TO_WRITE) || warn &quot;kid exited $?&quot;;
    } else {                # child
        ($EUID, $EGID) = ($UID, $GID);
        exec($program, @options, @args)
                            || die &quot;can't exec program: $!&quot;;
        # NOTREACHED
    }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is very easy
to dead-lock a process using this form of <i>open()</i>, or
indeed with any use of <i>pipe()</i> with multiple
subprocesses. The example above is &quot;safe&quot; because
it is simple and calls <i>exec()</i>. See &quot;Avoiding
Pipe Deadlocks&quot; for general safety principles, but
there are extra gotchas with Safe Pipe Opens.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In particular,
if you opened the pipe using <tt>&quot;open FH,
&quot;|&minus;&quot;&quot;</tt>, then you cannot simply use
<i>close()</i> in the parent process to close an unwanted
writer. Consider this code:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    my $pid = open(WRITER, &quot;|&minus;&quot;);        # fork open a kid
    defined($pid)               || die &quot;first fork failed: $!&quot;;
    if ($pid) {
        if (my $sub_pid = fork()) {
            defined($sub_pid)   || die &quot;second fork failed: $!&quot;;
            close(WRITER)       || die &quot;couldn't close WRITER: $!&quot;;
            # now do something else...
        }
        else {
            # first write to WRITER
            # ...
            # then when finished
            close(WRITER)       || die &quot;couldn't close WRITER: $!&quot;;
            exit(0);
        }
    }
    else {
        # first do something with STDIN, then
        exit(0);
    }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In the example
above, the true parent does not want to write to the
<small>WRITER</small> filehandle, so it closes it. However,
because <small>WRITER</small> was opened using
<tt>&quot;open FH, &quot;|&minus;&quot;&quot;</tt>, it has a
special behavior: closing it calls <i>waitpid()</i> (see
&quot;waitpid&quot; in perlfunc), which waits for the
subprocess to exit. If the child process ends up waiting for
something happening in the section marked &quot;do something
else&quot;, you have deadlock.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This can also
be a problem with intermediate subprocesses in more
complicated code, which will call <i>waitpid()</i> on all
open filehandles during global destruction--in no
predictable order.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To solve this,
you must manually use <i>pipe()</i>, <i>fork()</i>, and the
form of <i>open()</i> which sets one file descriptor to
another, as shown below:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    pipe(READER, WRITER)        || die &quot;pipe failed: $!&quot;;
    $pid = fork();
    defined($pid)               || die &quot;first fork failed: $!&quot;;
    if ($pid) {
        close READER;
        if (my $sub_pid = fork()) {
            defined($sub_pid)   || die &quot;first fork failed: $!&quot;;
            close(WRITER)       || die &quot;can't close WRITER: $!&quot;;
        }
        else {
            # write to WRITER...
            # ...
            # then  when finished
            close(WRITER)       || die &quot;can't close WRITER: $!&quot;;
            exit(0);
        }
        # write to WRITER...
    }
    else {
        open(STDIN, &quot;&lt;&amp;READER&quot;) || die &quot;can't reopen STDIN: $!&quot;;
        close(WRITER)           || die &quot;can't close WRITER: $!&quot;;
        # do something...
        exit(0);
    }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Since Perl
5.8.0, you can also use the list form of
<tt>&quot;open&quot;</tt> for pipes. This is preferred when
you wish to avoid having the shell interpret metacharacters
that may be in your command string.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">So for example,
instead of using:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    open(PS_PIPE, &quot;ps aux|&quot;)    || die &quot;can't open ps pipe: $!&quot;;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">One would use
either of these:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    open(PS_PIPE, &quot;&minus;|&quot;, &quot;ps&quot;, &quot;aux&quot;)
                                || die &quot;can't open ps pipe: $!&quot;;
    @ps_args = qw[ ps aux ];
    open(PS_PIPE, &quot;&minus;|&quot;, @ps_args)
                                || die &quot;can't open @ps_args|: $!&quot;;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Because there
are more than three arguments to <i>open()</i>, forks the
<i>ps</i>(1) command <i>without</i> spawning a shell, and
reads its standard output via the
<tt>&quot;PS_PIPE&quot;</tt> filehandle. The corresponding
syntax to <i>write</i> to command pipes is to use
<tt>&quot;|&minus;&quot;</tt> in place of
<tt>&quot;&minus;|&quot;</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This was
admittedly a rather silly example, because you&rsquo;re
using string literals whose content is perfectly safe. There
is therefore no cause to resort to the harder-to-read,
multi-argument form of pipe <i>open()</i>. However, whenever
you cannot be assured that the program arguments are free of
shell metacharacters, the fancier form of <i>open()</i>
should be used. For example:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    @grep_args = (&quot;egrep&quot;, &quot;&minus;i&quot;, $some_pattern, @many_files);
    open(GREP_PIPE, &quot;&minus;|&quot;, @grep_args)
                        || die &quot;can't open @grep_args|: $!&quot;;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Here the
multi-argument form of pipe <i>open()</i> is preferred
because the pattern and indeed even the filenames themselves
might hold metacharacters.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Be aware that
these operations are full Unix forks, which means they may
not be correctly implemented on all alien systems.
Additionally, these are not true multithreading. To learn
more about threading, see the <i>modules</i> file mentioned
below in the <small>SEE ALSO</small> section.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Avoiding
Pipe Deadlocks</b> <br>
Whenever you have more than one subprocess, you must be
careful that each closes whichever half of any pipes created
for interprocess communication it is not using. This is
because any child process reading from the pipe and
expecting an <small>EOF</small> will never receive it, and
therefore never exit. A single process closing a pipe is not
enough to close it; the last process with the pipe open must
close it for it to read <small>EOF</small> .</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Certain
built-in Unix features help prevent this most of the time.
For instance, filehandles have a &quot;close on exec&quot;
flag, which is set <i>en masse</i> under control of the
<tt>$^F</tt> variable. This is so any filehandles you
didn&rsquo;t explicitly route to the <small>STDIN</small> ,
<small>STDOUT</small> or <small>STDERR</small> of a child
<i>program</i> will be automatically closed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Always
explicitly and immediately call <i>close()</i> on the
writable end of any pipe, unless that process is actually
writing to it. Even if you don&rsquo;t explicitly call
<i>close()</i>, Perl will still <i>close()</i> all
filehandles during global destruction. As previously
discussed, if those filehandles have been opened with Safe
Pipe Open, this will result in calling <i>waitpid()</i>,
which may again deadlock.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Bidirectional
Communication with Another Process</b> <br>
While this works reasonably well for unidirectional
communication, what about bidirectional communication? The
most obvious approach doesn&rsquo;t work:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    # THIS DOES NOT WORK!!
    open(PROG_FOR_READING_AND_WRITING, &quot;| some program |&quot;)</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you forget
to <tt>&quot;use warnings&quot;</tt>, you&rsquo;ll miss out
entirely on the helpful diagnostic message:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    Can't do bidirectional pipe at &minus;e line 1.</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you really
want to, you can use the standard <i>open2()</i> from the
<tt>&quot;IPC::Open2&quot;</tt> module to catch both ends.
There&rsquo;s also an <i>open3()</i> in
<tt>&quot;IPC::Open3&quot;</tt> for tridirectional I/O so
you can also catch your child&rsquo;s <small>STDERR</small>
, but doing so would then require an awkward <i>select()</i>
loop and wouldn&rsquo;t allow you to use normal Perl input
operations.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you look at
its source, you&rsquo;ll see that <i>open2()</i> uses
low-level primitives like the <i>pipe()</i> and
<i>exec()</i> syscalls to create all the connections.
Although it might have been more efficient by using
<i>socketpair()</i>, this would have been even less portable
than it already is. The <i>open2()</i> and <i>open3()</i>
functions are unlikely to work anywhere except on a Unix
system, or at least one purporting <small>POSIX</small>
compliance.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Here&rsquo;s an
example of using <i>open2()</i>:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    use FileHandle;
    use IPC::Open2;
    $pid = open2(*Reader, *Writer, &quot;cat &minus;un&quot;);
    print Writer &quot;stuff\n&quot;;
    $got = &lt;Reader&gt;;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The problem
with this is that buffering is really going to ruin your
day. Even though your <tt>&quot;Writer&quot;</tt> filehandle
is auto-flushed so the process on the other end gets your
data in a timely manner, you can&rsquo;t usually do anything
to force that process to give its data to you in a similarly
quick fashion. In this special case, we could actually so,
because we gave <i>cat</i> a <b>&minus;u</b> flag to make it
unbuffered. But very few commands are designed to operate
over pipes, so this seldom works unless you yourself wrote
the program on the other end of the double-ended pipe.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A solution to
this is to use a library which uses pseudottys to make your
program behave more reasonably. This way you don&rsquo;t
have to have control over the source code of the program
you&rsquo;re using. The <tt>&quot;Expect&quot;</tt> module
from <small>CPAN</small> also addresses this kind of thing.
This module requires two other modules from

<h2>Sockets: Client/Server Communication
<a name="Sockets: Client/Server Communication"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">While not
entirely limited to Unix-derived operating systems (e.g.,
WinSock on PCs provides socket support, as do some
<small>VMS</small> libraries), you might not have sockets on
your system, in which case this section probably isn&rsquo;t
going to do you much good. With sockets, you can do both
virtual circuits like <small>TCP</small> streams and
datagrams like <small>UDP</small> packets. You may be able
to do even more depending on your system.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The Perl
functions for dealing with sockets have the same names as
the corresponding system calls in C, but their arguments
tend to differ for two reasons. First, Perl filehandles work
differently than C file descriptors. Second, Perl already
knows the length of its strings, so you don&rsquo;t need to
pass that information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">One of the
major problems with ancient, antemillennial socket code in
Perl was that it used hard-coded values for some of the
constants, which severely hurt portability. If you ever see
code that does anything like explicitly setting
<tt>&quot;$AF_INET = 2&quot;</tt>, you know you&rsquo;re in
for big trouble. An immeasurably superior approach is to use
the <tt>&quot;Socket&quot;</tt> module, which more reliably
grants access to the various constants and functions
you&rsquo;ll need.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you&rsquo;re
not writing a server/client for an existing protocol like
<small>NNTP</small> or <small>SMTP</small> , you should give
some thought to how your server will know when the client
has finished talking, and vice-versa. Most protocols are
based on one-line messages and responses (so one party knows
the other has finished when a &quot;\n&quot; is received) or
multi-line messages and responses that end with a period on
an empty line (&quot;\n.\n&quot; terminates a
message/response).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Internet
Line Terminators</b> <br>
The Internet line terminator is &quot;\015\012&quot;. Under
<small>ASCII</small> variants of Unix, that could usually be
written as &quot;\r\n&quot;, but under other systems,
&quot;\r\n&quot; might at times be &quot;\015\015\012&quot;,
&quot;\012\012\015&quot;, or something completely different.
The standards specify writing &quot;\015\012&quot; to be
conformant (be strict in what you provide), but they also
recommend accepting a lone &quot;\012&quot; on input (be
lenient in what you require). We haven&rsquo;t always been
very good about that in the code in this manpage, but unless
you&rsquo;re on a Mac from way back in its pre-Unix dark
ages, you&rsquo;ll probably be ok.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Internet
<small>TCP</small> Clients and Servers</b> <br>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This server
takes the trouble to clone off a child version via
<i>fork()</i> for each incoming request. That way it can
handle many requests at once, which you might not always
want. Even if you don&rsquo;t <i>fork()</i>, the
<i>listen()</i> will allow that many pending connections.
Forking servers have to be particularly careful about
cleaning up their dead children (called &quot;zombies&quot;
in Unix parlance), because otherwise you&rsquo;ll quickly
fill up your process table. The <small>REAPER</small>
subroutine is used here to call <i>waitpid()</i> for any
child processes that have finished, thereby ensuring that
they terminate cleanly and don&rsquo;t join the ranks of the
living dead.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Within the
while loop we call <i>accept()</i> and check to see if it
returns a false value. This would normally indicate a system
error needs to be reported. However, the introduction of
safe signals (see &quot;Deferred Signals (Safe
Signals)&quot; above) in Perl 5.7.3 means that
<i>accept()</i> might also be interrupted when the process
receives a signal. This typically happens when one of the
forked subprocesses exits and notifies the parent process
with a <small>CHLD</small> signal.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If
<i>accept()</i> is interrupted by a signal, $! will be set
to <small>EINTR</small> . If this happens, we can safely
continue to the next iteration of the loop and another call
to <i>accept()</i>. It is important that your signal
handling code not modify the value of $!, or else this test
will likely fail. In the <small>REAPER</small> subroutine we
create a local version of $! before calling
<i>waitpid()</i>. When <i>waitpid()</i> sets $! to
<small>ECHILD</small> as it inevitably does when it has no
more children waiting, it updates the local copy and leaves
the original unchanged.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You should use
the <b>&minus;T</b> flag to enable taint checking (see
perlsec) even if we aren&rsquo;t running setuid or setgid.
This is always a good idea for servers or any program run on
behalf of someone else (like <small>CGI</small> scripts),
because it lessens the chances that people from the outside
will be able to compromise your system.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As you see,
it&rsquo;s remarkably similar to the Internet domain
<small>TCP</small> server, so much so, in fact, that
we&rsquo;ve omitted several duplicate
functions--<i>spawn()</i>, <i>logmsg()</i>, <i>ctime()</i>,
and <i><small>REAPER</small> ()</i>&minus;&minus;which are
the same as in the other server.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">So why would
you ever want to use a Unix domain socket instead of a
simpler named pipe? Because a named pipe doesn&rsquo;t give
you sessions. You can&rsquo;t tell one process&rsquo;s data
from another&rsquo;s. With socket programming, you get a
separate session for each client; that&rsquo;s why
<i>accept()</i> takes two arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For example,
let&rsquo;s say that you have a long-running database server
daemon that you want folks to be able to access from the
Web, but only if they go through a <small>CGI</small>
interface. You&rsquo;d have a small, simple
<small>CGI</small> program that does whatever checks and
logging you feel like, and then acts as a Unix-domain client
and connects to your private server.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Here are what
those parameters to the <i>new()</i> constructor mean: <br>
&quot;Proto&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This is which protocol to use.
In this case, the socket handle returned will be connected
to a <small>TCP</small> socket, because we want a
stream-oriented connection, that is, one that acts pretty
much like a plain old file. Not all sockets are this of this
type. For example, the <small>UDP</small> protocol can be
used to make a datagram socket, used for
message-passing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot;PeerAddr&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This is the name or Internet
address of the remote host the server is running on. We
could have specified a longer name like
<tt>&quot;www.perl.com&quot;</tt>, or an address like
<tt>&quot;207.171.7.72&quot;</tt>. For demonstration
purposes, we&rsquo;ve used the special hostname
<tt>&quot;localhost&quot;</tt>, which should always mean the
current machine you&rsquo;re running on. The corresponding
Internet address for localhost is
<tt>&quot;127.0.0.1&quot;</tt>, if you&rsquo;d rather use
that.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot;PeerPort&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This is the service name or
port number we&rsquo;d like to connect to. We could have
gotten away with using just <tt>&quot;daytime&quot;</tt> on
systems with a well-configured system services file,[
<small>FOOTNOTE:</small> The system services file is found
in <i>/etc/services</i> under Unixy systems.] but here
we&rsquo;ve specified the port number (13) in parentheses.
Using just the number would have also worked, but numeric
literals make careful programmers nervous.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Notice how the
return value from the <tt>&quot;new&quot;</tt> constructor
is used as a filehandle in the <tt>&quot;while&quot;</tt>
loop? That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s called an <i>indirect
filehandle</i>, a scalar variable containing a filehandle.
You can use it the same way you would a normal filehandle.
For example, you can read one line from it this way:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    $line = &lt;$handle&gt;;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">all remaining

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>A Webget
Client</b> <br>
Here&rsquo;s a simple client that takes a remote host to
fetch a document from, and then a list of files to get from
that host. This is a more interesting client than the
previous one because it first sends something to the server
before fetching the server&rsquo;s response.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    #!/usr/bin/perl &minus;w
    use IO::Socket;
    unless (@ARGV &gt; 1) { die &quot;usage: $0 host url ...&quot; }
    $host = shift(@ARGV);
    $EOL = &quot;\015\012&quot;;
    $BLANK = $EOL x 2;
    for my $document (@ARGV) {
        $remote = IO::Socket::INET&minus;&gt;new( Proto     =&gt; &quot;tcp&quot;,
                                         PeerAddr  =&gt; $host,
                                         PeerPort  =&gt; &quot;http(80)&quot;,
                  )     || die &quot;cannot connect to httpd on $host&quot;;
        $remote&minus;&gt;autoflush(1);
        print $remote &quot;GET $document HTTP/1.0&quot; . $BLANK;
        while ( &lt;$remote&gt; ) { print }
        close $remote;
    }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The web server
handling the <small>HTTP</small> service is assumed to be at
its standard port, number 80. If the server you&rsquo;re
trying to connect to is at a different port, like 1080 or
8080, you should specify it as the named-parameter pair,
<tt>&quot;PeerPort =&gt; 8080&quot;</tt>. The
<tt>&quot;autoflush&quot;</tt> method is used on the socket
because otherwise the system would buffer up the output we
sent it. (If you&rsquo;re on a prehistoric Mac, you&rsquo;ll
also need to change every <tt>&quot;\n&quot;</tt> in your
code that sends data over the network to be a
<tt>&quot;\015\012&quot;</tt> instead.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Connecting to
the server is only the first part of the process: once you
have the connection, you have to use the server&rsquo;s
language. Each server on the network has its own little
command language that it expects as input. The string that
we send to the server starting with &quot;
<small>GET</small> &quot; is in <small>HTTP</small> syntax.
In this case, we simply request each specified document.
Yes, we really are making a new connection for each
document, even though it&rsquo;s the same host. That&rsquo;s
the way you always used to have to speak <small>HTTP</small>
. Recent versions of web browsers may request that the
remote server leave the connection open a little while, but
the server doesn&rsquo;t have to honor such a request.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Here&rsquo;s an
example of running that program, which we&rsquo;ll call
<i>webget</i>:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    % webget www.perl.com /guanaco.html
    HTTP/1.1 404 File Not Found

    Connection: close

    &lt;BODY&gt;&lt;H1&gt;File Not Found&lt;/H1&gt;
    The requested URL /guanaco.html was not found on this server.&lt;P&gt;
    &lt;/BODY&gt;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Ok, so
that&rsquo;s not very interesting, because it didn&rsquo;t
find that particular document. But a long response
wouldn&rsquo;t have fit on this page.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For a more
featureful version of this program, you should look to the
<i>lwp-request</i> program included with the
<small>LWP</small> modules from <small>CPAN</small> .</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Interactive
Client with IO::Socket</b> <br>
Well, that&rsquo;s all fine if you want to send one command
and get one answer, but what about setting up something
fully interactive, somewhat like the way <i>telnet</i>
works? That way you can type a line, get the answer, type a
line, get the answer, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This client is
more complicated than the two we&rsquo;ve done so far, but
if you&rsquo;re on a system that supports the powerful
<tt>&quot;fork&quot;</tt> call, the solution isn&rsquo;t
that rough. Once you&rsquo;ve made the connection to
whatever service you&rsquo;d like to chat with, call
<tt>&quot;fork&quot;</tt> to clone your process. Each of
these two identical process has a very simple job to do: the
parent copies everything from the socket to standard output,
while the child simultaneously copies everything from
standard input to the socket. To accomplish the same thing
using just one process would be <i>much</i> harder, because
it&rsquo;s easier to code two processes to do one thing than
it is to code one process to do two things. (This
keep-it-simple principle a cornerstones of the Unix
philosophy, and good software engineering as well, which is
probably why it&rsquo;s spread to other systems.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Here&rsquo;s
the code:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    #!/usr/bin/perl &minus;w

    use IO::Socket;
    my ($host, $port, $kidpid, $handle, $line);

    ($host, $port) = @ARGV;
    # create a tcp connection to the specified host and port
    $handle = IO::Socket::INET&minus;&gt;new(Proto     =&gt; &quot;tcp&quot;,
                                    PeerAddr  =&gt; $host,

        # copy the socket to standard output
        while (defined ($line = &lt;$handle&gt;)) {
            print STDOUT $line;
        }
        kill(&quot;TERM&quot;, $kidpid);   # send SIGTERM to child
    }
    # the else{} block runs only in the child process
    else {
        # copy standard input to the socket
        while (defined ($line = &lt;STDIN&gt;)) {
            print $handle $line;
        }
        exit(0);                # just in case

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<tt>&quot;kill&quot;</tt> function in the parent&rsquo;s
<tt>&quot;if&quot;</tt> block is there to send a signal to
our child process, currently running in the

server has closed its end of the connection.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the remote
server sends data a byte at time, and you need that data
immediately without waiting for a newline (which might not
happen), you may wish to replace the
<tt>&quot;while&quot;</tt> loop in the parent with the
following:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    my $byte;

call for each byte you want to read is not very efficient
(to put it mildly) but is the simplest to explain and works
reasonably well.</p>

<h2>TCP Servers with IO::Socket
<a name="TCP Servers with IO::Socket"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As always,
setting up a server is little bit more involved than running
a client. The model is that the server creates a special
kind of socket that does nothing but listen on a particular
port for incoming connections. It does this by calling the
<tt>&quot;IO::Socket::INET&minus;&gt;new()&quot;</tt> method
with slightly different arguments than the client did. <br>
Proto</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This is which protocol to use.
Like our clients, we&rsquo;ll still specify
<tt>&quot;tcp&quot;</tt> here.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">LocalPort</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">We specify a local port in the
<tt>&quot;LocalPort&quot;</tt> argument, which we
didn&rsquo;t do for the client. This is service name or port
number for which you want to be the server. (Under Unix,
ports under 1024 are restricted to the superuser.) In our
sample, we&rsquo;ll use port 9000, but you can use any port
that&rsquo;s not currently in use on your system. If you try
to use one already in used, you&rsquo;ll get an
&quot;Address already in use&quot; message. Under Unix, the
<tt>&quot;netstat &minus;a&quot;</tt> command will show
which services current have servers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Listen</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The <tt>&quot;Listen&quot;</tt>
parameter is set to the maximum number of pending
connections we can accept until we turn away incoming
clients. Think of it as a call-waiting queue for your
telephone. The low-level Socket module has a special symbol
for the system maximum, which is <small>SOMAXCONN</small>
.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Reuse</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The <tt>&quot;Reuse&quot;</tt>
parameter is needed so that we restart our server manually
without waiting a few minutes to allow system buffers to
clear out.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Once the
generic server socket has been created using the parameters
listed above, the server then waits for a new client to
connect to it. The server blocks in the
<tt>&quot;accept&quot;</tt> method, which eventually accepts
a bidirectional connection from the remote client. (Make
sure to autoflush this handle to circumvent buffering.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To add to
user-friendliness, our server prompts the user for commands.
Most servers don&rsquo;t do this. Because of the prompt
without a newline, you&rsquo;ll have to use the
<tt>&quot;sysread&quot;</tt> variant of the interactive
client above.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This server
accepts one of five different commands, sending output back
to the client. Unlike most network servers, this one handles
only one incoming client at a time. Multithreaded servers
are covered in Chapter 16 of the Camel.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Here&rsquo;s
the code. We&rsquo;ll</p>

<h2>UDP: Message Passing
<a name="UDP: Message Passing"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Another kind of
client-server setup is one that uses not connections, but
messages. <small>UDP</small> communications involve much
lower overhead but also provide less reliability, as there
are no promises that messages will arrive at all, let alone
in order and unmangled. Still, <small>UDP</small> offers
some advantages over <small>TCP</small> , including being
able to &quot;broadcast&quot; or &quot;multicast&quot; to a
whole bunch of destination hosts at once (usually on your
local subnet). If you find yourself overly concerned about
reliability and start building checks into your message
system, then you probably should use just <small>TCP</small>
to start with.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><small>UDP</small>
datagrams are <i>not</i> a bytestream and should not be
treated as such. This makes using I/O mechanisms with
internal buffering like stdio (i.e. <i>print()</i> and
friends) especially cumbersome. Use <i>syswrite()</i>, or
better <i>send()</i>, like in the example below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Here&rsquo;s a
<small>UDP</small> program similar to the sample Internet
<small>TCP</small> client given earlier. However, instead of
checking one host at a time, the <small>UDP</small> version
will check many of them asynchronously by simulating a
multicast and then using <i>select()</i> to do a timed-out
wait for I/O. To do something similar with
<small>TCP</small> , you&rsquo;d have to use a different
socket handle for each host.</p>

<tt>&quot;IPC::Shareable&quot;</tt> or
<tt>&quot;threads::shared&quot;</tt> modules for that.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Here&rsquo;s a

    # the buffer of shmread is zero&minus;character end&minus;padded.
    substr($buff, index($buff, &quot;\0&quot;)) = &quot;&quot;;

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The SysV

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A small example
demonstrating SysV message queues:</p>

<h2>NOTES
<a name="NOTES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Most of these
routines quietly but politely return
<tt>&quot;undef&quot;</tt> when they fail instead of causing
your program to die right then and there due to an uncaught
exception. (Actually, some of the new <i>Socket</i>
conversion functions do <i>croak()</i> on bad arguments.) It
is therefore essential to check return values from these
functions. Always begin your socket programs this way for
optimal success, and don&rsquo;t forget to add the
<b>&minus;T</b> taint-checking flag to the
<tt>&quot;#!&quot;</tt> line for servers:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    #!/usr/bin/perl &minus;Tw
    use strict;
    use sigtrap;
    use Socket;</pre>


<h2>BUGS
<a name="BUGS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These routines
all create system-specific portability problems. As noted
elsewhere, Perl is at the mercy of your C libraries for much
of its system behavior. It&rsquo;s probably safest to assume
broken SysV semantics for signals and to stick with simple
<small>TCP</small> and <small>UDP</small> socket operations;
e.g., don&rsquo;t try to pass open file descriptors over a
local <small>UDP</small> datagram socket if you want your
code to stand a chance of being portable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There&rsquo;s a
lot more to networking than this, but this should get you
started.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For intrepid
programmers, the indispensable textbook is <i>Unix Network
Programming, 2nd Edition, Volume 1</i> by W. Richard Stevens
(published by Prentice-Hall). Most books on networking
address the subject from the perspective of a C programmer;
translation to Perl is left as an exercise for the
reader.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>IO::Socket</i>(3) manpage describes the object library,
and the <i>Socket</i>(3) manpage describes the low-level
interface to sockets. Besides the obvious functions in
perlfunc, you should also check out the <i>modules</i> file
at your nearest <small>CPAN</small> site, especially
&lt;http://www.cpan.org/modules/00modlist.long.html#ID5_Networking_&gt;.
See perlmodlib or best yet, the <i>Perl
<small>FAQ</small></i> for a description of what
<small>CPAN</small> is and where to get it if the previous
link doesn&rsquo;t work for you.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Section 5 of
<small>CPAN</small> &rsquo;s <i>modules</i> file is devoted
to &quot;Networking, Device Control (modems), and
