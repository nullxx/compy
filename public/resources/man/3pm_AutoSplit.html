<h2>NAME
<a name="NAME"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">AutoSplit
&minus; split a package for autoloading</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>


<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"> autosplit($file, $dir, $keep, $check, $modtime);
 autosplit_lib_modules(@modules);</pre>


<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This function
will split up your program into files that the AutoLoader
module can handle. It is used by both the standard perl
libraries and by the MakeMaker utility, to automatically
configure libraries for autoloading.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<tt>&quot;autosplit&quot;</tt> interface splits the
specified file into a hierarchy rooted at the directory
<tt>$dir</tt>. It creates directories as needed to reflect
class hierarchy, and creates the file <i>autosplit.ix</i>.
This file acts as both forward declaration of all package
routines, and as timestamp for the last update of the
hierarchy.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The remaining
three arguments to <tt>&quot;autosplit&quot;</tt> govern
other options to the autosplitter. <br>
$keep</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%;">If the third argument,
<i>$keep</i>, is false, then any pre-existing
<tt>&quot;*.al&quot;</tt> files in the autoload directory
are removed if they are no longer part of the module
(obsoleted functions). <tt>$keep</tt> defaults to 0.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">$check</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%;">The fourth argument,
<i>$check</i>, instructs <tt>&quot;autosplit&quot;</tt> to
check the module currently being split to ensure that it
includes a <tt>&quot;use&quot;</tt> specification for the
AutoLoader module, and skips the module if AutoLoader is not
detected. <tt>$check</tt> defaults to 1.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">$modtime</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%;">Lastly, the <i>$modtime</i>
argument specifies that <tt>&quot;autosplit&quot;</tt> is to
check the modification time of the module against that of
the <tt>&quot;autosplit.ix&quot;</tt> file, and only split
the module if it is newer. <tt>$modtime</tt> defaults to
1.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Typical use of
AutoSplit in the perl MakeMaker utility is via the
command-line with:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"> perl &minus;e 'use AutoSplit; autosplit($ARGV[0], $ARGV[1], 0, 1, 1)'</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Defined as a
Make macro, it is invoked with file and directory arguments;
<tt>&quot;autosplit&quot;</tt> will split the specified file
into the specified directory and delete obsolete
<tt>&quot;.al&quot;</tt> files, after checking first that
the module does use the AutoLoader, and ensuring that the
module is not already currently split in its current form
(the modtime test).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<tt>&quot;autosplit_lib_modules&quot;</tt> form is used in
the building of perl. It takes as input a list of files
(modules) that are assumed to reside in a directory
<b>lib</b> relative to the current directory. Each file is
sent to the autosplitter one at a time, to be split into the
directory <b>lib/auto</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In both usages
of the autosplitter, only subroutines defined following the
perl <i>__END__</i> token are split out into separate files.
Some routines may be placed prior to this marker to force
their immediate loading and parsing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Multiple
packages</b> <br>
As of version 1.01 of the AutoSplit module it is possible to
have multiple packages within a single file. Both of the
following cases are supported:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">   package NAME;
   __END__
   sub AAA { ... }
   package NAME::option1;
   sub BBB { ... }
   package NAME::option2;
   sub BBB { ... }
   package NAME;
   __END__
   sub AAA { ... }
   sub NAME::option1::BBB { ... }
   sub NAME::option2::BBB { ... }</pre>


<h2>DIAGNOSTICS
<a name="DIAGNOSTICS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><tt>&quot;AutoSplit&quot;</tt>
will inform the user if it is necessary to create the
top-level directory specified in the invocation. It is
preferred that the script or installation process that
invokes <tt>&quot;AutoSplit&quot;</tt> have created the full
directory path ahead of time. This warning may indicate that
the module is being split into an incorrect path.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><tt>&quot;AutoSplit&quot;</tt>
will warn the user of all subroutines whose name causes
potential file naming conflicts on machines with drastically
limited (8 characters or less) file name length. Since the
subroutine name is used as the file name, these warnings can
aid in portability to such systems.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Warnings are
issued and the file skipped if
<tt>&quot;AutoSplit&quot;</tt> cannot locate either the
<i>__END__</i> marker or a &quot;package
Name;&quot;&minus;style specification.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><tt>&quot;AutoSplit&quot;</tt>
will also emit general diagnostics for inability to create
directories or files.</p>

    For those of you that choose to use the GNU General Public License,
    my interpretation of the GNU General Public License is that no Perl
    script falls under the terms of the GPL unless you explicitly put
    said script under the terms of the GPL yourself.  Furthermore, any
    object code linked with perl does not automatically fall under the
    terms of the GPL, provided such object code only adds definitions
    of subroutines and variables, and does not otherwise impair the
    resulting interpreter from executing any standard Perl script.  I
    consider linking in C subroutines in this manner to be the moral
    equivalent of defining subroutines in the Perl language itself.  You
    may sell such an object file as proprietary provided that you provide
    or offer to provide the Perl source, as specified by the GNU General
    Public License.  (This is merely an alternate way of specifying input
    to the program.)  You may also sell a binary produced by the dumping of
    a running Perl script that belongs to you, provided that you provide or
    offer to provide the Perl source as specified by the GPL.  (The
    fact that a Perl interpreter and your code are in the same binary file
    is, in this case, a form of mere aggregation.)  This is my interpretation
    of the GPL.  If you still have concerns or difficulties understanding
    my intent, feel free to contact me.  Of course, the Artistic License
    spells all this out for your protection, so you may prefer to use that.</pre>
