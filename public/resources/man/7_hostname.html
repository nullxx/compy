<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Hostnames are
domains, where a domain is a hierarchical, dot-separated
list of subdomains; for example, the machine monet, in the
Berkeley subdomain of the EDU domain would be represented as
&quot;monet.Berkeley.EDU&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Hostnames are
often used with network client and server programs, which
must generally translate the name to an address for use.
(This task is generally performed by either
<b>getaddrinfo</b>(3) or the obsolete
<b>gethostbyname</b>(3).) Hostnames are resolved by the
Internet name resolver in the following fashion.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the name
consists of a single component, that is, contains no dot,
and if the environment variable <b>HOSTALIASES</b> is set to
the name of a file, that file is searched for any string
matching the input hostname. The file should consist of
lines made up of two white-space separated strings, the
first of which is the hostname alias, and the second of
which is the complete hostname to be substituted for that
alias. If a case-insensitive match is found between the
hostname to be resolved and the first field of a line in the
file, the substituted name is looked up with no further
processing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the input
name ends with a trailing dot, the trailing dot is removed,
and the remaining name is looked up with no further
processing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the input
name does not end with a trailing dot, it is looked up by
searching through a list of domains until a match is found.
The default search list includes first the local domain,
then its parent domains with at least 2 name components
(longest first). For example, in the domain CS.Berkeley.EDU,
the name lithium.CChem will be checked first as
lithium.CChem.CS.Berkeley.EDU and then as
lithium.CChem.Berkeley.EDU. Lithium.CChem.EDU will not be
tried, as there is only one component remaining from the
local domain. The search path can be changed from the
default by a system-wide configuration file (see
<b>resolver</b>(5)).</p>
