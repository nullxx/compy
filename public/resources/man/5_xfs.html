<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">xfs &minus;
layout, mount options, and supported file attributes for the
XFS filesystem</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">An XFS
filesystem can reside on a regular disk partition or on a
logical volume. An XFS filesystem has up to three parts: a
data section, a log section, and a realtime section. Using
the default <b>mkfs.xfs</b>(8) options, the realtime section
is absent, and the log area is contained within the data
section. The log section can be either separate from the
data section or contained within it. The filesystem sections
are divided into a certain number of <i>blocks</i>, whose
size is specified at <b>mkfs.xfs</b>(8) time with the
<b>&minus;b</b> option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The data
section contains all the filesystem metadata (inodes,
directories, indirect blocks) as well as the user file data
for ordinary (non-realtime) files and the log area if the
log is <i>internal</i> to the data section. The data section
is divided into a number of <i>allocation groups</i>. The
number and size of the allocation groups are chosen by
<b>mkfs.xfs</b>(8) so that there is normally a small number
of equal-sized groups. The number of allocation groups
controls the amount of parallelism available in file and
block allocation. It should be increased from the default if
there is sufficient memory and a lot of allocation activity.
The number of allocation groups should not be set very high,
since this can cause large amounts of CPU time to be used by
the filesystem, especially when the filesystem is nearly
full. More allocation groups are added (of the original
size) when <b>xfs_growfs</b>(8) is run.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The log section
(or area, if it is internal to the data section) is used to
store changes to filesystem metadata while the filesystem is
running until those changes are made to the data section. It
is written sequentially during normal operation and read
only during mount. When mounting a filesystem after a crash,
the log is read to complete operations that were in progress
at the time of the crash.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The realtime
section is used to store the data of realtime files. These
files had an attribute bit set through <b>xfsctl</b>(3)
after file creation, before any data was written to the
file. The realtime section is divided into a number of
<i>extents</i> of fixed size (specified at
<b>mkfs.xfs</b>(8) time). Each file in the realtime section
has an extent size that is a multiple of the realtime
section extent size.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Each allocation
group contains several data structures. The first sector
contains the superblock. For allocation groups after the
first, the superblock is just a copy and is not updated
after <b>mkfs.xfs</b>(8). The next three sectors contain
information for block and inode allocation within the
allocation group. Also contained within each allocation
group are data structures to locate free blocks and inodes;
these are located through the header structures.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Each XFS
filesystem is labeled with a Universal Unique Identifier
(UUID). The UUID is stored in every allocation group header
and is used to help distinguish one XFS filesystem from
another, therefore you should avoid using <b>dd</b>(1) or
other block-by-block copying programs to copy XFS
filesystems. If two XFS filesystems on the same machine have
the same UUID, <b>xfsdump</b>(8) may become confused when
doing incremental and resumed dumps. <b>xfsdump</b>(8) and
<b>xfsrestore</b>(8) are recommended for making copies of
XFS filesystems.</p>

<h2>OPERATIONS
<a name="OPERATIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Some
functionality specific to the XFS filesystem is accessible
to applications through the <b>xfsctl</b>(3) and by-handle
(see <b>open_by_handle</b>(3)) interfaces.</p>

<h2>MOUNT OPTIONS
<a name="MOUNT OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
XFS-specific mount options may be used when mounting an XFS
filesystem. Other generic options may be used as well; refer
to the <b>mount</b>(8) manual page for more details. <b><br>
allocsize=size</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Sets the buffered I/O
end-of-file preallocation size when doing delayed allocation
writeout. Valid values for this option are page size
(typically 4KiB) through to 1GiB, inclusive, in power-of-2
increments.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The default
behavior is for dynamic end-of-file preallocation size,
which uses a set of heuristics to optimise the preallocation
size based on the current allocation patterns within the
file and the access patterns to the file. Specifying a fixed
allocsize value turns off the dynamic behavior.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>attr2</b>|<b>noattr2</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The options enable/disable an
&quot;opportunistic&quot; improvement to be made in the way
inline extended attributes are stored on-disk. When the new
form is used for the first time when attr2 is selected
(either when setting or removing extended attributes) the
on-disk superblock feature bit field will be updated to
reflect this format being in use.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The default
behavior is determined by the on-disk feature bit indicating
that attr2 behavior is active. If either mount option it
set, then that becomes the new default used by the
filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">CRC enabled
filesystems always use the attr2 format, and so will reject
the noattr2 mount option if it is set.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>barrier</b>|<b>nobarrier</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Enables/disables the use of
block layer write barriers for writes into the journal and
for data integrity operations. This allows for drive level
write caching to be enabled, for devices that support write
barriers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Barriers are
enabled by default.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>discard</b>|<b>nodiscard</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Enable/disable the issuing of
commands to let the block device reclaim space freed by the
filesystem. This is useful for SSD devices, thinly
provisioned LUNs and virtual machine images, but may have a
performance impact.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Note: It is
currently recommended that you use the fstrim application to
discard unused blocks rather than the discard mount option
because the performance impact of this option is quite
severe. For this reason, nodiscard is the default.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>grpid</b>|<b>bsdgroups</b>|<b>nogrpid</b>|<b>sysvgroups</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">These options define what group
ID a newly created file gets. When grpid is set, it takes
the group ID of the directory in which it is created;
otherwise it takes the fsgid of the current process, unless
the directory has the setgid bit set, in which case it takes
the gid from the parent directory, and also gets the setgid
bit set if it is a directory itself.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>filestreams</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Make the data allocator use the
filestreams allocation mode across the entire filesystem
rather than just on directories configured to use it.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>ikeep</b>|<b>noikeep</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">When ikeep is specified, XFS
does not delete empty inode clusters and keeps them around
on disk. When noikeep is specified, empty inode clusters are
returned to the free space pool. noikeep is the default.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>inode32</b>|<b>inode64</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">When inode32 is specified, it
indicates that XFS limits inode creation to locations which
will not result in inode numbers with more than 32 bits of
significance.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">When inode64 is
specified, it indicates that XFS is allowed to create inodes
at any location in the filesystem, including those which
will result in inode numbers occupying more than 32 bits of
significance.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">inode32 is
provided for backwards compatibility with older systems and
applications, since 64 bits inode numbers might cause
problems for some applications that cannot handle large
inode numbers. If applications are in use which do not
handle inode numbers bigger than 32 bits, the inode32 option
should be specified.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">For kernel v3.7
and later, inode64 is the default.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>largeio</b>|<b>nolargeio</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If &quot;nolargeio&quot; is
specified, the optimal I/O reported in st_blksize by stat(2)
will be as small as possible to allow user applications to
avoid inefficient read/modify/write I/O. This is typically
the page size of the machine, as this is the granularity of
the page cache.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If
&quot;largeio&quot; specified, a filesystem that was created
with a &quot;swidth&quot; specified will return the
&quot;swidth&quot; value (in bytes) in st_blksize. If the
filesystem does not have a &quot;swidth&quot; specified but
does specify an &quot;allocsize&quot; then
&quot;allocsize&quot; (in bytes) will be returned instead.
Otherwise the behavior is the same as if
&quot;nolargeio&quot; was specified. nolargeio is the
default.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>logbufs=value</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set the number of in-memory log
buffers. Valid numbers range from 2&ndash;8 inclusive.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The default
value is 8 buffers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If the memory
cost of 8 log buffers is too high on small systems, then it
may be reduced at some cost to performance on metadata
intensive workloads. The logbsize option below controls the
size of each buffer and so is also relevant to this
case.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>logbsize=value</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set the size of each in-memory
log buffer. The size may be specified in bytes, or in
kibibytes (KiB) with a &quot;k&quot; suffix. Valid sizes for
version 1 and version 2 logs are 16384 (value=16k) and 32768
(value=32k). Valid sizes for version 2 logs also include
65536 (value=64k), 131072 (value=128k) and 262144
(value=256k). The logbsize must be an integer multiple of
the log stripe unit configured at mkfs time.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The default
value for version 1 logs is 32768, while the default value
for version 2 logs is MAX(32768, log_sunit).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>logdev=device</b>and<b>rtdev=device</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Use an external log (metadata
journal) and/or real-time device. An XFS filesystem has up
to three parts: a data section, a log section, and a
real-time section. The real-time section is optional, and
the log section can be separate from the data section or
contained within it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>noalign</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Data allocations will not be
aligned at stripe unit boundaries. This is only relevant to
filesystems created with non-zero data alignment parameters
(sunit, swidth) by mkfs.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>norecovery</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The filesystem will be mounted
without running log recovery. If the filesystem was not
cleanly unmounted, it is likely to be inconsistent when
mounted in &quot;norecovery&quot; mode. Some files or
directories may not be accessible because of this.
Filesystems mounted &quot;norecovery&quot; must be mounted
read-only or the mount will fail.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>noquota</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Forcibly turns off all quota
accounting and enforcement within the filesystem.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>uquota/usrquota/uqnoenforce/quota</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">User disk quota accounting
enabled, and limits (optionally) enforced. Refer to
xfs_quota(8) for further details.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>gquota/grpquota/gqnoenforce</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Group disk quota accounting
enabled and limits (optionally) enforced. Refer to
xfs_quota(8) for further details.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>pquota/prjquota/pqnoenforce</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Project disk quota accounting
enabled and limits (optionally) enforced. Refer to
xfs_quota(8) for further details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>sunit=value</b> and
<b>swidth=value</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Used to specify the stripe unit
and width for a RAID device or a stripe volume.
&quot;value&quot; must be specified in 512-byte block units.
These options are only relevant to filesystems that were
created with non-zero data alignment parameters.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The sunit and
swidth parameters specified must be compatible with the
existing filesystem alignment characteristics. In general,
that means the only valid changes to sunit are increasing it
by a power-of-2 multiple. Valid swidth values are any
integer multiple of a valid sunit value.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Typically the
only time these mount options are necessary if after an
underlying RAID device has had it&rsquo;s geometry modified,
such as adding a new disk to a RAID5 lun and reshaping
it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>swalloc</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Data allocations will be
rounded up to stripe width boundaries when the current end
of file is being extended and the file size is larger than
the stripe width size.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

<p><b>wsync</b></p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>When specified, all filesystem namespace operations are
executed synchronously. This ensures that when the namespace
operation (create, unlink, etc) completes, the change to the
namespace is on stable storage. This is useful in HA setups
where failover must not result in clients seeing
inconsistent namespace presentation during or after a
failover event.</p></td></tr>
