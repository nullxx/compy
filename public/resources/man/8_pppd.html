Point-to-Point Protocol Daemon</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>pppd</b> [
<i>options</i> ]</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">PPP is the
protocol used for establishing internet links over dial-up
modems, DSL connections, and many other types of
point-to-point links. The <i>pppd</i> daemon works together
with the kernel PPP driver to establish and maintain a PPP
link with another system (called the <i>peer</i>) and to
negotiate Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for each end of
the link. Pppd can also authenticate the peer and/or supply
authentication information to the peer. PPP can be used with
other network protocols besides IP, but such use is becoming
increasingly rare.</p>

<h2>FREQUENTLY USED OPTIONS
<a name="FREQUENTLY USED OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>ttyname</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Use the serial port called
<i>ttyname</i> to communicate with the peer. If
<i>ttyname</i> does not begin with a slash (/), the string
&quot;/dev/&quot; is prepended to <i>ttyname</i> to form the
name of the device to open. If no device name is given, or
if the name of the terminal connected to the standard input
is given, pppd will use that terminal, and will not fork to
put itself in the background. A value for this option from a
privileged source cannot be overridden by a non-privileged
user.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="7%">


<p><i>speed</i></p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>An option that is a decimal number is taken as the
desired baud rate for the serial device. On systems such as
4.4BSD and NetBSD, any speed can be specified. Other systems
(e.g. Linux, SunOS) only support the commonly-used baud
rates.</p> </td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>asyncmap</b> <i>map</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This option sets the
Async-Control-Character-Map (ACCM) for this end of the link.
The ACCM is a set of 32 bits, one for each of the ASCII
control characters with values from 0 to 31, where a 1 bit
indicates that the corresponding control character should
not be used in PPP packets sent to this system. The map is
encoded as a hexadecimal number (without a leading 0x) where
the least significant bit (00000001) represents character 0
and the most significant bit (80000000) represents character
31. Pppd will ask the peer to send these characters as a
2-byte escape sequence. If multiple <i>asyncmap</i> options
are given, the values are ORed together. If no
<i>asyncmap</i> option is given, the default is zero, so
pppd will ask the peer not to escape any control characters.
To escape transmitted characters, use the <i>escape</i>
option.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="6%">


<p><b>auth</b></p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>Require the peer to authenticate itself before allowing
network packets to be sent or received. This option is the
default if the system has a default route. If neither this
option nor the <i>noauth</i> option is specified, pppd will
only allow the peer to use IP addresses to which the system
does not already have a route.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>call</b> <i>name</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Read additional options from
the file /etc/ppp/peers/<i>name</i>. This file may contain
privileged options, such as <i>noauth</i>, even if pppd is
not being run by root. The <i>name</i> string may not begin
with / or include .. as a pathname component. The format of
the options file is described below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>connect</b>
<i>script</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Usually there is something
which needs to be done to prepare the link before the PPP
protocol can be started; for instance, with a dial-up modem,
commands need to be sent to the modem to dial the
appropriate phone number. This option specifies an command
for pppd to execute (by passing it to a shell) before
attempting to start PPP negotiation. The chat (8) program is
often useful here, as it provides a way to send arbitrary
strings to a modem and respond to received characters. A
value for this option from a privileged source cannot be
overridden by a non-privileged user.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>crtscts</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specifies that pppd should set
the serial port to use hardware flow control using the RTS
and CTS signals in the RS-232 interface. If neither the
<i>crtscts</i>, the <i>nocrtscts</i>, the <i>cdtrcts</i> nor
the <i>nocdtrcts</i> option is given, the hardware flow
control setting for the serial port is left unchanged. Some
serial ports (such as Macintosh serial ports) lack a true
RTS output. Such serial ports use this mode to implement
unidirectional flow control. The serial port will suspend
transmission when requested by the modem (via CTS) but will
be unable to request the modem to stop sending to the
computer. This mode retains the ability to use DTR as a
modem control line.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>defaultroute</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Add a default route to the
system routing tables, using the peer as the gateway, when
IPCP negotiation is successfully completed. This entry is
removed when the PPP connection is broken. This option is
privileged if the <i>nodefaultroute</i> option has been
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>disconnect</b>
<i>script</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Execute the command specified
by <i>script</i>, by passing it to a shell, after pppd has
terminated the link. This command could, for example, issue
commands to the modem to cause it to hang up if hardware
modem control signals were not available. The disconnect
script is not run if the modem has already hung up. A value
for this option from a privileged source cannot be
overridden by a non-privileged user.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>escape</b>
<i>xx,yy,...</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specifies that certain
characters should be escaped on transmission (regardless of
whether the peer requests them to be escaped with its async
control character map). The characters to be escaped are
specified as a list of hex numbers separated by commas. Note
that almost any character can be specified for the
<i>escape</i> option, unlike the <i>asyncmap</i> option
which only allows control characters to be specified. The
characters which may not be escaped are those with hex
values 0x20 - 0x3f or 0x5e.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>file</b> <i>name</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Read options from file
<i>name</i> (the format is described below). The file must
be readable by the user who has invoked pppd.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>init</b> <i>script</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Execute the command specified
by <i>script</i>, by passing it to a shell, to initialize
the serial line. This script would typically use the chat(8)
program to configure the modem to enable auto answer. A
value for this option from a privileged source cannot be
overridden by a non-privileged user.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="7%">


<p><b>lock</b></p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>Specifies that pppd should create a UUCP-style lock file
for the serial device to ensure exclusive access to the
device. By default, pppd will not create a lock file.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="7%">


<p><b>mru</b> <i>n</i></p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>Set the MRU [Maximum Receive Unit] value to <i>n</i>.
Pppd will ask the peer to send packets of no more than
<i>n</i> bytes. The value of <i>n</i> must be between 128
and 16384; the default is 1500. A value of 296 works well on
very slow links (40 bytes for TCP/IP header + 256 bytes of
data). Note that for the IPv6 protocol, the MRU must be at
least 1280.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="7%">


<p><b>mtu</b> <i>n</i></p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>Set the MTU [Maximum Transmit Unit] value to <i>n</i>.
Unless the peer requests a smaller value via MRU
negotiation, pppd will request that the kernel networking
code send data packets of no more than <i>n</i> bytes
through the PPP network interface. Note that for the IPv6
protocol, the MTU must be at least 1280.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>passive</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Enables the &quot;passive&quot;
option in the LCP. With this option, pppd will attempt to
initiate a connection; if no reply is received from the
peer, pppd will then just wait passively for a valid LCP
packet from the peer, instead of exiting, as it would
without this option.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>&lt;local_IP_address&gt;</i><b>:</b><i>&lt;remote_IP_address&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set the local and/or remote
interface IP addresses. Either one may be omitted. The IP
addresses can be specified with a host name or in decimal
dot notation (e.g. 150.234.56.78). The default local address
is the (first) IP address of the system (unless the
<i>noipdefault</i> option is given). The remote address will
be obtained from the peer if not specified in any option.
Thus, in simple cases, this option is not required. If a
local and/or remote IP address is specified with this
option, pppd will not accept a different value from the peer
in the IPCP negotiation, unless the
<i>ipcp&minus;accept&minus;local</i> and/or
<i>ipcp&minus;accept&minus;remote</i> options are given,
respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>ipv6</b>
<i>&lt;local_interface_identifier&gt;</i>,<i>&lt;remote_interface_identifier&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set the local and/or remote
64-bit interface identifier. Either one may be omitted. The
identifier must be specified in standard ASCII notation of
IPv6 addresses (e.g. ::dead:beef). If the
<i>ipv6cp&minus;use&minus;ipaddr</i> option is given, the
local identifier is the local IPv4 address (see above). On
systems which supports a unique persistent id, such as
EUI&minus;48 derived from the Ethernet MAC address,
<i>ipv6cp&minus;use&minus;persistent</i> option can be used
to replace the <i>ipv6 &lt;local&gt;,&lt;remote&gt;</i>
option. Otherwise the identifier is randomized.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>active&minus;filter</b>
<i>filter&minus;expression</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specifies a packet filter to be
applied to data packets to determine which packets are to be
regarded as link activity, and therefore reset the idle
timer, or cause the link to be brought up in demand-dialling
mode. This option is useful in conjunction with the
<b>idle</b> option if there are packets being sent or
received regularly over the link (for example, routing
information packets) which would otherwise prevent the link
from ever appearing to be idle. The
<i>filter&minus;expression</i> syntax is as described for
tcpdump(1), except that qualifiers which are inappropriate
for a PPP link, such as <b>ether</b> and <b>arp</b>, are not
permitted. Generally the filter expression should be
enclosed in single-quotes to prevent whitespace in the
expression from being interpreted by the shell. This option
is currently only available under Linux, and requires that
the kernel was configured to include PPP filtering support
(CONFIG_PPP_FILTER). Note that it is possible to apply
different constraints to incoming and outgoing packets using
the <b>inbound</b> and <b>outbound</b> qualifiers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>allow&minus;ip</b>
<i>address(es)</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Allow peers to use the given IP
address or subnet without authenticating themselves. The
parameter is parsed as for each element of the list of
allowed IP addresses in the secrets files (see the
AUTHENTICATION section below).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>allow&minus;number</b>
<i>number</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Allow peers to connect from the
given telephone number. A trailing &lsquo;*&rsquo; character
will match all numbers beginning with the leading part.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>bsdcomp</b> <i>nr,nt</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Request that the peer compress
packets that it sends, using the BSD-Compress scheme, with a
maximum code size of <i>nr</i> bits, and agree to compress
packets sent to the peer with a maximum code size of
<i>nt</i> bits. If <i>nt</i> is not specified, it defaults
to the value given for <i>nr</i>. Values in the range 9 to
15 may be used for <i>nr</i> and <i>nt</i>; larger values
give better compression but consume more kernel memory for
compression dictionaries. Alternatively, a value of 0 for
<i>nr</i> or <i>nt</i> disables compression in the
corresponding direction. Use <i>nobsdcomp</i> or <i>bsdcomp
0</i> to disable BSD-Compress compression entirely.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>cdtrcts</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Use a non-standard hardware
flow control (i.e. DTR/CTS) to control the flow of data on
the serial port. If neither the <i>crtscts</i>, the
<i>nocrtscts</i>, the <i>cdtrcts</i> nor the
<i>nocdtrcts</i> option is given, the hardware flow control
setting for the serial port is left unchanged. Some serial
ports (such as Macintosh serial ports) lack a true RTS
output. Such serial ports use this mode to implement true
bi-directional flow control. The sacrifice is that this flow
control mode does not permit using DTR as a modem control
line.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>chap&minus;interval</b>
<i>n</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If this option is given, pppd
will rechallenge the peer every <i>n</i> seconds.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>chap&minus;max&minus;challenge</b>
<i>n</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set the maximum number of CHAP
challenge transmissions to <i>n</i> (default 10).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>chap&minus;restart</b>
<i>n</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set the CHAP restart interval
(retransmission timeout for challenges) to <i>n</i> seconds
(default 3).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>child&minus;timeout</b>
<i>n</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">When exiting, wait for up to
<i>n</i> seconds for any child processes (such as the
command specified with the <b>pty</b> command) to exit
before exiting. At the end of the timeout, pppd will send a
SIGTERM signal to any remaining child processes and exit. A
value of 0 means no timeout, that is, pppd will wait until
all child processes have exited.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>connect&minus;delay</b>
<i>n</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Wait for up to <i>n</i>
milliseconds after the connect script finishes for a valid
PPP packet from the peer. At the end of this time, or when a
valid PPP packet is received from the peer, pppd will
commence negotiation by sending its first LCP packet. The
default value is 1000 (1 second). This wait period only
applies if the <b>connect</b> or <b>pty</b> option is
used.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="7%">


<p><b>debug</b></p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>Enables connection debugging facilities. If this option
is given, pppd will log the contents of all control packets
sent or received in a readable form. The packets are logged
through syslog with facility <i>daemon</i> and level
<i>debug</i>. This information can be directed to a file by
setting up /etc/syslog.conf appropriately (see
syslog.conf(5)).</p> </td></tr>
</table>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>default&minus;asyncmap</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Disable asyncmap negotiation,
forcing all control characters to be escaped for both the
transmit and the receive direction.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>default&minus;mru</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Disable MRU [Maximum Receive
Unit] negotiation. With this option, pppd will use the
default MRU value of 1500 bytes for both the transmit and
receive direction.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>deflate</b> <i>nr,nt</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Request that the peer compress
packets that it sends, using the Deflate scheme, with a
maximum window size of <i>2**nr</i> bytes, and agree to
compress packets sent to the peer with a maximum window size
of <i>2**nt</i> bytes. If <i>nt</i> is not specified, it
defaults to the value given for <i>nr</i>. Values in the
range 9 to 15 may be used for <i>nr</i> and <i>nt</i>;
larger values give better compression but consume more
kernel memory for compression dictionaries. Alternatively, a
value of 0 for <i>nr</i> or <i>nt</i> disables compression
in the corresponding direction. Use <i>nodeflate</i> or
<i>deflate 0</i> to disable Deflate compression entirely.
(Note: pppd requests Deflate compression in preference to
BSD-Compress if the peer can do either.)</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="9%">


<p><b>demand</b></p></td>
<td width="2%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>Initiate the link only on demand, i.e. when data traffic
is present. With this option, the remote IP address must be
specified by the user on the command line or in an options
file. Pppd will initially configure the interface and enable
it for IP traffic without connecting to the peer. When
traffic is available, pppd will connect to the peer and
perform negotiation, authentication, etc. When this is
completed, pppd will commence passing data packets (i.e., IP
packets) across the link.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>demand</i> option implies the <i>persist</i> option. If
this behaviour is not desired, use the <i>nopersist</i>
option after the <i>demand</i> option. The <i>idle</i> and
<i>holdoff</i> options are also useful in conjunction with
the <i>demand</i> option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>domain</b> <i>d</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Append the domain name <i>d</i>
to the local host name for authentication purposes. For
example, if gethostname() returns the name porsche, but the
fully qualified domain name is porsche.Quotron.COM, you
could specify <i>domain Quotron.COM</i>. Pppd would then use
the name <i>porsche.Quotron.COM</i> for looking up secrets
in the secrets file, and as the default name to send to the
peer when authenticating itself to the peer. This option is
privileged.</p>

<p><b>dryrun</b></p></td>
<td width="2%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>With the <b>dryrun</b> option, pppd will print out all
the option values which have been set and then exit, after
parsing the command line and options files and checking the
option values, but before initiating the link. The option
values are logged at level info, and also printed to
standard output unless the device on standard output is the
device that pppd would be using to communicate with the
peer.</p> </td></tr>

<p><b>dump</b></p></td>
<td width="2%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>With the <b>dump</b> option, pppd will print out all the
option values which have been set. This option is like the
<b>dryrun</b> option except that pppd proceeds as normal
rather than exiting.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>enable-session</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Enables session accounting via
PAM or wtwp/wtmpx, as appropriate. When PAM is enabled, the
PAM &quot;account&quot; and &quot;session&quot; module
stacks determine behavior, and are enabled for all PPP
authentication protocols. When PAM is disabled, wtmp/wtmpx
entries are recorded regardless of whether the peer name
identifies a valid user on the local system, making peers
visible in the last(1) log. This feature is automatically
enabled when the pppd <b>login</b> option is used. Session
accounting is disabled by default.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>endpoint</b>
<i>&lt;epdisc&gt;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Sets the endpoint discriminator
sent by the local machine to the peer during multilink
negotiation to <i>&lt;epdisc&gt;</i>. The default is to use
the MAC address of the first ethernet interface on the
system, if any, otherwise the IPv4 address corresponding to
the hostname, if any, provided it is not in the multicast or
locally-assigned IP address ranges, or the localhost
address. The endpoint discriminator can be the string
<b>null</b> or of the form <i>type</i>:<i>value</i>, where
type is a decimal number or one of the strings <b>local</b>,
<b>IP</b>, <b>MAC</b>, <b>magic</b>, or <b>phone</b>. The
value is an IP address in dotted-decimal notation for the
<b>IP</b> type, or a string of bytes in hexadecimal,
separated by periods or colons for the other types. For the
MAC type, the value may also be the name of an ethernet or
similar network interface. This option is currently only
available under Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>eap&minus;interval</b>
<i>n</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If this option is given and
pppd authenticates the peer with EAP (i.e., is the server),
pppd will restart EAP authentication every <i>n</i> seconds.
For EAP SRP&minus;SHA1, see also the
<b>srp&minus;interval</b> option, which enables lightweight
rechallenge.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>eap&minus;max&minus;rreq</b>
<i>n</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set the maximum number of EAP
Requests to which pppd will respond (as a client) without
hearing EAP Success or Failure. (Default is 20.)</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>eap&minus;max&minus;sreq</b>
<i>n</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set the maximum number of EAP
Requests that pppd will issue (as a server) while attempting
authentication. (Default is 10.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>eap&minus;restart</b>
<i>n</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set the retransmit timeout for
EAP Requests when acting as a server (authenticator).
(Default is 3 seconds.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>eap&minus;timeout</b>
<i>n</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set the maximum time to wait
for the peer to send an EAP Request when acting as a client
(authenticatee). (Default is 20 seconds.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>hide&minus;password</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">When logging the contents of
PAP packets, this option causes pppd to exclude the password
string from the log. This is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>holdoff</b> <i>n</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specifies how many seconds to
wait before re-initiating the link after it terminates. This
option only has any effect if the <i>persist</i> or
<i>demand</i> option is used. The holdoff period is not
applied if the link was terminated because it was idle.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"

<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>

<p><b>idle</b> <i>n</i></p></td>
<td width="2%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>Specifies that pppd should disconnect if the link is
idle for <i>n</i> seconds. The link is idle when no data
packets (i.e. IP packets) are being sent or received. Note:
it is not advisable to use this option with the
<i>persist</i> option without the <i>demand</i> option. If
the <b>active&minus;filter</b> option is given, data packets
which are rejected by the specified activity filter also
count as the link being idle.</p></td></tr>
</table>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>ipcp&minus;accept&minus;local</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">With this option, pppd will
accept the peer&rsquo;s idea of our local IP address, even
if the local IP address was specified in an option.</p>

transmit characters on its standard output and receive
characters on its standard input even if they are not
terminal devices. This option increases the latency and CPU
overhead of transferring data over the ppp interface as all
of the characters sent and received must flow through the
character shunt process. An explicit device name may not be
given if this option is used.</p></td></tr>

headers, nor ask the peer to do so.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>papcrypt</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Indicates that all secrets in
the /etc/ppp/pap&minus;secrets file which are used for

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>pass&minus;filter</b>
<i>filter&minus;expression</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specifies a packet filter to
applied to data packets being sent or received to determine
which packets should be allowed to pass. Packets which are
rejected by the filter are silently discarded. This option
can be used to prevent specific network daemons (such as
routed) using up link bandwidth, or to provide a very basic
firewall capability. The <i>filter&minus;expression</i>
syntax is as described for tcpdump(1), except that
qualifiers which are inappropriate for a PPP link, such as
<b>ether</b> and <b>arp</b>, are not permitted. Generally
the filter expression should be enclosed in single-quotes to
prevent whitespace in the expression from being interpreted
by the shell. Note that it is possible to apply different
constraints to incoming and outgoing packets using the
<b>inbound</b> and <b>outbound</b> qualifiers. This option
is currently only available under Linux, and requires that
the kernel was configured to include PPP filtering support
(CONFIG_PPP_FILTER).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>password</b>
<i>password&minus;string</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specifies the password to use
for authenticating to the peer. Use of this option is
discouraged, as the password is likely to be visible to
other users on the system (for example, by using ps(1)).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>persist</b></p>

<i>filename</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Load the shared library object
file <i>filename</i> as a plugin. This is a privileged

pppd will look in the <b>/usr/lib/pppd/</b><i>version</i>
directory for the plugin, where <i>version</i> is the
version number of pppd (for example, 2.4.2).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>predictor1</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Request that the peer compress
frames that it sends using Predictor-1 compression, and
agree to compress transmitted frames with Predictor-1 if
requested. This option has no effect unless the kernel
driver supports Predictor-1 compression.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>privgroup</b>
<i>group&minus;name</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Allows members of group
<i>group&minus;name</i> to use privileged options. This is a
privileged option. Use of this option requires care as there
is no guarantee that members of <i>group&minus;name</i>
cannot use pppd to become root themselves. Consider it
equivalent to putting the members of <i>group&minus;name</i>
in the kmem or disk group.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>proxyarp</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Add an entry to this
system&rsquo;s ARP [Address Resolution Protocol] table with
the IP address of the peer and the Ethernet address of this
system. This will have the effect of making the peer appear
to other systems to be on the local ethernet.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>pty</b> <i>script</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specifies that the command
<i>script</i> is to be used to communicate rather than a
specific terminal device. Pppd will allocate itself a
pseudo-tty master/slave pair and use the slave as its
terminal device. The <i>script</i> will be run in a child
process with the pseudo-tty master as its standard input and
output. An explicit device name may not be given if this
option is used. (Note: if the <i>record</i> option is used
in conjunction with the <i>pty</i> option, the child process
will have pipes on its standard input and output.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>receive&minus;all</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">With this option, pppd will
accept all control characters from the peer, including those
marked in the receive asyncmap. Without this option, pppd
will discard those characters as specified in RFC1662. This
option should only be needed if the peer is buggy.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>record</b>
<i>filename</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specifies that pppd should
record all characters sent and received to a file named
<i>filename</i>. This file is opened in append mode, using
the user&rsquo;s user-ID and permissions. This option is
implemented using a pseudo-tty and a process to transfer
characters between the pseudo-tty and the real serial
device, so it will increase the latency and CPU overhead of
transferring data over the ppp interface. The characters are
stored in a tagged format with timestamps, which can be
displayed in readable form using the pppdump(8) program.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>require&minus;mppe</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Require the use of MPPE
(Microsoft Point to Point Encryption). This option disables
all other compression types. This option enables both 40-bit
and 128-bit encryption. In order for MPPE to successfully
come up, you must have authenticated with either

<i>n</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If this parameter is given and
pppd uses EAP SRP&minus;SHA1 to authenticate the peer (i.e.,
is the server), then pppd will use the optional lightweight
SRP rechallenge mechanism at intervals of <i>n</i> seconds.
This option is faster than <b>eap&minus;interval</b>
reauthentication because it uses a hash&minus;based
mechanism and does not derive a new session key.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>srp&minus;pn&minus;secret</b>
<i>string</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set the long-term
pseudonym-generating secret for the server. This value is
optional and if set, needs to be known at the server
(authenticator) side only, and should be different for each
server (or poll of identical servers). It is used along with
the current date to generate a key to encrypt and decrypt
the client&rsquo;s identity contained in the pseudonym.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>srp&minus;use&minus;pseudonym</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">When operating as an EAP

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>usehostname</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Enforce the use of the hostname
(with domain name appended, if given) as the name of the

since the <i>name</i> option is privileged.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>usepeerdns</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Ask the peer for up to 2 DNS
server addresses. The addresses supplied by the peer (if
any) are passed to the /etc/ppp/ip&minus;up script in the
environment variables DNS1 and DNS2, and the environment
variable USEPEERDNS will be set to 1. In addition, pppd will

cannot be overridden by a non-privileged user.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>xonxoff</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Use software flow control (i.e.

<h2>OPTIONS FILES
<a name="OPTIONS FILES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Options can be
taken from files as well as the command line. Pppd reads
options from the files /etc/ppp/options, ~/.ppprc and
/etc/ppp/options.<i>ttyname</i> (in that order) before
processing the options on the command line. (In fact, the
command-line options are scanned to find the terminal name
before the options.<i>ttyname</i> file is read.) In forming
the name of the options.<i>ttyname</i> file, the initial
/dev/ is removed from the terminal name, and any remaining /
characters are replaced with dots.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">An options file
is parsed into a series of words, delimited by whitespace.
Whitespace can be included in a word by enclosing the word
in double-quotes (&quot;). A backslash (\) quotes the
following character. A hash (#) starts a comment, which
continues until the end of the line. There is no restriction
on using the <i>file</i> or <i>call</i> options within an
options file.</p>

<h2>SECURITY
<a name="SECURITY"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>pppd</i>
provides system administrators with sufficient access
control that PPP access to a server machine can be provided
to legitimate users without fear of compromising the
security of the server or the network it&rsquo;s on. This
control is provided through restrictions on which IP
addresses the peer may use, based on its authenticated
identity (if any), and through restrictions on which options
a non-privileged user may use. Several of pppd&rsquo;s
options are privileged, in particular those which permit
potentially insecure configurations; these options are only
accepted in files which are under the control of the system
administrator, or if pppd is being run by root.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The default
behaviour of pppd is to allow an unauthenticated peer to use
a given IP address only if the system does not already have
a route to that IP address. For example, a system with a
permanent connection to the wider internet will normally
have a default route, and thus all peers will have to
authenticate themselves in order to set up a connection. On
such a system, the <i>auth</i> option is the default. On the
other hand, a system where the PPP link is the only
connection to the internet will not normally have a default
route, so the peer will be able to use almost any IP address
without authenticating itself.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As indicated
above, some security-sensitive options are privileged, which
means that they may not be used by an ordinary
non-privileged user running a setuid-root pppd, either on
the command line, in the user&rsquo;s ~/.ppprc file, or in
an options file read using the <i>file</i> option.
Privileged options may be used in /etc/ppp/options file or
in an options file read using the <i>call</i> option. If
pppd is being run by the root user, privileged options can
be used without restriction.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When opening
the device, pppd uses either the invoking user&rsquo;s user
ID or the root UID (that is, 0), depending on whether the
device name was specified by the user or the system
administrator. If the device name comes from a privileged
source, that is, /etc/ppp/options or an options file read
using the <i>call</i> option, pppd uses full root privileges
when opening the device. Thus, by creating an appropriate
file under /etc/ppp/peers, the system administrator can
allow users to establish a ppp connection via a device which
they would not normally have permission to access. Otherwise
pppd uses the invoking user&rsquo;s real UID when opening
the device.</p>

<h2>AUTHENTICATION
<a name="AUTHENTICATION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Authentication
is the process whereby one peer convinces the other of its
identity. This involves the first peer sending its name to
the other, together with some kind of secret information
which could only come from the genuine authorized user of
that name. In such an exchange, we will call the first peer
the &quot;client&quot; and the other the &quot;server&quot;.
The client has a name by which it identifies itself to the
server, and the server also has a name by which it
identifies itself to the client. Generally the genuine
client shares some secret (or password) with the server, and
authenticates itself by proving that it knows that secret.
Very often, the names used for authentication correspond to
the internet hostnames of the peers, but this is not
essential.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">At present,
pppd supports three authentication protocols: the Password
Authentication Protocol (PAP), Challenge Handshake
Authentication Protocol (CHAP), and Extensible
Authentication Protocol (EAP). PAP involves the client
sending its name and a cleartext password to the server to
authenticate itself. In contrast, the server initiates the
CHAP authentication exchange by sending a challenge to the
client (the challenge packet includes the server&rsquo;s
name). The client must respond with a response which
includes its name plus a hash value derived from the shared
secret and the challenge, in order to prove that it knows
the secret. EAP supports CHAP-style authentication, and also
includes the SRP&minus;SHA1 mechanism, which is resistant to
dictionary-based attacks and does not require a cleartext
password on the server side.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The PPP
protocol, being symmetrical, allows both peers to require
the other to authenticate itself. In that case, two separate
and independent authentication exchanges will occur. The two
exchanges could use different authentication protocols, and
in principle, different names could be used in the two
exchanges.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The default
behaviour of pppd is to agree to authenticate if requested,
and to not require authentication from the peer. However,
pppd will not agree to authenticate itself with a particular
protocol if it has no secrets which could be used to do
so.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Pppd stores
secrets for use in authentication in secrets files
(/etc/ppp/pap&minus;secrets for PAP,
/etc/ppp/chap&minus;secrets for CHAP, MS&minus;CHAP,
MS&minus;CHAPv2, and EAP MD5-Challenge, and
/etc/ppp/srp&minus;secrets for EAP SRP&minus;SHA1). All
secrets files have the same format. The secrets files can
contain secrets for pppd to use in authenticating itself to
other systems, as well as secrets for pppd to use when
authenticating other systems to itself.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Each line in a
secrets file contains one secret. A given secret is specific
to a particular combination of client and server - it can
only be used by that client to authenticate itself to that
server. Thus each line in a secrets file has at least 3
fields: the name of the client, the name of the server, and
the secret. These fields may be followed by a list of the IP
addresses that the specified client may use when connecting
to the specified server.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A secrets file
is parsed into words as for a options file, so the client
name, server name and secrets fields must each be one word,
with any embedded spaces or other special characters quoted
or escaped. Note that case is significant in the client and
server names and in the secret.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the secret
starts with an &lsquo;@&rsquo;, what follows is assumed to
be the name of a file from which to read the secret. A
&quot;*&quot; as the client or server name matches any name.
When selecting a secret, pppd takes the best match, i.e. the
match with the fewest wildcards.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Any following
words on the same line are taken to be a list of acceptable
IP addresses for that client. If there are only 3 words on
the line, or if the first word is &quot;&minus;&quot;, then
all IP addresses are disallowed. To allow any address, use
&quot;*&quot;. A word starting with &quot;!&quot; indicates
that the specified address is <i>not</i> acceptable. An
address may be followed by &quot;/&quot; and a number
<i>n</i>, to indicate a whole subnet, i.e. all addresses
which have the same value in the most significant <i>n</i>
bits. In this form, the address may be followed by a plus
sign (&quot;+&quot;) to indicate that one address from the
subnet is authorized, based on the ppp network interface
unit number in use. In this case, the host part of the
address will be set to the unit number plus one.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Thus a secrets
file contains both secrets for use in authenticating other
hosts, plus secrets which we use for authenticating
ourselves to others. When pppd is authenticating the peer
(checking the peer&rsquo;s identity), it chooses a secret
with the peer&rsquo;s name in the first field and the name
of the local system in the second field. The name of the
local system defaults to the hostname, with the domain name
appended if the <i>domain</i> option is used. This default
can be overridden with the <i>name</i> option, except when
the <i>usehostname</i> option is used. (For EAP
SRP&minus;SHA1, see the srp&minus;entry(8) utility for
generating proper validator entries to be used in the
&quot;secret&quot; field.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When pppd is
choosing a secret to use in authenticating itself to the
peer, it first determines what name it is going to use to
identify itself to the peer. This name can be specified by
the user with the <i>user</i> option. If this option is not
used, the name defaults to the name of the local system,
determined as described in the previous paragraph. Then pppd
looks for a secret with this name in the first field and the
peer&rsquo;s name in the second field. Pppd will know the
name of the peer if CHAP or EAP authentication is being
used, because the peer will have sent it in the challenge
packet. However, if PAP is being used, pppd will have to
determine the peer&rsquo;s name from the options specified
by the user. The user can specify the peer&rsquo;s name
directly with the <i>remotename</i> option. Otherwise, if
the remote IP address was specified by a name (rather than
in numeric form), that name will be used as the peer&rsquo;s
name. Failing that, pppd will use the null string as the
peer&rsquo;s name.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When
authenticating the peer with PAP, the supplied password is
first compared with the secret from the secrets file. If the
password doesn&rsquo;t match the secret, the password is
encrypted using crypt() and checked against the secret
again. Thus secrets for authenticating the peer can be
stored in encrypted form if desired. If the <i>papcrypt</i>
option is given, the first (unencrypted) comparison is
omitted, for better security.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Furthermore, if
the <i>login</i> option was specified, the username and
password are also checked against the system password
database. Thus, the system administrator can set up the
pap&minus;secrets file to allow PPP access only to certain
users, and to restrict the set of IP addresses that each
user can use. Typically, when using the <i>login</i> option,
the secret in /etc/ppp/pap&minus;secrets would be
&quot;&quot;, which will match any password supplied by the
peer. This avoids the need to have the same secret in two
places.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Authentication
must be satisfactorily completed before IPCP (or any other
Network Control Protocol) can be started. If the peer is
required to authenticate itself, and fails to do so, pppd
will terminated the link (by closing LCP). If IPCP
negotiates an unacceptable IP address for the remote host,
IPCP will be closed. IP packets can only be sent or received
when IPCP is open.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In some cases
it is desirable to allow some hosts which can&rsquo;t
authenticate themselves to connect and use one of a
restricted set of IP addresses, even when the local host
generally requires authentication. If the peer refuses to
authenticate itself when requested, pppd takes that as
equivalent to authenticating with PAP using the empty string
for the username and password. Thus, by adding a line to the
pap&minus;secrets file which specifies the empty string for
the client and password, it is possible to allow restricted
access to hosts which refuse to authenticate themselves.</p>

<h2>ROUTING
<a name="ROUTING"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When IPCP
negotiation is completed successfully, pppd will inform the
kernel of the local and remote IP addresses for the ppp
interface. This is sufficient to create a host route to the
remote end of the link, which will enable the peers to
exchange IP packets. Communication with other machines
generally requires further modification to routing tables
and/or ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) tables. In most
cases the <i>defaultroute</i> and/or <i>proxyarp</i> options
are sufficient for this, but in some cases further
intervention is required. The /etc/ppp/ip&minus;up script
can be used for this.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Sometimes it is
desirable to add a default route through the remote host, as
in the case of a machine whose only connection to the
Internet is through the ppp interface. The
<i>defaultroute</i> option causes pppd to create such a
default route when IPCP comes up, and delete it when the
link is terminated.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In some cases
it is desirable to use proxy ARP, for example on a server
machine connected to a LAN, in order to allow other hosts to
communicate with the remote host. The <i>proxyarp</i> option
causes pppd to look for a network interface on the same
subnet as the remote host (an interface supporting broadcast
and ARP, which is up and not a point-to-point or loopback
interface). If found, pppd creates a permanent, published
ARP entry with the IP address of the remote host and the
hardware address of the network interface found.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When the
<i>demand</i> option is used, the interface IP addresses
have already been set at the point when IPCP comes up. If
pppd has not been able to negotiate the same addresses that
it used to configure the interface (for example when the
peer is an ISP that uses dynamic IP address assignment),
pppd has to change the interface IP addresses to the
negotiated addresses. This may disrupt existing connections,
and the use of demand dialling with peers that do dynamic IP
address assignment is not recommended.</p>

<h2>MULTILINK
<a name="MULTILINK"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Multilink PPP
provides the capability to combine two or more PPP links
between a pair of machines into a single
&lsquo;bundle&rsquo;, which appears as a single virtual PPP
link which has the combined bandwidth of the individual
links. Currently, multilink PPP is only supported under
Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Pppd detects
that the link it is controlling is connected to the same
peer as another link using the peer&rsquo;s endpoint
discriminator and the authenticated identity of the peer (if
it authenticates itself). The endpoint discriminator is a
block of data which is hopefully unique for each peer.
Several types of data can be used, including
locally-assigned strings of bytes, IP addresses, MAC
addresses, randomly strings of bytes, or E&minus;164 phone
numbers. The endpoint discriminator sent to the peer by pppd
can be set using the endpoint option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In some
circumstances the peer may send no endpoint discriminator or
a non-unique value. The bundle option adds an extra string
which is added to the peer&rsquo;s endpoint discriminator
and authenticated identity when matching up links to be
joined together in a bundle. The bundle option can also be
used to allow the establishment of multiple bundles between
the local system and the peer. Pppd uses a TDB database in
/var/run/pppd2.tdb to match up links.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Assuming that
multilink is enabled and the peer is willing to negotiate
multilink, then when pppd is invoked to bring up the first
link to the peer, it will detect that no other link is
connected to the peer and create a new bundle, that is,
another ppp network interface unit. When another pppd is
invoked to bring up another link to the peer, it will detect
the existing bundle and join its link to it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the first
link terminates (for example, because of a hangup or a
received LCP terminate-request) the bundle is not destroyed
unless there are no other links remaining in the bundle.
Rather than exiting, the first pppd keeps running after its
link terminates, until all the links in the bundle have
terminated. If the first pppd receives a SIGTERM or SIGINT
signal, it will destroy the bundle and send a SIGHUP to the
pppd processes for each of the links in the bundle. If the
first pppd receives a SIGHUP signal, it will terminate its
link but not the bundle.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note: demand
mode is not currently supported with multilink.</p>

<h2>EXAMPLES
<a name="EXAMPLES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
examples assume that the /etc/ppp/options file contains the
<i>auth</i> option (as in the default /etc/ppp/options file
in the ppp distribution).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Probably the
most common use of pppd is to dial out to an ISP. This can
be done with a command such as</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">pppd call
isp</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">where the
/etc/ppp/peers/isp file is set up by the system
administrator to contain something like this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">ttyS0 19200
crtscts <br>
connect &rsquo;/usr/sbin/chat &minus;v &minus;f
/etc/ppp/chat&minus;isp&rsquo; <br>
noauth</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In this
example, we are using chat to dial the ISP&rsquo;s modem and
go through any logon sequence required. The
/etc/ppp/chat&minus;isp file contains the script used by
chat; it could for example contain something like this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">ABORT &quot;NO
CARRIER&quot; <br>
ABORT &quot;NO DIALTONE&quot; <br>
ABORT &quot;ERROR&quot; <br>
ABORT &quot;NO ANSWER&quot; <br>
ABORT &quot;BUSY&quot; <br>
ABORT &quot;Username/Password Incorrect&quot; <br>
&quot;&quot; &quot;at&quot; <br>
OK &quot;at&amp;d0&amp;c1&quot; <br>
OK &quot;atdt2468135&quot; <br>
&quot;name:&quot; &quot;^Umyuserid&quot; <br>
&quot;word:&quot; &quot;\qmypassword&quot; <br>
&quot;ispts&quot; &quot;\q^Uppp&quot; <br>
&quot;~&minus;^Uppp&minus;~&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">See the chat(8)
man page for details of chat scripts.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Pppd can also
be used to provide a dial-in ppp service for users. If the
users already have login accounts, the simplest way to set
up the ppp service is to let the users log in to their
accounts and run pppd (installed setuid-root) with a command
such as</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">pppd
proxyarp</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To allow a user
to use the PPP facilities, you need to allocate an IP
address for that user&rsquo;s machine and create an entry in
/etc/ppp/pap&minus;secrets, /etc/ppp/chap&minus;secrets, or
/etc/ppp/srp&minus;secrets (depending on which
authentication method the PPP implementation on the
user&rsquo;s machine supports), so that the user&rsquo;s
machine can authenticate itself. For example, if Joe has a
machine called &quot;joespc&quot; that is to be allowed to
dial in to the machine called &quot;server&quot; and use the
IP address joespc.my.net, you would add an entry like this
to /etc/ppp/pap&minus;secrets or
/etc/ppp/chap&minus;secrets:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">joespc server
&quot;joe&rsquo;s secret&quot; joespc.my.net</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">(See
srp&minus;entry(8) for a means to generate the
server&rsquo;s entry when SRP&minus;SHA1 is in use.)
Alternatively, you can create a username called (for
example) &quot;ppp&quot;, whose login shell is pppd and
whose home directory is /etc/ppp. Options to be used when
pppd is run this way can be put in /etc/ppp/.ppprc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If your serial
connection is any more complicated than a piece of wire, you
may need to arrange for some control characters to be
escaped. In particular, it is often useful to escape XON
(^Q) and XOFF (^S), using <i>asyncmap a0000</i>. If the path
includes a telnet, you probably should escape ^] as well
(<i>asyncmap 200a0000</i>). If the path includes an rlogin,
you will need to use the <i>escape ff</i> option on the end
which is running the rlogin client, since many rlogin
implementations are not transparent; they will remove the
sequence [0xff, 0xff, 0x73, 0x73, followed by any 8 bytes]
from the stream.</p>

<h2>DIAGNOSTICS
<a name="DIAGNOSTICS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Messages are
sent to the syslog daemon using facility LOG_DAEMON. (This
can be overridden by recompiling pppd with the macro LOG_PPP
defined as the desired facility.) See the syslog(8)
documentation for details of where the syslog daemon will
write the messages. On most systems, the syslog daemon uses
the /etc/syslog.conf file to specify the destination(s) for
syslog messages. You may need to edit that file to suit.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>debug</i> option causes the contents of all control
packets sent or received to be logged, that is, all LCP,
PAP, CHAP, EAP, or IPCP packets. This can be useful if the
PPP negotiation does not succeed or if authentication fails.
If debugging is enabled at compile time, the <i>debug</i>
option also causes other debugging messages to be
logged.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Debugging can
also be enabled or disabled by sending a SIGUSR1 signal to
the pppd process. This signal acts as a toggle.</p>

<h2>SCRIPTS
<a name="SCRIPTS"></a>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Pppd invokes
scripts at various stages in its processing which can be
used to perform site-specific ancillary processing. These
scripts are usually shell scripts, but could be executable
code files instead. Pppd does not wait for the scripts to
finish (except for the ip-pre-up script). The scripts are
executed as root (with the real and effective user-id set to
0), so that they can do things such as update routing tables
or run privileged daemons. Be careful that the contents of
these scripts do not compromise your system&rsquo;s
security. Pppd runs the scripts with standard input, output
and error redirected to /dev/null, and with an environment
that is empty except for some environment variables that
give information about the link. The environment variables

<h2>NOTES
<a name="NOTES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Some limited
degree of control can be exercised over a running pppd
process by sending it a signal from the list below. <b><br>
SIGINT, SIGTERM</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">These signals cause pppd to
terminate the link (by closing LCP), restore the serial
device settings, and exit. If a connector or disconnector
process is currently running, pppd will send the same signal
to its process group, so as to terminate the connector or
disconnector process.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"

<td width="11%"></td>

<p><b>SIGHUP</b></p></td>
<td width="2%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>This signal causes pppd to terminate the link, restore
the serial device settings, and close the serial device. If
the <i>persist</i> or <i>demand</i> option has been
specified, pppd will try to reopen the serial device and
start another connection (after the holdoff period).
Otherwise pppd will exit. If this signal is received during
the holdoff period, it causes pppd to end the holdoff period
immediately. If a connector or disconnector process is
running, pppd will send the same signal to its process
group.</p> </td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SIGUSR1</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This signal toggles the state
of the <i>debug</i> option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SIGUSR2</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This signal causes pppd to
renegotiate compression. This can be useful to re-enable
compression after it has been disabled as a result of a
fatal decompression error. (Fatal decompression errors
generally indicate a bug in one or other
implementation.)</p>
