<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This module
provide a convenient way to create directories of arbitrary
depth and to delete an entire directory subtree from the
filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
functions are provided: <br>
make_path( $dir1, $dir2, .... ) <br>
make_path( $dir1, $dir2, ...., \%opts )</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The
<tt>&quot;make_path&quot;</tt> function creates the given
directories if they don&rsquo;t exists before, much like the
Unix command <tt>&quot;mkdir &minus;p&quot;</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The function
accepts a list of directories to be created. Its behaviour
may be tuned by an optional hashref appearing as the last
parameter on the call.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The function
returns the list of directories actually created during the
call; in scalar context the number of directories
created.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The following
keys are recognised in the option hash: <br>
mode =&gt; $num</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">The numeric permissions mode to
apply to each created directory (defaults to 0777), to be
modified by the current <tt>&quot;umask&quot;</tt>. If the
directory already exists (and thus does not need to be
created), the permissions will not be modified.</p>


<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em"><tt>&quot;mask&quot;</tt>
is recognised as an alias for this parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">verbose =&gt; $bool</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">If present, will cause
<tt>&quot;make_path&quot;</tt> to print the name of each
directory as it is created. By default nothing is
printed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">error =&gt; \$err</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">If present, it should be a
reference to a scalar. This scalar will be made to reference
an array, which will be used to store any errors that are
encountered. See the &quot; <small>ERROR
HANDLING&quot;</small> section for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">If this
parameter is not used, certain error conditions may raise a
fatal error that will cause the program will halt, unless
trapped in an <tt>&quot;eval&quot;</tt> block.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">owner =&gt; $owner <br>
user =&gt; $owner <br>
uid =&gt; $owner</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">If present, will cause any
created directory to be owned by <tt>$owner</tt>. If the
value is numeric, it will be interpreted as a uid, otherwise
as username is assumed. An error will be issued if the
username cannot be mapped to a uid, or the uid does not
exist, or the process lacks the privileges to change
ownership.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">Ownwership of
directories that already exist will not be changed.</p>


<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em"><tt>&quot;user&quot;</tt>
and <tt>&quot;uid&quot;</tt> are aliases of
<tt>&quot;owner&quot;</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">group =&gt; $group</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">If present, will cause any
created directory to be owned by the group <tt>$group</tt>.
If the value is numeric, it will be interpreted as a gid,
otherwise as group name is assumed. An error will be issued
if the group name cannot be mapped to a gid, or the gid does
not exist, or the process lacks the privileges to change
group ownership.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">Group
ownwership of directories that already exist will not be
changed.</p>

mkpath( $dir, $verbose, $mode ) <br>
mkpath( [$dir1, $dir2,...], $verbose, $mode ) <br>
mkpath( $dir1, $dir2,..., \%opt )</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The <i>mkpath()</i> function
provide the legacy interface of <i>make_path()</i> with a
different interpretation of the arguments passed. The
behaviour and return value of the function is otherwise
identical to <i>make_path()</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">remove_tree( $dir1, $dir2, ....
) <br>
remove_tree( $dir1, $dir2, ...., \%opts )</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The
<tt>&quot;remove_tree&quot;</tt> function deletes the given
directories and any files and subdirectories they might
contain, much like the Unix command <tt>&quot;rm
&minus;r&quot;</tt> or <tt>&quot;del /s&quot;</tt> on
Windows.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The function
accepts a list of directories to be removed. Its behaviour
may be tuned by an optional hashref appearing as the last
parameter on the call.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The functions
returns the number of files successfully deleted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The following
keys are recognised in the option hash: <br>
verbose =&gt; $bool</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">If present, will cause
<tt>&quot;remove_tree&quot;</tt> to print the name of each
file as it is unlinked. By default nothing is printed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">safe =&gt; $bool</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">When set to a true value, will
cause <tt>&quot;remove_tree&quot;</tt> to skip the files for
which the process lacks the required privileges needed to
delete files, such as delete privileges on
<small>VMS.</small> In other words, the code will make no
attempt to alter file permissions. Thus, if the process is
interrupted, no filesystem object will be left in a more
permissive mode.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">keep_root =&gt; $bool</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">When set to a true value, will
cause all files and subdirectories to be removed, except the
initially specified directories. This comes in handy when
cleaning out an application&rsquo;s scratch directory.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">  remove_tree( '/tmp', {keep_root =&gt; 1} );</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%;">result =&gt; \$res</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">If present, it should be a
reference to a scalar. This scalar will be made to reference
an array, which will be used to store all files and
directories unlinked during the call. If nothing is
unlinked, the array will be empty.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">  remove_tree( '/tmp', {result =&gt; \my $list} );
  print &quot;unlinked $_\n&quot; for @$list;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">This is a
useful alternative to the <tt>&quot;verbose&quot;</tt>
key.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">error =&gt; \$err</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">If present, it should be a
reference to a scalar. This scalar will be made to reference
an array, which will be used to store any errors that are
encountered. See the &quot; <small>ERROR
HANDLING&quot;</small> section for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">Removing things
is a much more dangerous proposition than creating things.
As such, there are certain conditions that
<tt>&quot;remove_tree&quot;</tt> may encounter that are so
dangerous that the only sane action left is to kill the
program.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">Use
<tt>&quot;error&quot;</tt> to trap all that is reasonable
(problems with permissions and the like), and let it die if
things get out of hand. This is the safest course of
action.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">rmtree( $dir ) <br>
rmtree( $dir, $verbose, $safe ) <br>
rmtree( [$dir1, $dir2,...], $verbose, $safe ) <br>
rmtree( $dir1, $dir2,..., \%opt )</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The <i>rmtree()</i> function
provide the legacy interface of <i>remove_tree()</i> with a
different interpretation of the arguments passed. The
behaviour and return value of the function is otherwise
identical to <i>remove_tree()</i>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b><small>ERROR
HANDLING <br>
NOTE:</small></b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The following error handling
mechanism is considered experimental and is subject to
change pending feedback from users.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If
<tt>&quot;make_path&quot;</tt> or
<tt>&quot;remove_tree&quot;</tt> encounter an error, a
diagnostic message will be printed to
<tt>&quot;STDERR&quot;</tt> via <tt>&quot;carp&quot;</tt>
(for non-fatal errors), or via <tt>&quot;croak&quot;</tt>
(for fatal errors).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If this
behaviour is not desirable, the <tt>&quot;error&quot;</tt>
attribute may be used to hold a reference to a variable,
which will be used to store the diagnostics. The variable is
made a reference to an array of hash references. Each hash
contain a single key/value pair where the key is the name of
the file, and the value is the error message (including the
contents of <tt>$!</tt> when appropriate). If a general
error is encountered the diagnostic key will be empty.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">An example
usage looks like:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  remove_tree( 'foo/bar', 'bar/rat', {error =&gt; \my $err} );
  if (@$err) {
      for my $diag (@$err) {
          my ($file, $message) = %$diag;
          if ($file eq '') {
              print &quot;general error: $message\n&quot;;
          }
          else {
              print &quot;problem unlinking $file: $message\n&quot;;
          }
      }
  }
  else {
      print &quot;No error encountered\n&quot;;
  }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that if no
errors are encountered, <tt>$err</tt> will reference an
empty array. This means that <tt>$err</tt> will always end
up <small>TRUE</small> ; so you need to test <tt>@$err</tt>
to determine if errors occured.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b><small>NOTES</small></b>
<tt><br>
&quot;File::Path&quot;</tt> blindly exports
<tt>&quot;mkpath&quot;</tt> and <tt>&quot;rmtree&quot;</tt>
into the current namespace. These days, this is considered
bad style, but to change it now would break too much code.
Nonetheless, you are invited to specify what it is you are
expecting to use:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  use File::Path 'rmtree';</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The routines
<tt>&quot;make_path&quot;</tt> and
<tt>&quot;remove_tree&quot;</tt> are <b>not</b> exported by
default. You must specify which ones you want to use.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  use File::Path 'remove_tree';</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that a
side-effect of the above is that <tt>&quot;mkpath&quot;</tt>
and <tt>&quot;rmtree&quot;</tt> are no longer exported at
all. This is due to the way the
<tt>&quot;Exporter&quot;</tt> module works. If you are
migrating a codebase to use the new interface, you will have
to list everything explicitly. But that&rsquo;s just good
practice anyway.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  use File::Path qw(remove_tree rmtree);</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i><small>API
CHANGES</small></i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<small>API</small> was changed in the 2.0 branch. For a
time, <tt>&quot;mkpath&quot;</tt> and
<tt>&quot;rmtree&quot;</tt> tried, unsuccessfully, to deal
with the two different calling mechanisms. This approach was
considered a failure.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The new
semantics are now only available with
<tt>&quot;make_path&quot;</tt> and
<tt>&quot;remove_tree&quot;</tt>. The old semantics are only
available through <tt>&quot;mkpath&quot;</tt> and
<tt>&quot;rmtree&quot;</tt>. Users are strongly encouraged
to upgrade to at least 2.08 in order to avoid surprises.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i><small>SECURITY
CONSIDERATIONS</small></i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There were race
conditions 1.x implementations of File::Path&rsquo;s
<tt>&quot;rmtree&quot;</tt> function (although sometimes
patched depending on the <small>OS</small> distribution or
platform). The 2.0 version contains code to avoid the
problem mentioned in
<small>CVE&minus;2002&minus;0435.</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">See the
following pages for more information:</p>

  http://www.debian.org/security/2005/dsa&minus;696</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Additionally,
unless the <tt>&quot;safe&quot;</tt> parameter is set (or
the third parameter in the traditional interface is
<small>TRUE</small> ), should a
<tt>&quot;remove_tree&quot;</tt> be interrupted, files that
were originally in read-only mode may now have their
permissions set to a read-write (or &quot;delete
<small>OK&quot;</small> ) mode.</p>

<h2>DIAGNOSTICS
<a name="DIAGNOSTICS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><small>FATAL</small>
errors will cause the program to halt
(<tt>&quot;croak&quot;</tt>), since the problem is so severe
that it would be dangerous to continue. (This can always be
trapped with <tt>&quot;eval&quot;</tt>, but it&rsquo;s not a
good idea. Under the circumstances, dying is the best thing
to do).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><small>SEVERE</small>
errors may be trapped using the modern interface. If the
they are not trapped, or the old interface is used, such an
error will cause the program will halt.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">All other
errors may be trapped using the modern interface, otherwise
they will be <tt>&quot;carp&quot;</tt>ed about. Program

resources (such as free inodes on Unix).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">No root path(s) specified</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><tt>&quot;make_path&quot;</tt>
was not given any paths to create. This message is only
emitted if the routine is called with the traditional
interface. The modern interface will remain silent if given
nothing to do.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">No such file or directory</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">On Windows, if

<p style="margin-left:11%;">cannot fetch initial working
directory: [errmsg]</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%;"><tt>&quot;remove_tree&quot;</tt>
attempted to determine the initial directory by calling
<tt>&quot;Cwd::getcwd&quot;</tt>, but the call failed for
some reason. No attempt will be made to delete anything.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">cannot stat initial working

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><tt>&quot;remove_tree&quot;</tt>
attempted to stat the initial directory (after having

some reason. No attempt will be made to delete anything.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">cannot chdir to [dir]:
[errmsg]</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%;"><tt>&quot;remove_tree&quot;</tt>
attempted to set the working directory in order to begin
deleting the objects therein, but was unsuccessful. This is
usually a permissions issue. The routine will continue to
delete other things, but this directory will be left
intact.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">directory [dir] changed before

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><tt>&quot;remove_tree&quot;</tt>
recorded the device and inode of a directory, and then moved
into it. It then performed a <tt>&quot;stat&quot;</tt> on
the current directory and detected that the device and inode
were no longer the same. As this is at the heart of the race
condition problem, the program will die at this point.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">cannot make directory [dir]
read+writeable: [errmsg]</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%;"><tt>&quot;remove_tree&quot;</tt>
attempted to change the permissions on the current directory
to ensure that subsequent unlinkings would not run into
problems, but was unable to do so. The permissions remain as
they were, and the program will carry on, doing the best it
can.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">cannot read [dir]: [errmsg]</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%;"><tt>&quot;remove_tree&quot;</tt>
tried to read the contents of the directory in order to
acquire the names of the directory entries to be unlinked,
but was unsuccessful. This is usually a permissions issue.
The program will continue, but the files in this directory
will remain after the call.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">cannot reset chmod [dir]:
[errmsg]</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%;"><tt>&quot;remove_tree&quot;</tt>,
after having deleted everything in a directory, attempted to

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The current working directory
of the program is <i>/some/path/to/here</i> and you are
attempting to remove an ancestor, such as <i>/some/path</i>.
The directory tree is left untouched.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The solution is
to <tt>&quot;chdir&quot;</tt> out of the child directory to
a place outside the directory tree to be removed.</p>

( <small>FATAL</small> )</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%;"><tt>&quot;remove_tree&quot;</tt>,
after having deleted everything and restored the permissions

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><tt>&quot;remove_tree&quot;</tt>
was unable to stat the parent directory after have returned
from the child. Since there is no way of knowing if we
returned to where we think we should be (by comparing device
