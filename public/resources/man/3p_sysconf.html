<h2>PROLOG

</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This manual
page is part of the POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s Manual. The
Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult
the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux
behavior), or the interface may not be implemented on
Linux.</p>

<h2>NAME
<a name="NAME"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">sysconf &minus;
get configurable system variables</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>#include
&lt;unistd.h&gt;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>long
sysconf(int</b> <i>name</i><b>);</b></p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>sysconf</i>() function provides a method for the
application to determine the current value of a configurable
system limit or option ( <i>variable</i>). The
implementation shall support all of the variables listed in
the following table and may support others.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The <i>name</i>
argument represents the system variable to be queried. The
following table lists the minimal set of system variables
from <i>&lt;limits.h&gt;</i> or <i>&lt;unistd.h&gt;</i> that
can be returned by <i>sysconf</i>(), and the symbolic
constants defined in <i>&lt;unistd.h&gt;</i> that are the
corresponding values used for <i>name</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&nbsp;
&nbsp;</p>

<h2>RETURN VALUE
<a name="RETURN VALUE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If <i>name</i>
is an invalid value, <i>sysconf</i>() shall return -1 and
set <i>errno</i> to indicate the error. If the variable
corresponding to <i>name</i> has no limit, <i>sysconf</i>()
shall return -1 without changing the value of <i>errno</i>.
Note that indefinite limits do not imply infinite limits;
see <i>&lt;limits.h&gt;</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Otherwise,
<i>sysconf</i>() shall return the current variable value on
the system. The value returned shall not be more restrictive
than the corresponding value described to the application
when it was compiled with the implementation&rsquo;s
<i>&lt;limits.h&gt;</i> or <i>&lt;unistd.h&gt;</i>. The
value shall not change during the lifetime of the calling
process, &nbsp;except that <i>sysconf</i>(_SC_OPEN_MAX) may
return different values before and after a call to
<i>setrlimit</i>() which changes the RLIMIT_NOFILE soft
limit.</p>

<h2>ERRORS
<a name="ERRORS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>sysconf</i>() function shall fail if:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>The
following sections are informative.</i></p>

<h2>EXAMPLES
<a name="EXAMPLES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">None.</p>

<h2>APPLICATION USAGE
<a name="APPLICATION USAGE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As -1 is a
permissible return value in a successful situation, an
application wishing to check for error situations should set
<i>errno</i> to 0, then call <i>sysconf</i>(), and, if it
returns -1, check to see if <i>errno</i> is non-zero.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the value of
<i>sysconf</i>(_SC_2_VERSION) is not equal to the value of
the _POSIX2_VERSION symbolic constant, the utilities
available via <i>system</i>() or <i>popen</i>() might not
behave as described in the Shell and Utilities volume of
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001. This would mean that the
application is not running in an environment that conforms
to the Shell and Utilities volume of
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001. Some applications might be
able to deal with this, others might not. However, the
functions defined in this volume of
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 continue to operate as
specified, even if <i>sysconf</i>(_SC_2_VERSION) reports
that the utilities no longer perform as specified.</p>

<h2>RATIONALE
<a name="RATIONALE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This
functionality was added in response to requirements of
application developers and of system vendors who deal with
many international system configurations. It is closely
related to <i>pathconf</i>() and <i>fpathconf</i>().</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Although a
conforming application can run on all systems by never
demanding more resources than the minimum values published
in this volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001, it is
useful for that application to be able to use the actual
value for the quantity of a resource available on any given
system. To do this, the application makes use of the value
of a symbolic constant in <i>&lt;limits.h&gt;</i> or
<i>&lt;unistd.h&gt;</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">However, once
compiled, the application must still be able to cope if the
amount of resource available is increased. To that end, an
application may need a means of determining the quantity of
a resource, or the presence of an option, at execution
time.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Two examples
are offered:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="12%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">1.</p></td>
<td width="2%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">Applications may wish to act
differently on systems with or without job control.
Applications vendors who wish to distribute only a single
binary package to all instances of a computer architecture
would be forced to assume job control is never available if
it were to rely solely on the <i>&lt;unistd.h&gt;</i> value
published in this volume of
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001.</p> </td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="12%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p>2.</p></td>
<td width="2%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>International applications vendors occasionally require
knowledge of the number of clock ticks per second. Without
these facilities, they would be required to either
distribute their applications partially in source form or to
have 50 Hz and 60 Hz versions for the various countries in
which they operate.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is the
knowledge that many applications are actually distributed
widely in executable form that leads to this facility. If
limited to the most restrictive values in the headers, such
applications would have to be prepared to accept the most
limited environments offered by the smallest microcomputers.
Although this is entirely portable, there was a consensus
that they should be able to take advantage of the facilities
offered by large systems, without the restrictions
associated with source and object distributions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">During the
discussions of this feature, it was pointed out that it is
almost always possible for an application to discern what a
value might be at runtime by suitably testing the various
functions themselves. And, in any event, it could always be
written to adequately deal with error returns from the
various functions. In the end, it was felt that this imposed
an unreasonable level of complication and sophistication on
the application writer.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This runtime
facility is not meant to provide ever-changing values that
applications have to check multiple times. The values are
seen as changing no more frequently than once per system
initialization, such as by a system administrator or
operator with an automatic configuration program. This
volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 specifies that they
shall not change within the lifetime of the process.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Some values
apply to the system overall and others vary at the file
system or directory level. The latter are described in
<i>pathconf</i>() .</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that all
values returned must be expressible as integers. String
values were considered, but the additional flexibility of
this approach was rejected due to its added complexity of
implementation and use.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Some values,
such as {PATH_MAX}, are sometimes so large that they must
not be used to, say, allocate arrays. The <i>sysconf</i>()
function returns a negative value to show that this symbolic
constant is not even defined in this case.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Similar to
<i>pathconf</i>(), this permits the implementation not to
have a limit. When one resource is infinite, returning an
error indicating that some other resource limit has been
reached is conforming behavior.</p>
