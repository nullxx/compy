Geometry manager that arranges widgets in a grid</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>grid</b>
<i>option arg</i> ?<i>arg ...</i>?
_________________________________________________________________</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The <b>grid</b>
command is used to communicate with the grid geometry
manager that arranges widgets in rows and columns inside of
another window, called the geometry master (or master
window). The <b>grid</b> command can have any of several
forms, depending on the <i>option</i> argument: <b><br>
grid</b> <i>slave</i> ?<i>slave ...</i>?
?<i>options</i>?</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If the first argument to
<b>grid</b> is suitable as the first slave argument to
<b>grid configure</b>, either a window name (any value
starting with <b>.</b>) or one of the characters <b>x</b> or
<b>^</b> (see the <b>RELATIVE PLACEMENT</b> section below),
then the command is processed in the same way as <b>grid
configure</b>. <big>&#9474;</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>grid anchor</b>
<i>master</i> ?<i>anchor</i>? <big>&#9474;</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The anchor value controls how
to place the grid within the <big>&#9474;</big> master when
no row/column has any weight. See <b>THE GRID</b>
<big>&#9474;</big> <b>ALGORITHM</b> below for further
details. The default <i>anchor</i> is <i>nw</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>grid bbox</b> <i>master</i>
?<i>column row</i>? ?<i>column2 row2</i>?</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">With no arguments, the bounding
box (in pixels) of the grid is returned. The return value
consists of 4 integers. The first two are the pixel offset
from the master window (x then y) of the top-left corner of
the grid, and the second two integers are the width and
height of the grid, also in pixels. If a single
<i>column</i> and <i>row</i> is specified on the command
line, then the bounding box for that cell is returned, where
the top left cell is numbered from zero. If both
<i>column</i> and <i>row</i> arguments are specified, then
the bounding box spanning the rows and columns indicated is
returned.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>grid columnconfigure</b>
<i>master index</i> ?<i>&minus;option value...</i>?</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Query or set the column
properties of the <i>index</i> column of the geometry
master, <i>master</i>. The valid options are
<b>&minus;minsize</b>, <b>&minus;weight</b>,
<b>&minus;uniform</b> and <b>&minus;pad</b>. If one or more
options are provided, then <i>index</i> may be given as a
list of column indices to which the configuration options
will operate on. Indices may be <big>&#9474;</big> integers,
window names or the keyword <i>all</i>. For <i>all</i> the
options <big>&#9474;</big> apply to all columns currently
occupied be slave windows. For a <big>&#9474;</big> window
name, that window must be a slave of this master and the
<big>&#9474;</big> options apply to all columns currently
occupied be the slave. The <b>&minus;minsize</b> option sets
the minimum size, in screen units, that will be permitted
for this column. The <b>&minus;weight</b> option (an integer
value) sets the relative weight for apportioning any extra
spaces among columns. A weight of zero (0) indicates the
column will not deviate from its requested size. A column
whose weight is two will grow at twice the rate as a column
of weight one when extra space is allocated to the layout.
The <b>&minus;uniform</b> option, when a non-empty value is
supplied, places the column in a <i>uniform group</i> with
other columns that have the same value for
<b>&minus;uniform</b>. The space for columns belonging to a
uniform group is allocated so that their sizes are always in
strict proportion to their <b>&minus;weight</b> values. See
<b>THE GRID ALGORITHM</b> below for further details. The
<b>&minus;pad</b> option specifies the number of screen
units that will be added to the largest window contained
completely in that column when the grid geometry manager
requests a size from the containing window. If only an
option is specified, with no value, the current value of
that option is returned. If only the master window and index
is specified, all the current settings are returned in a
list of &ldquo;&minus;option value&rdquo; pairs.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>grid configure</b>
<i>slave</i> ?<i>slave ...</i>? ?<i>options</i>?</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The arguments consist of the
names of one or more slave windows followed by pairs of
arguments that specify how to manage the slaves. The
characters <b>&minus;</b>, <b>x</b> and <b>^</b>, can be
specified instead of a window name to alter the default
location of a <i>slave</i>, as described in the <b>RELATIVE
PLACEMENT</b> section, below. The following options are
supported: <b><br>
&minus;column</b> <i>n</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Insert the slave so that it
occupies the <i>n</i>th column in the grid. Column numbers
start with 0. If this option is not supplied, then the slave
is arranged just to the right of previous slave specified on
this call to <b>grid</b>, or column &ldquo;0&rdquo; if it is
the first slave. For each <b>x</b> that immediately precedes
the <i>slave</i>, the column position is incremented by one.
Thus the <b>x</b> represents a blank column for this row in
the grid.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>&minus;columnspan</b>
<i>n</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Insert the slave so that it
occupies <i>n</i> columns in the grid. The default is one
column, unless the window name is followed by a
<b>&minus;</b>, in which case the columnspan is incremented
once for each immediately following <b>&minus;</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>&minus;in</b>
<i>other</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Insert the slave(s) in the
master window given by <i>other</i>. The default is the
first slave&rsquo;s parent window.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>&minus;ipadx</b>
<i>amount</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">The <i>amount</i> specifies how
much horizontal internal padding to leave on each side of
the slave(s). This is space is added inside the slave(s)
border. The <i>amount</i> must be a valid screen distance,
such as <b>2</b> or <b>.5c</b>. It defaults to 0.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>&minus;ipady</b>
<i>amount</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">The <i>amount</i> specifies how
much vertical internal padding to leave on the top and
bottom of the slave(s). This space is added inside the
slave(s) border. The <i>amount</i> defaults to 0.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>&minus;padx</b>
<i>amount</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">The <i>amount</i> specifies how
much horizontal external padding to leave on each side of
the slave(s), in screen units. <i>Amount</i> may be a list
of two values to specify padding for left and right
separately. The <i>amount</i> defaults to 0. This space is
added outside the slave(s) border.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>&minus;pady</b>
<i>amount</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">The <i>amount</i> specifies how
much vertical external padding to leave on the top and
bottom of the slave(s), in screen units. <i>Amount</i> may
be a list of two values to specify padding for top and
bottom separately. The <i>amount</i> defaults to 0. This
space is added outside the slave(s) border.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="22%"></td>
<td width="9%">


<p><b>&minus;row</b> <i>n</i></p></td>
<td width="1%"></td>
<td width="68%">


<p>Insert the slave so that it occupies the <i>n</i>th row
in the grid. Row numbers start with 0. If this option is not
supplied, then the slave is arranged on the same row as the
previous slave specified on this call to <b>grid</b>, or the
first unoccupied row if this is the first slave.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>&minus;rowspan</b>
<i>n</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Insert the slave so that it
occupies <i>n</i> rows in the grid. The default is one row.
If the next <b>grid</b> command contains <b>^</b> characters
instead of <i>slaves</i> that line up with the columns of
this <i>slave</i>, then the <b>rowspan</b> of this
<i>slave</i> is extended by one.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>&minus;sticky</b>
<i>style</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">If a slave&rsquo;s cell is
larger than its requested dimensions, this option may be
used to position (or stretch) the slave within its cell.
<i>Style</i> is a string that contains zero or more of the
characters <b>n</b>, <b>s</b>, <b>e</b> or <b>w</b>. The
string can optionally contains spaces or commas, but they
are ignored. Each letter refers to a side (north, south,
east, or west) that the slave will &ldquo;stick&rdquo; to.
If both <b>n</b> and <b>s</b> (or <b>e</b> and <b>w</b>) are
specified, the slave will be stretched to fill the entire
height (or width) of its cavity. The <b>sticky</b> option
subsumes the combination of <b>&minus;anchor</b> and
<b>&minus;fill</b> that is used by <b>pack</b>. The default
is &ldquo;&rdquo;, which causes the slave to be centered in
its cavity, at its requested size.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If any of the
slaves are already managed by the geometry manager then any
unspecified options for them retain their previous values
rather than receiving default values.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>grid forget</b> <i>slave</i>
?<i>slave ...</i>?</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Removes each of the
<i>slave</i>s from grid for its master and unmaps their
windows. The slaves will no longer be managed by the grid
geometry manager. The configuration options for that window
are forgotten, so that if the slave is managed once more by
the grid geometry manager, the initial default settings are
used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>grid info</b>
<i>slave</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Returns a list whose elements
are the current configuration state of the slave given by
<i>slave</i> in the same option-value form that might be
specified to <b>grid configure</b>. The first two elements
of the list are &ldquo;<b>&minus;in</b> <i>master</i>&rdquo;
where <i>master</i> is the slave&rsquo;s master.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>grid location</b> <i>master
x y</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Given <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>
values in screen units relative to the master window, the
column and row number at that <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> location
is returned. For locations that are above or to the left of
the grid, <b>&minus;1</b> is returned.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>grid propagate</b>
<i>master</i> ?<i>boolean</i>?</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If <i>boolean</i> has a true
boolean value such as <b>1</b> or <b>on</b> then propagation
is enabled for <i>master</i>, which must be a window name
(see <b>GEOMETRY PROPAGATION</b> below). If <i>boolean</i>
has a false boolean value then propagation is disabled for
<i>master</i>. In either of these cases an empty string is
returned. If <i>boolean</i> is omitted then the command
returns <b>0</b> or <b>1</b> to indicate whether propagation
is currently enabled for <i>master</i>. Propagation is
enabled by default.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>grid rowconfigure</b>
<i>master index</i> ?<i>&minus;option value...</i>?</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Query or set the row properties
of the <i>index</i> row of the geometry master,
<i>master</i>. The valid options are <b>&minus;minsize</b>,
<b>&minus;weight</b>, <b>&minus;uniform</b> and
<b>&minus;pad</b>. If one or more options are provided, then
<i>index</i> may be given as a list of row indices to which
the configuration options will operate on. Indices may be
integers, <big>&#9474;</big> window names or the keyword
<i>all</i>. For <i>all</i> the options apply to
<big>&#9474;</big> all rows currently occupied be slave
windows. For a window name, <big>&#9474;</big> that window
must be a slave of this master and the options apply
<big>&#9474;</big> to all rows currently occupied be the
slave. The <b>&minus;minsize</b> option sets the minimum
size, in screen units, that will be permitted for this row.
The <b>&minus;weight</b> option (an integer value) sets the
relative weight for apportioning any extra spaces among
rows. A weight of zero (0) indicates the row will not
deviate from its requested size. A row whose weight is two
will grow at twice the rate as a row of weight one when
extra space is allocated to the layout. The
<b>&minus;uniform</b> option, when a non-empty value is
supplied, places the row in a <i>uniform group</i> with
other rows that have the same value for
<b>&minus;uniform</b>. The space for rows belonging to a
uniform group is allocated so that their sizes are always in
strict proportion to their <b>&minus;weight</b> values. See
<b>THE GRID ALGORITHM</b> below for further details. The
<b>&minus;pad</b> option specifies the number of screen
units that will be added to the largest window contained
completely in that row when the grid geometry manager
requests a size from the containing window. If only an
option is specified, with no value, the current value of
that option is returned. If only the master window and index
is specified, all the current settings are returned in a
list of &ldquo;-option value&rdquo; pairs.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>grid remove</b> <i>slave</i>
?<i>slave ...</i>?</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Removes each of the
<i>slave</i>s from grid for its master and unmaps their
windows. The slaves will no longer be managed by the grid
geometry manager. However, the configuration options for
that window are remembered, so that if the slave is managed
once more by the grid geometry manager, the previous values
are retained.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>grid size</b>
<i>master</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Returns the size of the grid
(in columns then rows) for <i>master</i>. The size is
determined either by the <i>slave</i> occupying the largest
row or column, or the largest column or row with a
<b>minsize</b>, <b>weight</b>, or <b>pad</b> that is
non-zero.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>grid slaves</b>
<i>master</i> ?<i>&minus;option value</i>?</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If no options are supplied, a
list of all of the slaves in <i>master</i> are returned,
most recently manages first. <i>Option</i> can be either
<b>&minus;row</b> or <b>&minus;column</b> which causes only
the slaves in the row (or column) specified by <i>value</i>
to be returned.</p>

<h2>RELATIVE PLACEMENT
<a name="RELATIVE PLACEMENT"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The <b>grid</b>
command contains a limited set of capabilities that permit
layouts to be created without specifying the row and column
information for each slave. This permits slaves to be
rearranged, added, or removed without the need to explicitly
specify row and column information. When no column or row
information is specified for a <i>slave</i>, default values
are chosen for <b>column</b>, <b>row</b>, <b>columnspan</b>
and <b>rowspan</b> at the time the <i>slave</i> is managed.
The values are chosen based upon the current layout of the
grid, the position of the <i>slave</i> relative to other
<i>slave</i>s in the same grid command, and the presence of
the characters <b>&minus;</b>, <b>x</b>, and <b>^</b> in
<b>grid</b> command where <i>slave</i> names are normally
expected.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="22%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p><b>&minus;</b></p></td>
<td width="9%"></td>
<td width="68%">


<p>This increases the columnspan of the <i>slave</i> to the
left. Several <b>&minus;</b>&rsquo;s in a row will
successively increase the columnspan. A <b>&minus;</b> may
not follow a <b>^</b> or a <b>x</b>, nor may it be the first
<i>slave</i> argument to <b>grid configure</b>.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="22%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p><b>x</b></p></td>
<td width="9%"></td>
<td width="68%">


<p>This leaves an empty column between the <i>slave</i> on
the left and the <i>slave</i> on the right.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="22%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p><b>^</b></p></td>
<td width="9%"></td>
<td width="68%">


<p>This extends the <b>rowspan</b> of the <i>slave</i>
above the <b>^</b>&rsquo;s in the grid. The number of
<b>^</b>&rsquo;s in a row must match the number of columns
spanned by the <i>slave</i> above it.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<h2>THE GRID ALGORITHM
<a name="THE GRID ALGORITHM"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The grid
geometry manager lays out its slaves in three steps. In the
first step, the minimum size needed to fit all of the slaves
is computed, then (if propagation is turned on), a request
is made of the master window to become that size. In the
second step, the requested size is compared against the
actual size of the master. If the sizes are different, then
spaces is added to or taken away from the layout as needed.
For the final step, each slave is positioned in its row(s)
and column(s) based on the setting of its <i>sticky</i>
flag.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To compute the
minimum size of a layout, the grid geometry manager first
looks at all slaves whose columnspan and rowspan values are
one, and computes the nominal size of each row or column to
be either the <i>minsize</i> for that row or column, or the
sum of the <i>pad</i>ding plus the size of the largest
slave, whichever is greater. After that the rows or columns
in each uniform group adapt to each other. Then the slaves
whose rowspans or columnspans are greater than one are
examined. If a group of rows or columns need to be increased
in size in order to accommodate these slaves, then extra
space is added to each row or column in the group according
to its <i>weight</i>. For each group whose weights are all
zero, the additional space is apportioned equally.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When multiple
rows or columns belong to a uniform group, the space
allocated to them is always in proportion to their weights.
(A weight of zero is considered to be 1.) In other words, a
row or column configured with <b>&minus;weight 1
&minus;uniform a</b> will have exactly the same size as any
other row or column configured with <b>&minus;weight 1
&minus;uniform a</b>. A row or column configured with
<b>&minus;weight 2 &minus;uniform b</b> will be exactly
twice as large as one that is configured with
<b>&minus;weight 1 &minus;uniform b</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">More
technically, each row or column in the group will have a
size equal to <i>k*weight</i> for some constant <i>k</i>.
The constant <i>k</i> is chosen so that no row or column
becomes smaller than its minimum size. For example, if all
rows or columns in a group have the same weight, then each
row or column will have the same size as the largest row or
column in the group.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For masters
whose size is larger than the requested layout, the
<big>&#9474;</big> additional space is apportioned according
to the row and column <big>&#9474;</big> weights. If all of
the weights are zero, the layout is placed within
<big>&#9474;</big> its master according to the <i>anchor</i>
value. For masters whose size is <big>&#9474;</big> smaller
than the requested layout, space is taken away from columns
and <big>&#9474;</big> rows according to their weights.
However, once a column or row shrinks <big>&#9474;</big> to
its minsize, its weight is taken to be zero. If more space
needs to <big>&#9474;</big> be removed from a layout than
would be permitted, as when all the rows <big>&#9474;</big>
or columns are at their minimum sizes, the layout is placed
and clipped <big>&#9474;</big> according to the
<i>anchor</i> value.</p>

<h2>GEOMETRY PROPAGATION
<a name="GEOMETRY PROPAGATION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The grid
geometry manager normally computes how large a master must
be to just exactly meet the needs of its slaves, and it sets
the requested width and height of the master to these
dimensions. This causes geometry information to propagate up
through a window hierarchy to a top-level window so that the
entire sub-tree sizes itself to fit the needs of the leaf
windows. However, the <b>grid propagate</b> command may be
used to turn off propagation for one or more masters. If
propagation is disabled then grid will not set the requested
width and height of the master window. This may be useful
if, for example, you wish for a master window to have a
fixed size that you specify.</p>

<h2>RESTRICTIONS ON MASTER WINDOWS
<a name="RESTRICTIONS ON MASTER WINDOWS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The master for
each slave must either be the slave&rsquo;s parent (the
default) or a descendant of the slave&rsquo;s parent. This
restriction is necessary to guarantee that the slave can be
placed over any part of its master that is visible without
danger of the slave being clipped by its parent. In
addition, all slaves in one call to <b>grid</b> must have
the same master.</p>

<h2>STACKING ORDER
<a name="STACKING ORDER"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the master
for a slave is not its parent then you must make sure that
the slave is higher in the stacking order than the master.
Otherwise the master will obscure the slave and it will
appear as if the slave has not been managed correctly. The
easiest way to make sure the slave is higher than the master
is to create the master window first: the most recently
created window will be highest in the stacking order.</p>

<h2>CREDITS
<a name="CREDITS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The <b>grid</b>
command is based on ideas taken from the <i>GridBag</i>
geometry manager written by Doug. Stein, and the
<b>blt_table</b> geometry manager, written by George
Howlett.</p>
