<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">perlfilter
&minus; Source Filters</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This article is
about a little-known feature of Perl called <i>source
filters</i>. Source filters alter the program text of a
module before Perl sees it, much as a C preprocessor alters
the source text of a C program before the compiler sees it.
This article tells you more about what source filters are,
how they work, and how to write your own.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The original
purpose of source filters was to let you encrypt your
program source to prevent casual piracy. This isn&rsquo;t
all they can do, as you&rsquo;ll soon learn. But first, the
basics.</p>

<h2>CONCEPTS
<a name="CONCEPTS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Before the Perl
interpreter can execute a Perl script, it must first read it
from a file into memory for parsing and compilation. If that
script itself includes other scripts with a
<tt>&quot;use&quot;</tt> or <tt>&quot;require&quot;</tt>
statement, then each of those scripts will have to be read
from their respective files as well.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Now think of
each logical connection between the Perl parser and an
individual file as a <i>source stream</i>. A source stream
is created when the Perl parser opens a file, it continues
to exist as the source code is read into memory, and it is
destroyed when Perl is finished parsing the file. If the
parser encounters a <tt>&quot;require&quot;</tt> or
<tt>&quot;use&quot;</tt> statement in a source stream, a new
and distinct stream is created just for that file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The diagram
below represents a single source stream, with the flow of
source from a Perl script file on the left into the Perl
parser on the right. This is how Perl normally operates.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    file &minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&gt; parser</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There are two
important points to remember:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p>1.</p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="82%">


<p>Although there can be any number of source streams in
existence at any given time, only one will be active.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p>2.</p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="82%">


<p>Every source stream is associated with only one
file.</p> </td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A source filter
is a special kind of Perl module that intercepts and
modifies a source stream before it reaches the parser. A
source filter changes our diagram like this:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    file &minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&gt; filter &minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&gt; parser</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If that
doesn&rsquo;t make much sense, consider the analogy of a
command pipeline. Say you have a shell script stored in the
compressed file <i>trial.gz</i>. The simple pipeline command
below runs the script without needing to create a temporary
file to hold the uncompressed file.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    gunzip &minus;c trial.gz | sh</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In this case,
the data flow from the pipeline can be represented as
follows:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    trial.gz &minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&gt; gunzip &minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&gt; sh</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">With source
filters, you can store the text of your script compressed
and use a source filter to uncompress it for Perl&rsquo;s
parser:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">     compressed           gunzip
    Perl program &minus;&minus;&minus;&gt; source filter &minus;&minus;&minus;&gt; parser</pre>


<h2>USING FILTERS
<a name="USING FILTERS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">So how do you
use a source filter in a Perl script? Above, I said that a
source filter is just a special kind of module. Like all
Perl modules, a source filter is invoked with a use
statement.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Say you want to
pass your Perl source through the C preprocessor before
execution. As it happens, the source filters distribution
comes with a C preprocessor filter module called
Filter::cpp.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Below is an
example program, <tt>&quot;cpp_test&quot;</tt>, which makes
use of this filter. Line numbers have been added to allow
specific lines to be referenced easily.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    1: use Filter::cpp;
    2: #define TRUE 1
    3: $a = TRUE;
    4: print &quot;a = $a\n&quot;;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When you
execute this script, Perl creates a source stream for the
file. Before the parser processes any of the lines from the
file, the source stream looks like this:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    cpp_test &minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&gt; parser</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Line 1,
<tt>&quot;use Filter::cpp&quot;</tt>, includes and installs
the <tt>&quot;cpp&quot;</tt> filter module. All source
filters work this way. The use statement is compiled and
executed at compile time, before any more of the file is
read, and it attaches the cpp filter to the source stream
behind the scenes. Now the data flow looks like this:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    cpp_test &minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&gt; cpp filter &minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&gt; parser</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As the parser
reads the second and subsequent lines from the source
stream, it feeds those lines through the
<tt>&quot;cpp&quot;</tt> source filter before processing
them. The <tt>&quot;cpp&quot;</tt> filter simply passes each
line through the real C preprocessor. The output from the C
preprocessor is then inserted back into the source stream by
the filter.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">                  .&minus;&gt; cpp &minus;&minus;.
                  |         |
                  |         |
                  |       &lt;&minus;'
   cpp_test &minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&gt; cpp filter &minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&gt; parser</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The parser then
sees the following code:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    use Filter::cpp;
    $a = 1;
    print &quot;a = $a\n&quot;;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Let&rsquo;s
consider what happens when the filtered code includes
another module with use:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    1: use Filter::cpp;
    2: #define TRUE 1
    3: use Fred;
    4: $a = TRUE;
    5: print &quot;a = $a\n&quot;;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<tt>&quot;cpp&quot;</tt> filter does not apply to the text
of the Fred module, only to the text of the file that used
it (<tt>&quot;cpp_test&quot;</tt>). Although the use
statement on line 3 will pass through the cpp filter, the
module that gets included (<tt>&quot;Fred&quot;</tt>) will
not. The source streams look like this after line 3 has been
parsed and before line 4 is parsed:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    cpp_test &minus;&minus;&minus;&gt; cpp filter &minus;&minus;&minus;&gt; parser (INACTIVE)
    Fred.pm &minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&gt; parser</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As you can see,
a new stream has been created for reading the source from
<tt>&quot;Fred.pm&quot;</tt>. This stream will remain active
until all of <tt>&quot;Fred.pm&quot;</tt> has been parsed.
The source stream for <tt>&quot;cpp_test&quot;</tt> will
still exist, but is inactive. Once the parser has finished
reading Fred.pm, the source stream associated with it will
be destroyed. The source stream for
<tt>&quot;cpp_test&quot;</tt> then becomes active again and
the parser reads line 4 and subsequent lines from
<tt>&quot;cpp_test&quot;</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can use
more than one source filter on a single file. Similarly, you
can reuse the same filter in as many files as you like.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For example, if
you have a uuencoded and compressed source file, it is
possible to stack a uudecode filter and an uncompression
filter like this:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    use Filter::uudecode; use Filter::uncompress;
    M'XL(&quot;.H&lt;US4''V9I;F%L')Q;&gt;7/;1I;_&gt;_I3=&amp;E=%:F*I&quot;T?22Q/
    M6]9*&lt;IQCO*XFT&quot;0[PL%%'Y+IG?WN^ZYN&minus;$'J.[.JE$,20/?K=_[&gt;
    ...</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Once the first
line has been processed, the flow will look like this:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    file &minus;&minus;&minus;&gt; uudecode &minus;&minus;&minus;&gt; uncompress &minus;&minus;&minus;&gt; parser
               filter         filter</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Data flows
through filters in the same order they appear in the source
file. The uudecode filter appeared before the uncompress
filter, so the source file will be uudecoded before
it&rsquo;s uncompressed.</p>

<h2>WRITING A SOURCE FILTER
<a name="WRITING A SOURCE FILTER"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There are three
ways to write your own source filter. You can write it in C,
use an external program as a filter, or write the filter in
Perl. I won&rsquo;t cover the first two in any great detail,
so I&rsquo;ll get them out of the way first. Writing the
filter in Perl is most convenient, so I&rsquo;ll devote the
most space to it.</p>

<h2>WRITING A SOURCE FILTER IN C
<a name="WRITING A SOURCE FILTER IN C"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The first of
the three available techniques is to write the filter
completely in C. The external module you create interfaces
directly with the source filter hooks provided by Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The advantage
of this technique is that you have complete control over the
implementation of your filter. The big disadvantage is the
increased complexity required to write the filter &minus;
not only do you need to understand the source filter hooks,
but you also need a reasonable knowledge of Perl guts. One
of the few times it is worth going to this trouble is when
writing a source scrambler. The <tt>&quot;decrypt&quot;</tt>
filter (which unscrambles the source before Perl parses it)
included with the source filter distribution is an example
of a C source filter (see Decryption Filters, below).
<b><br>
Decryption Filters</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">All decryption filters work on
the principle of &quot;security through obscurity.&quot;
Regardless of how well you write a decryption filter and how
strong your encryption algorithm is, anyone determined
enough can retrieve the original source code. The reason is
quite simple &minus; once the decryption filter has
decrypted the source back to its original form, fragments of
it will be stored in the computer&rsquo;s memory as Perl
parses it. The source might only be in memory for a short
period of time, but anyone possessing a debugger, skill, and
lots of patience can eventually reconstruct your
program.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">That said,
there are a number of steps that can be taken to make life
difficult for the potential cracker. The most important:
Write your decryption filter in C and statically link the
decryption module into the Perl binary. For further tips to
make life difficult for the potential cracker, see the file
<i>decrypt.pm</i> in the source filters distribution.</p>

<h2>CREATING A SOURCE FILTER AS A SEPARATE EXECUTABLE
<a name="CREATING A SOURCE FILTER AS A SEPARATE EXECUTABLE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">An alternative
to writing the filter in C is to create a separate
executable in the language of your choice. The separate
executable reads from standard input, does whatever
processing is necessary, and writes the filtered data to
standard output. <tt>&quot;Filter::cpp&quot;</tt> is an
example of a source filter implemented as a separate
executable &minus; the executable is the C preprocessor
bundled with your C compiler.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The source
filter distribution includes two modules that simplify this
task: <tt>&quot;Filter::exec&quot;</tt> and
<tt>&quot;Filter::sh&quot;</tt>. Both allow you to run any
external executable. Both use a coprocess to control the
flow of data into and out of the external executable. (For
details on coprocesses, see Stephens, W.R., &quot;Advanced
Programming in the <small>UNIX</small> Environment.&quot;
Addison-Wesley, <small>ISBN
0&minus;210&minus;56317&minus;7,</small> pages
441&minus;445.) The difference between them is that
<tt>&quot;Filter::exec&quot;</tt> spawns the external
command directly, while <tt>&quot;Filter::sh&quot;</tt>
spawns a shell to execute the external command. (Unix uses
the Bourne shell; <small>NT</small> uses the cmd shell.)
Spawning a shell allows you to make use of the shell
metacharacters and redirection facilities.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Here is an
example script that uses
<tt>&quot;Filter::sh&quot;</tt>:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    use Filter::sh 'tr XYZ PQR';
    $a = 1;
    print &quot;XYZ a = $a\n&quot;;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The output
you&rsquo;ll get when the script is executed:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    PQR a = 1</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Writing a
source filter as a separate executable works fine, but a
small performance penalty is incurred. For example, if you
execute the small example above, a separate subprocess will
be created to run the Unix <tt>&quot;tr&quot;</tt> command.
Each use of the filter requires its own subprocess. If
creating subprocesses is expensive on your system, you might
want to consider one of the other options for creating
source filters.</p>

<h2>WRITING A SOURCE FILTER IN PERL
<a name="WRITING A SOURCE FILTER IN PERL"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The easiest and
most portable option available for creating your own source
filter is to write it completely in Perl. To distinguish
this from the previous two techniques, I&rsquo;ll call it a
Perl source filter.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To help
understand how to write a Perl source filter we need an
example to study. Here is a complete source filter that
performs rot13 decoding. (Rot13 is a very simple encryption
scheme used in Usenet postings to hide the contents of
offensive posts. It moves every letter forward thirteen
places, so that A becomes N, B becomes O, and Z becomes
M.)</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">   package Rot13;
   use Filter::Util::Call;
   sub import {
      my ($type) = @_;
      my ($ref) = [];
      filter_add(bless $ref);
   }
   sub filter {
      my ($self) = @_;
      my ($status);
      tr/n&minus;za&minus;mN&minus;ZA&minus;M/a&minus;zA&minus;Z/
         if ($status = filter_read()) &gt; 0;
      $status;
   }
   1;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">All Perl source
filters are implemented as Perl classes and have the same
basic structure as the example above.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">First, we
include the <tt>&quot;Filter::Util::Call&quot;</tt> module,
which exports a number of functions into your filter&rsquo;s
namespace. The filter shown above uses two of these
functions, <tt>&quot;filter_add()&quot;</tt> and
<tt>&quot;filter_read()&quot;</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Next, we create
the filter object and associate it with the source stream by
defining the <tt>&quot;import&quot;</tt> function. If you
know Perl well enough, you know that
<tt>&quot;import&quot;</tt> is called automatically every
time a module is included with a use statement. This makes
<tt>&quot;import&quot;</tt> the ideal place to both create
and install a filter object.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In the example
filter, the object (<tt>$ref</tt>) is blessed just like any
other Perl object. Our example uses an anonymous array, but
this isn&rsquo;t a requirement. Because this example
doesn&rsquo;t need to store any context information, we
could have used a scalar or hash reference just as well. The
next section demonstrates context data.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The association
between the filter object and the source stream is made with
the <tt>&quot;filter_add()&quot;</tt> function. This takes a
filter object as a parameter (<tt>$ref</tt> in this case)
and installs it in the source stream.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Finally, there
is the code that actually does the filtering. For this type
of Perl source filter, all the filtering is done in a method
called <tt>&quot;filter()&quot;</tt>. (It is also possible
to write a Perl source filter using a closure. See the
<tt>&quot;Filter::Util::Call&quot;</tt> manual page for more
details.) It&rsquo;s called every time the Perl parser needs
another line of source to process. The
<tt>&quot;filter()&quot;</tt> method, in turn, reads lines
from the source stream using the
<tt>&quot;filter_read()&quot;</tt> function.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If a line was
available from the source stream,
<tt>&quot;filter_read()&quot;</tt> returns a status value
greater than zero and appends the line to <tt>$_</tt>. A
status value of zero indicates end-of-file, less than zero
means an error. The filter function itself is expected to
return its status in the same way, and put the filtered line
it wants written to the source stream in <tt>$_</tt>. The
use of <tt>$_</tt> accounts for the brevity of most Perl
source filters.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In order to
make use of the rot13 filter we need some way of encoding
the source file in rot13 format. The script below,
<tt>&quot;mkrot13&quot;</tt>, does just that.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    die &quot;usage mkrot13 filename\n&quot; unless @ARGV;
    my $in = $ARGV[0];
    my $out = &quot;$in.tmp&quot;;
    open(IN, &quot;&lt;$in&quot;) or die &quot;Cannot open file $in: $!\n&quot;;
    open(OUT, &quot;&gt;$out&quot;) or die &quot;Cannot open file $out: $!\n&quot;;
    print OUT &quot;use Rot13;\n&quot;;
    while (&lt;IN&gt;) {
       tr/a&minus;zA&minus;Z/n&minus;za&minus;mN&minus;ZA&minus;M/;
       print OUT;
    }
    close IN;
    close OUT;
    unlink $in;
    rename $out, $in;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If we encrypt
this with <tt>&quot;mkrot13&quot;</tt>:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    print &quot; hello fred \n&quot;;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">the result will
be this:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    use Rot13;
    cevag &quot;uryyb serq\a&quot;;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Running it
produces this output:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    hello fred</pre>


<h2>USING CONTEXT: THE DEBUG FILTER
<a name="USING CONTEXT: THE DEBUG FILTER"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The rot13
example was a trivial example. Here&rsquo;s another
demonstration that shows off a few more features.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Say you wanted
to include a lot of debugging code in your Perl script
during development, but you didn&rsquo;t want it available
in the released product. Source filters offer a solution. In
order to keep the example simple, let&rsquo;s say you wanted
the debugging output to be controlled by an environment
variable, <tt>&quot;DEBUG&quot;</tt>. Debugging code is
enabled if the variable exists, otherwise it is
disabled.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Two special
marker lines will bracket debugging code, like this:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    ## DEBUG_BEGIN
    if ($year &gt; 1999) {
       warn &quot;Debug: millennium bug in year $year\n&quot;;
    }
    ## DEBUG_END</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The filter
ensures that Perl parses the code between the &lt;
<small>DEBUG_BEGIN</small> &gt; and
<tt>&quot;DEBUG_END&quot;</tt> markers only when the
<tt>&quot;DEBUG&quot;</tt> environment variable exists. That
means that when <tt>&quot;DEBUG&quot;</tt> does exist, the
code above should be passed through the filter unchanged.
The marker lines can also be passed through as-is, because
the Perl parser will see them as comment lines. When
<tt>&quot;DEBUG&quot;</tt> isn&rsquo;t set, we need a way to
disable the debug code. A simple way to achieve that is to
convert the lines between the two markers into comments:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    ## DEBUG_BEGIN
    #if ($year &gt; 1999) {
    #     warn &quot;Debug: millennium bug in year $year\n&quot;;
    #}
    ## DEBUG_END</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Here is the
complete Debug filter:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    package Debug;
    use strict;
    use warnings;
    use Filter::Util::Call;
    use constant TRUE =&gt; 1;
    use constant FALSE =&gt; 0;
    sub import {
       my ($type) = @_;
       my (%context) = (
         Enabled =&gt; defined $ENV{DEBUG},
         InTraceBlock =&gt; FALSE,
         Filename =&gt; (caller)[1],
         LineNo =&gt; 0,
         LastBegin =&gt; 0,
       );
       filter_add(bless \%context);
    }
    sub Die {
       my ($self) = shift;

       die &quot;$message at $self&minus;&gt;{Filename} line $line_no.\n&quot;
    }
    sub filter {
       my ($self) = @_;
       my ($status);
       $status = filter_read();
       ++ $self&minus;&gt;{LineNo};

           $self&minus;&gt;Die(&quot;DEBUG_BEGIN has no DEBUG_END&quot;)
               if $self&minus;&gt;{InTraceBlock};
           return $status;
       }
       if ($self&minus;&gt;{InTraceBlock}) {
          if (/^\s*##\s*DEBUG_BEGIN/ ) {
              $self&minus;&gt;Die(&quot;Nested DEBUG_BEGIN&quot;, $self&minus;&gt;{LineNo})
          } elsif (/^\s*##\s*DEBUG_END/) {
              $self&minus;&gt;{InTraceBlock} = FALSE;
          }
          # comment out the debug lines when the filter is disabled
          s/^/#/ if ! $self&minus;&gt;{Enabled};
       } elsif ( /^\s*##\s*DEBUG_BEGIN/ ) {
          $self&minus;&gt;{InTraceBlock} = TRUE;
          $self&minus;&gt;{LastBegin} = $self&minus;&gt;{LineNo};
       } elsif ( /^\s*##\s*DEBUG_END/ ) {
          $self&minus;&gt;Die(&quot;DEBUG_END has no DEBUG_BEGIN&quot;, $self&minus;&gt;{LineNo});
       }
       return $status;
    }

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The big
difference between this filter and the previous example is
the use of context data in the filter object. The filter
object is based on a hash reference, and is used to keep
various pieces of context information between calls to the
filter function. All but two of the hash fields are used for
error reporting. The first of those two, Enabled, is used by
the filter to determine whether the debugging code should be
given to the Perl parser. The second, InTraceBlock, is true
when the filter has encountered a
<tt>&quot;DEBUG_BEGIN&quot;</tt> line, but has not yet
encountered the following <tt>&quot;DEBUG_END&quot;</tt>
line.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you ignore
all the error checking that most of the code does, the
essence of the filter is as follows:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    sub filter {
       my ($self) = @_;
       my ($status);
       $status = filter_read();
       # deal with EOF/error first
       return $status if $status &lt;= 0;
       if ($self&minus;&gt;{InTraceBlock}) {
          if (/^\s*##\s*DEBUG_END/) {
             $self&minus;&gt;{InTraceBlock} = FALSE
          }
          # comment out debug lines when the filter is disabled
          s/^/#/ if ! $self&minus;&gt;{Enabled};
       } elsif ( /^\s*##\s*DEBUG_BEGIN/ ) {
          $self&minus;&gt;{InTraceBlock} = TRUE;
       }
       return $status;
    }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Be warned: just
as the C&minus;preprocessor doesn&rsquo;t know C, the Debug
filter doesn&rsquo;t know Perl. It can be fooled quite
easily:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    print &lt;&lt;EOM;
    ##DEBUG_BEGIN
    EOM</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Such things
aside, you can see that a lot can be achieved with a modest
amount of code.</p>

<h2>CONCLUSION
<a name="CONCLUSION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You now have
better understanding of what a source filter is, and you
might even have a possible use for them. If you feel like
playing with source filters but need a bit of inspiration,
here are some extra features you could add to the Debug
filter.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">First, an easy
one. Rather than having debugging code that is
all-or-nothing, it would be much more useful to be able to
control which specific blocks of debugging code get
included. Try extending the syntax for debug blocks to allow
each to be identified. The contents of the
<tt>&quot;DEBUG&quot;</tt> environment variable can then be
used to control which blocks get included.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Once you can
identify individual blocks, try allowing them to be nested.
That isn&rsquo;t difficult either.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Here is an
interesting idea that doesn&rsquo;t involve the Debug
filter. Currently Perl subroutines have fairly limited
support for formal parameter lists. You can specify the
number of parameters and their type, but you still have to
manually take them out of the <tt>@_</tt> array yourself.
Write a source filter that allows you to have a named
parameter list. Such a filter would turn this:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    sub MySub ($first, $second, @rest) { ... }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">into this:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    sub MySub($$@) {
       my ($first) = shift;
       my ($second) = shift;
       my (@rest) = @_;
       ...
    }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Finally, if you
feel like a real challenge, have a go at writing a
full-blown Perl macro preprocessor as a source filter.
Borrow the useful features from the C preprocessor and any
other macro processors you know. The tricky bit will be
choosing how much knowledge of Perl&rsquo;s syntax you want
your filter to have.</p>

<h2>THINGS TO LOOK OUT FOR
<a name="THINGS TO LOOK OUT FOR"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Some Filters
Clobber the &quot;DATA&quot; Handle</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Some source filters use the
<tt>&quot;DATA&quot;</tt> handle to read the calling
program. When using these source filters you cannot rely on
this handle, nor expect any particular kind of behavior when
operating on it. Filters based on Filter::Util::Call (and
therefore Filter::Simple) do not alter the
<tt>&quot;DATA&quot;</tt> filehandle.</p>
