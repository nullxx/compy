overview of time and timers</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Real time
and process time</b> <i><br>
Real time</i> is defined as time measured from some fixed
point, either from a standard point in the past (see the
description of the Epoch and calendar time below), or from
some point (e.g., the start) in the life of a process
(<i>elapsed time</i>).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Process
time</i> is defined as the amount of CPU time used by a
process. This is sometimes divided into <i>user</i> and
<i>system</i> components. User CPU time is the time spent
executing code in user mode. System CPU time is the time
spent by the kernel executing in system mode on behalf of
the process (e.g., executing system calls). The
<b>time</b>(1) command can be used to determine the amount
of CPU time consumed during the execution of a program. A
program can determine the amount of CPU time it has consumed
using <b>times</b>(2), <b>getrusage</b>(2), or
<b>clock</b>(3).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>The hardware
clock</b> <br>
Most computers have a (battery-powered) hardware clock which
the kernel reads at boot time in order to initialize the
software clock. For further details, see <b>rtc</b>(4) and
<b>hwclock</b>(8).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>The software
clock, HZ, and jiffies</b> <br>
The accuracy of various system calls that set timeouts,
(e.g., <b>select</b>(2), <b>sigtimedwait</b>(2)) and measure
CPU time (e.g., <b>getrusage</b>(2)) is limited by the
resolution of the <i>software clock</i>, a clock maintained
by the kernel which measures time in <i>jiffies</i>. The
size of a jiffy is determined by the value of the kernel
constant <i>HZ</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The value of
<i>HZ</i> varies across kernel versions and hardware
platforms. On i386 the situation is as follows: on kernels
up to and including 2.4.x, HZ was 100, giving a jiffy value
of 0.01 seconds; starting with 2.6.0, HZ was raised to 1000,
giving a jiffy of 0.001 seconds. Since kernel 2.6.13, the HZ
value is a kernel configuration parameter and can be 100,
250 (the default) or 1000, yielding a jiffies value of,
respectively, 0.01, 0.004, or 0.001 seconds. Since kernel
2.6.20, a further frequency is available: 300, a number that
divides evenly for the common video frame rates (PAL, 25 HZ;
NTSC, 30 HZ).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>times</b>(2) system call is a special case. It reports
times with a granularity defined by the kernel constant
<i>USER_HZ</i>. User-space applications can determine the
value of this constant using
<i>sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK)</i>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>High-resolution
timers</b> <br>
Before Linux 2.6.21, the accuracy of timer and sleep system
calls (see below) was also limited by the size of the
jiffy.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Since Linux
2.6.21, Linux supports high-resolution timers (HRTs),
optionally configurable via <b>CONFIG_HIGH_RES_TIMERS</b>.
On a system that supports HRTs, the accuracy of sleep and
timer system calls is no longer constrained by the jiffy,
but instead can be as accurate as the hardware allows
(microsecond accuracy is typical of modern hardware). You
can determine whether high-resolution timers are supported
by checking the resolution returned by a call to
<b>clock_getres</b>(2) or looking at the
&quot;resolution&quot; entries in
<i>/proc/timer_list</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">HRTs are not
supported on all hardware architectures. (Support is
provided on x86, arm, and powerpc, among others.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>The
Epoch</b> <br>
UNIX systems represent time in seconds since the
<i>Epoch</i>, 1970-01-01 00:00:00 +0000 (UTC).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A program can
determine the <i>calendar time</i> using
<b>gettimeofday</b>(2), which returns time (in seconds and
microseconds) that have elapsed since the Epoch;
<b>time</b>(2) provides similar information, but only with
accuracy to the nearest second. The system time can be
changed using <b>settimeofday</b>(2).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Broken-down
time</b> <br>
Certain library functions use a structure of type <i>tm</i>
to represent <i>broken-down time</i>, which stores time
value separated out into distinct components (year, month,
day, hour, minute, second, etc.). This structure is
described in <b>ctime</b>(3), which also describes functions
that convert between calendar time and broken-down time.
Functions for converting between broken-down time and
printable string representations of the time are described
in <b>ctime</b>(3), <b>strftime</b>(3), and
<b>strptime</b>(3).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Sleeping and
setting timers</b> <br>
Various system calls and functions allow a program to sleep
(suspend execution) for a specified period of time; see
<b>nanosleep</b>(2), <b>clock_nanosleep</b>(2), and
<b>sleep</b>(3).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Various system
calls allow a process to set a timer that expires at some
point in the future, and optionally at repeated intervals;
see <b>alarm</b>(2), <b>getitimer</b>(2),
<b>timerfd_create</b>(2), and <b>timer_create</b>(2).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Timer
slack</b> <br>
Since Linux 2.6.28, it is possible to control the
&quot;timer slack&quot; value for a thread. The timer slack
is the length of time by which the kernel may delay the
wake-up of certain system calls that block with a timeout.
Permitting this delay allows the kernel to coalesce wake-up
events, thus possibly reducing the number of system wake-ups
and saving power. For more details, see the description of
<b>PR_SET_TIMERSLACK</b> in <b>prctl</b>(2).</p>
