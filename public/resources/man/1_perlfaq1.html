&minus; General Questions About Perl</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This section of
the <small>FAQ</small> answers very general, high-level
questions about Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>What is
Perl?</b> <br>
Perl is a high-level programming language with an eclectic
heritage written by Larry Wall and a cast of thousands.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Perl&rsquo;s
process, file, and text manipulation facilities make it
particularly well-suited for tasks involving quick
prototyping, system utilities, software tools, system
management tasks, database access, graphical programming,
networking, and web programming.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Perl derives
from the ubiquitous C programming language and to a lesser
extent from sed, awk, the Unix shell, and many other tools
and languages.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These strengths
make it especially popular with web developers and system
administrators. Mathematicians, geneticists, journalists,
managers and many other people also use Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Who supports
Perl? Who develops it? Why is it free?</b> <br>
The original culture of the pre-populist Internet and the
deeply-held beliefs of Perl&rsquo;s author, Larry Wall, gave
rise to the free and open distribution policy of Perl. Perl
is supported by its users. The core, the standard Perl
library, the optional modules, and the documentation
you&rsquo;re reading now were all written by volunteers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The core
development team (known as the Perl Porters) are a group of
highly altruistic individuals committed to producing better
software for free than you could hope to purchase for money.
You may snoop on pending developments via the archives
&lt;http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/&gt;
or read the faq
&lt;http://dev.perl.org/perl5/docs/p5p-faq.html&gt;, or you
can subscribe to the mailing list by sending
perl5&minus;porters&minus;subscribe@perl.org a subscription
request (an empty message with no subject is fine).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">While the
<small>GNU</small> project includes Perl in its
distributions, there&rsquo;s no such thing as &quot;
<small>GNU</small> Perl&quot;. Perl is not produced nor
maintained by the Free Software Foundation. Perl&rsquo;s
licensing terms are also more open than <small>GNU</small>
software&rsquo;s tend to be.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can get
commercial support of Perl if you wish, although for most
users the informal support will more than suffice. See the
answer to &quot;Where can I buy a commercial version of
Perl?&quot; for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Which
version of Perl should I use?</b> <br>
(contributed by brian d foy)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There is often
a matter of opinion and taste, and there isn&rsquo;t any one
answer that fits everyone. In general, you want to use
either the current stable release, or the stable release
immediately prior to that one. Currently, those are
perl5.14.x and perl5.12.x, respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Beyond that,
you have to consider several things and decide which is best
for you.</p>

<p>There are really two tracks of perl development: a
maintenance version and an experimental version. The
maintenance versions are stable, and have an even number as
the minor release (i.e. perl5.10.x, where 10 is the minor
release). The experimental versions may include features
that don&rsquo;t make it into the stable versions, and have
an odd number as the minor release (i.e. perl5.9.x, where 9
is the minor release).</p></td></tr>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>What are
Perl 4, Perl 5, or Perl 6?</b> <br>
In short, Perl 4 is the parent to both Perl 5 and Perl 6.
Perl 5 is the older sibling, and though they are different
languages, someone who knows one will spot many similarities
in the other.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The number
after Perl (i.e. the 5 after Perl 5) is the major release of
the perl interpreter as well as the version of the language.
Each major version has significant differences that earlier
versions cannot support.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The current
major release of Perl is Perl 5, first released in 1994. It
can run scripts from the previous major release, Perl 4
(March 1991), but has significant differences.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Perl 6 is a
reinvention of Perl, it is a language in the same lineage
but not compatible. The two are complementary, not mutually
exclusive. Perl 6 is not meant to replace Perl 5, and vice
versa. See &quot;What is Perl 6?&quot; below to find out
more.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">See perlhist
for a history of Perl revisions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>What is Perl
6?</b> <br>
Perl 6 was <i>originally</i> described as the
community&rsquo;s rewrite of Perl 5. Development started in
2002; syntax and design work continue to this day. As the
language has evolved, it has become clear that it is a
separate language, incompatible with Perl 5 but in the same
language family.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Contrary to
popular belief, Perl 6 and Perl 5 peacefully coexist with
one another. Perl 6 has proven to be a fascinating source of
ideas for those using Perl 5 (the Moose object system is a
well-known example). There is overlap in the communities,
and this overlap fosters the tradition of sharing and
borrowing that have been instrumental to Perl&rsquo;s
success. The current leading implementation of Perl 6 is
Rakudo, and you can learn more about it at
&lt;http://rakudo.org&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you want to
learn more about Perl 6, or have a desire to help in the
crusade to make Perl a better place then read the Perl 6
developers page at &lt;http://www.perl6.org/&gt; and get
involved.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;We&rsquo;re
really serious about reinventing everything that needs
reinventing.&quot; &minus;&minus;Larry Wall</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>How stable
is Perl?</b> <br>
Production releases, which incorporate bug fixes and new
functionality, are widely tested before release. Since the
5.000 release, we have averaged about one production release
per year.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The Perl
development team occasionally make changes to the internal
core of the language, but all possible efforts are made
toward backward compatibility.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Is Perl
difficult to learn?</b> <br>
No, Perl is easy to start learning
&lt;http://learn.perl.org/&gt; &minus;&minus;and easy to
keep learning. It looks like most programming languages
you&rsquo;re likely to have experience with, so if
you&rsquo;ve ever written a C program, an awk script, a
shell script, or even a <small>BASIC</small> program,
you&rsquo;re already partway there.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Most tasks only
require a small subset of the Perl language. One of the
guiding mottos for Perl development is &quot;there&rsquo;s
more than one way to do it&quot; ( <small>TMTOWTDI</small> ,
sometimes pronounced &quot;tim toady&quot;). Perl&rsquo;s
learning curve is therefore shallow (easy to learn) and long
(there&rsquo;s a whole lot you can do if you really
want).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Finally,
because Perl is frequently (but not always, and certainly
not by definition) an interpreted language, you can write
your programs and test them without an intermediate
compilation step, allowing you to experiment and test/debug
quickly and easily. This ease of experimentation flattens
the learning curve even more.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Things that
make Perl easier to learn: Unix experience, almost any kind
of programming experience, an understanding of regular
expressions, and the ability to understand other
people&rsquo;s code. If there&rsquo;s something you need to
do, then it&rsquo;s probably already been done, and a
working example is usually available for free. Don&rsquo;t
forget Perl modules, either. They&rsquo;re discussed in Part
3 of this <small>FAQ</small> , along with
<small>CPAN</small> &lt;http://www.cpan.org/&gt;, which is
discussed in Part 2.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>How does
Perl compare with other languages like Java, Python,
<small>REXX</small> , Scheme, or Tcl?</b> <br>
Perl can be used for almost any coding problem, even ones
which require integrating specialist C code for extra speed.
As with any tool it can be used well or badly. Perl has many
strengths, and a few weaknesses, precisely which areas are
good and bad is often a personal choice.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When choosing a
language you should also be influenced by the resources
&lt;http://www.cpan.org/&gt;, testing culture
&lt;http://www.cpantesters.org/&gt; and community
&lt;http://www.perl.org/community.html&gt; which surrounds
it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For comparisons
to a specific language it is often best to create a small
project in both languages and compare the results, make sure
to use all the resources &lt;http://www.cpan.org/&gt; of
each language, as a language is far more than just
it&rsquo;s syntax.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Can I do
[task] in Perl?</b> <br>
Perl is flexible and extensible enough for you to use on
virtually any task, from one-line file-processing tasks to
large, elaborate systems.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For many
people, Perl serves as a great replacement for shell
scripting. For others, it serves as a convenient, high-level
replacement for most of what they&rsquo;d program in
low-level languages like C or C <small>++</small> .
It&rsquo;s ultimately up to you (and possibly your
management) which tasks you&rsquo;ll use Perl for and which
you won&rsquo;t.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you have a
library that provides an <small>API</small> , you can make
any component of it available as just another Perl function
or variable using a Perl extension written in C or C
<small>++</small> and dynamically linked into your main perl
interpreter. You can also go the other direction, and write
your main program in C or C <small>++</small> , and then
link in some Perl code on the fly, to create a powerful
application. See perlembed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">That said,
there will always be small, focused, special-purpose
languages dedicated to a specific problem domain that are
simply more convenient for certain kinds of problems. Perl
tries to be all things to all people, but nothing special to
anyone. Examples of specialized languages that come to mind
include prolog and matlab.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>When
shouldn&rsquo;t I program in Perl?</b> <br>
One good reason is when you already have an existing
application written in another language that&rsquo;s all
done (and done well), or you have an application language
specifically designed for a certain task (e.g. prolog,
make).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you find
that you need to speed up a specific part of a Perl
application (not something you often need) you may want to
use C, but you can access this from your Perl code with
perlxs.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>What&rsquo;s
the difference between &quot;perl&quot; and
&quot;Perl&quot;?</b> <br>
&quot;Perl&quot; is the name of the language. Only the
&quot;P&quot; is capitalized. The name of the interpreter
(the program which runs the Perl script) is &quot;perl&quot;
with a lowercase &quot;p&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You may or may
not choose to follow this usage. But never write &quot;
<small>PERL</small> &quot;, because perl is not an
acronym.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>What is a
<small>JAPH</small> ?</b> <br>
(contributed by brian d foy)</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><small>JAPH</small>
stands for &quot;Just another Perl hacker,&quot;, which
Randal Schwartz used to sign email and usenet messages
starting in the late 1980s. He previously used the phrase
with many subjects (&quot;Just another x hacker,&quot;), so
to distinguish his <small>JAPH</small> , he started to write
them as Perl programs:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    print &quot;Just another Perl hacker,&quot;;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Other people
picked up on this and started to write clever or obfuscated
programs to produce the same output, spinning things quickly
out of control while still providing hours of amusement for
their creators and readers.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><small>CPAN</small>
has several <small>JAPH</small> programs at
&lt;http://www.cpan.org/misc/japh&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>How can I
convince others to use Perl?</b> <br>
(contributed by brian d foy)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Appeal to their
self interest! If Perl is new (and thus scary) to them, find
something that Perl can do to solve one of their problems.
That might mean that Perl either saves them something (time,
headaches, money) or gives them something (flexibility,
power, testability).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In general, the
benefit of a language is closely related to the skill of the
people using that language. If you or your team can be
faster, better, and stronger through Perl, you&rsquo;ll
deliver more value. Remember, people often respond better to
what they get out of it. If you run into resistance, figure
out what those people get out of the other choice and how
Perl might satisfy that requirement.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You don&rsquo;t
have to worry about finding or paying for Perl; it&rsquo;s
freely available and several popular operating systems come
with Perl. Community support in places such as Perlmonks (
&lt;http://www.perlmonks.com&gt; ) and the various Perl
mailing lists ( &lt;http://lists.perl.org&gt; ) means that
you can usually get quick answers to your problems.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Finally, keep
in mind that Perl might not be the right tool for every job.
You&rsquo;re a much better advocate if your claims are
reasonable and grounded in reality. Dogmatically advocating
anything tends to make people discount your message. Be
honest about possible disadvantages to your choice of Perl
since any choice has trade-offs.</p>
