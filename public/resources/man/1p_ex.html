<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This manual
page is part of the POSIX Programmer&rsquo;s Manual. The
Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult
the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux
behavior), or the interface may not be implemented on
Linux.</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>ex [-rR][-s
| -v][-c</b> <i>command</i><b>][-t</b>
<i>tagstring</i><b>][-w</b> <i>size</i><b>][</b><i>file</i>
<b>...]</b></p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The <i>ex</i>
utility is a line-oriented text editor. There are two other
modes of the editor-open and visual-in which screen-oriented
editing is available. This is described more fully by the
<i>ex</i> <b>open</b> and <b>visual</b> commands and in
<i>vi</i> .</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This section
uses the term <i>edit buffer</i> to describe the current
working text. No specific implementation is implied by this
term. All editing changes are performed on the edit buffer,
and no changes to it shall affect any file until an editor
command writes the file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Certain
terminals do not have all the capabilities necessary to
support the complete <i>ex</i> definition, such as the
full-screen editing commands ( <i>visual mode</i> or <i>open
mode</i>). When these commands cannot be supported on such
terminals, this condition shall not produce an error message
such as &quot;not an editor command&quot; or report a syntax
error. The implementation may either accept the commands and
produce results on the screen that are the result of an
unsuccessful attempt to meet the requirements of this volume
of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 or report an error
describing the terminal-related deficiency.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The <i>ex</i>
utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax
Guidelines.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
options shall be supported: <b><br>
-c&nbsp;</b> <i>command</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specify an initial command to
be executed in the first edit buffer loaded from an existing
file (see the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION section). Implementations
may support more than a single <b>-c</b> option. In such
implementations, the specified commands shall be executed in
the order specified on the command line.</p>

<p>Recover the named files (see the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
section). Recovery information for a file shall be saved
during an editor or system crash (for example, when the
editor is terminated by a signal which the editor can
catch), or after the use of an <i>ex</i> <b>preserve</b>
command.</p> </td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A <i>crash</i>
in this context is an unexpected failure of the system or
utility that requires restarting the failed system or
utility. A system crash implies that any utilities running
at the time also crash. In the case of an editor or system
crash, the number of changes to the edit buffer (since the
most recent <b>preserve</b> command) that will be recovered
is unspecified.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If no
<i>file</i> operands are given and the <b>-t</b> option is
not specified, all other options, the <i>EXINIT</i>
variable, and any <b>.exrc</b> files shall be ignored; a
list of all recoverable files available to the invoking user
shall be written, and the editor shall exit normally without
further action.</p>

the standard input returns an error, or if the editor
detects an end-of-file condition from the standard input, it
shall be equivalent to a SIGHUP asynchronous event.</p>

<h2>INPUT FILES

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Input files
shall be text files or files that would be text files except
for an incomplete last line that is not longer than
{LINE_MAX}-1 bytes in length and contains no NUL characters.
By default, any incomplete last line shall be treated as if
it had a trailing &lt;newline&gt;. The editing of other
forms of files may optionally be allowed by <i>ex</i>
implementations.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The <i>ex</i>/
<i>vi</i> specification is based on the historical practice
found in the 4 BSD and System V implementations of <i>ex</i>
and <i>vi</i>. A freely redistributable implementation of
<i>ex</i>/ <i>vi</i>, which is tracking
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 fairly closely, and
demonstrates the intended changes between historical
implementations and IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001, may be
obtained by anonymous FTP from:</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>ftp://ftp.rdg.opengroup.org/pub/mirrors/nvi</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A <i>restricted
editor</i> (both the historical <i>red</i> utility and
modifications to <i>ex</i>) were considered and rejected for
inclusion. Neither option provided the level of security
that users might expect.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is
recognized that <i>ex</i> visual mode and related features
would be difficult, if not impossible, to implement
satisfactorily on a block-mode terminal, or a terminal
without any form of cursor addressing; thus, it is not a
mandatory requirement that such features should work on all
terminals. It is the intention, however, that an <i>ex</i>
implementation should provide the full set of capabilities
on all terminals capable of supporting them.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Options</b>
<br>
The <b>-c</b> replacement for <b>+</b> <i>command</i> was
inspired by the <b>-e</b> option of <i>sed</i>.
Historically, all such commands (see <b>edit</b> and
<b>next</b> as well) were executed from the last line of the
edit buffer. This meant, for example, that
<b>&quot;+/pattern&quot;</b> would fail unless the
<b>wrapscan</b> option was set.
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires conformance to
historical practice. Historically, some implementations
restricted the <i>ex</i> commands that could be listed as
part of the command line arguments. For consistency,
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 does not permit these
restrictions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In historical
implementations of the editor, the <b>-R</b> option (and the
<b>readonly</b> edit option) only prevented overwriting of
files; appending to files was still permitted, mapping
loosely into the <i>csh</i> <b>noclobber</b> variable. Some
implementations, however, have not followed this semantic,
and <b>readonly</b> does not permit appending either.
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 follows the latter practice,
believing that it is a more obvious and intuitive meaning of
<b>readonly</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The <b>-s</b>
option suppresses all interactive user feedback and is
useful for editing scripts in batch jobs. The list of
specific effects is historical practice. The terminal type
&quot;incapable of supporting open and visual modes&quot;
has historically been named &quot;dumb&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The <b>-t</b>
option was required because the <i>ctags</i> utility appears
in IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 and the option is
available in all historical implementations of
<i>ex</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Historically,
the <i>ex</i> and <i>vi</i> utilities accepted a <b>-x</b>
option, which did encryption based on the algorithm found in
the historical <i>crypt</i> utility. The <b>-x</b> option
for encryption, and the associated <i>crypt</i> utility,
were omitted because the algorithm used was not specifiable
and the export control laws of some nations make it
difficult to export cryptographic technology. In addition,
it did not historically provide the level of security that
users might expect.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Standard
Input</b> <br>
An end-of-file condition is not equivalent to an end-of-file
character. A common end-of-file character,
&lt;control&gt;-D, is historically an <i>ex</i> command.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There was no
maximum line length in historical implementations of
<i>ex</i>. Specifically, as it was parsed in chunks, the
addresses had a different maximum length than the filenames.
Further, the maximum line buffer size was declared as
BUFSIZ, which was different lengths on different systems.
This version selected the value of {LINE_MAX} to impose a
reasonable restriction on portable usage of <i>ex</i> and to
aid test suite writers in their development of realistic
tests that exercise this limit.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Input
Files</b> <br>
It was an explicit decision by the standard developers that
a &lt;newline&gt; be added to any file lacking one. It was
believed that this feature of <i>ex</i> and <i>vi</i> was
relied on by users in order to make text files lacking a
trailing &lt;newline&gt; more portable. It is recognized
that this will require a user-specified option or extension
for implementations that permit <i>ex</i> and <i>vi</i> to
edit files of type other than text if such files are not
otherwise identified by the system. It was agreed that the
ability to edit files of arbitrary type can be useful, but
it was not considered necessary to mandate that an <i>ex</i>
or <i>vi</i> implementation be required to handle files
other than text files.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The paragraph
in the INPUT FILES section, &quot;By default, ...&quot;, is
intended to close a long-standing security problem in
<i>ex</i> and <i>vi</i>; that of the &quot;modeline&quot; or
&quot;modelines&quot; edit option. This feature allows any
line in the first or last five lines of the file containing
the strings <b>&quot;ex:&quot;</b> or <b>&quot;vi:&quot;</b>
(and, apparently, <b>&quot;ei:&quot;</b> or
<b>&quot;vx:&quot;</b> ) to be a line containing editor
commands, and <i>ex</i> interprets all the text up to the
next <b>&rsquo;:&rsquo;</b> or &lt;newline&gt; as a command.
Consider the consequences, for example, of an unsuspecting
user using <i>ex</i> or <i>vi</i> as the editor when
replying to a mail message in which a line such as:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>ex:! rm -rf
:</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">appeared in the
signature lines. The standard developers believed strongly
that an editor should not by default interpret any lines of
a file. Vendors are strongly urged to delete this feature
from their implementations of <i>ex</i> and <i>vi</i>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Asynchronous
Events</b> <br>
The intention of the phrase &quot;complete write&quot; is
that the entire edit buffer be written to stable storage.
The note regarding temporary files is intended for
implementations that use temporary files to back edit
buffers unnamed by the user.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Historically,
SIGQUIT was ignored by <i>ex</i>, but was the equivalent of
the <b>Q</b> command in visual mode; that is, it exited
visual mode and entered <i>ex</i> mode.
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 permits, but does not
require, this behavior. Historically, SIGINT was often used
by <i>vi</i> users to terminate text input mode (
&lt;control&gt;-C is often easier to enter than
&lt;ESC&gt;). Some implementations of <i>vi</i> alerted the
terminal on this event, and some did not.
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires that SIGINT behave
identically to &lt;ESC&gt;, and that the terminal not be
alerted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Historically,
suspending the <i>ex</i> editor during text input mode was
similar to SIGINT, as completed lines were retained, but any
partial line discarded, and the editor returned to command
mode. IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 is silent on this
issue; implementations are encouraged to follow historical
practice, where possible.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Historically,
the <i>vi</i> editor did not treat SIGTSTP as an
asynchronous event, and it was therefore impossible to
suspend the editor in visual text input mode. There are two
major reasons for this. The first is that SIGTSTP is a
broadcast signal on UNIX systems, and the chain of events
where the shell <i>exec</i>s an application that then
<i>exec</i>s <i>vi</i> usually caused confusion for the
terminal state if SIGTSTP was delivered to the process group
in the default manner. The second was that most
implementations of the UNIX <i>curses</i> package are not
reentrant, and the receipt of SIGTSTP at the wrong time will
cause them to crash. IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 is
silent on this issue; implementations are encouraged to
treat suspension as an asynchronous event if possible.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Historically,
modifications to the edit buffer made before SIGINT
interrupted an operation were retained; that is, anywhere
from zero to all of the lines to be modified might have been
modified by the time the SIGINT arrived. These changes were
not discarded by the arrival of SIGINT.
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 permits this behavior, noting
that the <b>undo</b> command is required to be able to undo
these partially completed commands.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The action
taken for signals other than SIGINT, SIGCONT, SIGHUP, and
SIGTERM is unspecified because some implementations attempt
to save the edit buffer in a useful state when other signals
are received.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Standard
Error</b> <br>
For <i>ex</i>/ <i>vi</i>, diagnostic messages are those
messages reported as a result of a failed attempt to invoke
<i>ex</i> or <i>vi</i>, such as invalid options or
insufficient resources, or an abnormal termination
condition. Diagnostic messages should not be confused with
the error messages generated by inappropriate or illegal
user commands.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Initialization
in ex and vi</b> <br>
If an <i>ex</i> command (other than <b>cd</b>, <b>chdir</b>,
or <b>source</b>) has a filename argument, one or both of
the alternate and current pathnames will be set. Informally,
they are set as follows:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="12%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">1.</p></td>
<td width="2%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the <i>ex</i> command is one
that replaces the contents of the edit buffer, and it
succeeds, the current pathname will be set to the filename
argument (the first filename argument in the case of the
<b>next</b> command) and the alternate pathname will be set
to the previous current pathname, if there was one.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="12%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p>2.</p></td>
<td width="2%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>In the case of the file read/write forms of the
<b>read</b> and <b>write</b> commands, if there is no
current pathname, the current pathname will be set to the
filename argument.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="12%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p>3.</p></td>
<td width="2%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>Otherwise, the alternate pathname will be set to the
filename argument.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For example,
<b>:edit foo</b> and <b>:recover foo</b>, when successful,
set the current pathname, and, if there was a previous
current pathname, the alternate pathname. The commands
<b>:write</b>, <b>!command</b>, and <b>:edit</b> set neither
the current or alternate pathnames. If the <b>:edit foo</b>
command were to fail for some reason, the alternate pathname
would be set. The <b>read</b> and <b>write</b> commands set
the alternate pathname to their <i>file</i> argument, unless
the current pathname is not set, in which case they set the
current pathname to their <i>file</i> arguments. The
alternate pathname was not historically set by the
<b>:source</b> command. IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001
requires conformance to historical practice. Implementations
adding commands that take filenames as arguments are
encouraged to set the alternate pathname as described
here.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Historically,
<i>ex</i> and <i>vi</i> read the <b>.exrc</b> file in the
<i>$HOME</i> directory twice, if the editor was executed in
the <i>$HOME</i> directory. IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001
prohibits this behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Historically,
the 4 BSD <i>ex</i> and <i>vi</i> read the <i>$HOME</i> and
local <b>.exrc</b> files if they were owned by the real ID
of the user, or the <b>sourceany</b> option was set,
regardless of other considerations. This was a security
problem because it is possible to put normal UNIX system
commands inside a <b>.exrc</b> file.
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 does not specify the
<b>sourceany</b> option, and historical implementations are
encouraged to delete it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>.exrc</b> files must be owned by the real ID of the user,
and not writable by anyone other than the owner. The
appropriate privileges exception is intended to permit users
to acquire special privileges, but continue to use the
<b>.exrc</b> files in their home directories.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">System V
Release 3.2 and later <i>vi</i> implementations added the
option <b>[no]exrc</b>. The behavior is that local
<b>.exrc</b> files are read-only if the <b>exrc</b> option
is set. The default for the <b>exrc</b> option was off, so
by default, local <b>.exrc</b> files were not read. The
problem this was intended to solve was that System V
permitted users to give away files, so there is no possible
ownership or writeability test to ensure that the file is
safe. This is still a security problem on systems where
users can give away files, but there is nothing additional
that IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 can do. The
implementation-defined exception is intended to permit
groups to have local <b>.exrc</b> files that are shared by
users, by creating pseudo-users to own the shared files.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001
does not mention system-wide <i>ex</i> and <i>vi</i>
start-up files. While they exist in several implementations
of <i>ex</i> and <i>vi</i>, they are not present in any
implementations considered historical practice by
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001. Implementations that have
such files should use them only if they are owned by the
real user ID or an appropriate user (for example, root on
UNIX systems) and if they are not writable by any user other
than their owner. System-wide start-up files should be read
before the <i>EXINIT</i> variable, <b>$HOME/.exrc</b>, or
local <b>.exrc</b> files are evaluated.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Historically,
any <i>ex</i> command could be entered in the <i>EXINIT</i>
variable or the <b>.exrc</b> file, although ones requiring
that the edit buffer already contain lines of text generally
caused historical implementations of the editor to drop
<b>core</b>. IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires that
any <i>ex</i> command be permitted in the <i>EXINIT</i>
variable and <b>.exrc</b> files, for simplicity of
specification and consistency, although many of them will
obviously fail under many circumstances.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
initialization of the contents of the edit buffer uses the
phrase &quot;the effect shall be&quot; with regard to
various <i>ex</i> commands. The intent of this phrase is
that edit buffer contents loaded during the initialization
phase not be lost; that is, loading the edit buffer should
fail if the <b>.exrc</b> file read in the contents of a file
and did not subsequently write the edit buffer. An
additional intent of this phrase is to specify that the
initial current line and column is set as specified for the
individual <i>ex</i> commands.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Historically,
the <b>-t</b> option behaved as if the tag search were a
<b>+</b> <i>command</i>; that is, it was executed from the
last line of the file specified by the tag. This resulted in
the search failing if the pattern was a forward search
pattern and the <b>wrapscan</b> edit option was not set.
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 does not permit this
behavior, requiring that the search for the tag pattern be
performed on the entire file, and, if not found, that the
current line be set to a more reasonable location in the
file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Historically,
the empty edit buffer presented for editing when a file was
not specified by the user was unnamed. This is permitted by
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001; however, implementations are
encouraged to provide users a temporary filename for this
buffer because it permits them the use of <i>ex</i> commands
that use the current pathname during temporary edit
sessions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Historically,
the file specified using the <b>-t</b> option was not part
of the current argument list. This practice is permitted by
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001; however, implementations are
encouraged to include its name in the current argument list
for consistency.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Historically,
the <b>-c</b> command was generally not executed until a
file that already exists was edited.
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires conformance to this
historical practice. Commands that could cause the <b>-c</b>
command to be executed include the <i>ex</i> commands
<b>edit</b>, <b>next</b>, <b>recover</b>, <b>rewind</b>, and
<b>tag</b>, and the <i>vi</i> commands &lt;control&gt;-^ and
&lt;control&gt;-]. Historically, reading a file into an edit
buffer did not cause the <b>-c</b> command to be executed
(even though it might set the current pathname) with the
exception that it did cause the <b>-c</b> command to be
executed if: the editor was in <i>ex</i> mode, the edit
buffer had no current pathname, the edit buffer was empty,
and no read commands had yet been attempted. For consistency
and simplicity of specification,
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 does not permit this
behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Historically,
the <b>-r</b> option was the same as a normal edit session
if there was no recovery information available for the file.
This allowed users to enter:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>vi -r
*.c</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">and recover
whatever files were recoverable. In some implementations,
recovery was attempted only on the first file named, and the
file was not entered into the argument list; in others,
recovery was attempted for each file named. In addition,
some historical implementations ignored <b>-r</b> if
<b>-t</b> was specified or did not support command line
<i>file</i> arguments with the <b>-t</b> option. For
consistency and simplicity of specification,
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 disallows these special
cases, and requires that recovery be attempted the first
time each file is edited.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Historically,
<i>vi</i> initialized the <b>&lsquo;</b> and <b>&rsquo;</b>
marks, but <i>ex</i> did not. This meant that if the first
command in <i>ex</i> mode was <b>visual</b> or if an
<i>ex</i> command was executed first (for example, <i>vi</i>
+10 <i>file</i>), <i>vi</i> was entered without the marks
being initialized. Because the standard developers believed
the marks to be generally useful, and for consistency and
simplicity of specification, IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001
requires that they always be initialized if in open or
visual mode, or if in <i>ex</i> mode and the edit buffer is
not empty. Not initializing it in <i>ex</i> mode if the edit
buffer is empty is historical practice; however, it has
always been possible to set (and use) marks in empty edit
buffers in open and visual mode edit sessions.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Addressing</b>
<br>
Historically, <i>ex</i> and <i>vi</i> accepted the
additional addressing forms <b>&rsquo;\/&rsquo;</b> and
<b>&rsquo;\?&rsquo;</b> . They were equivalent to
<b>&quot;//&quot;</b> and <b>&quot;??&quot;</b>,
respectively. They are not required by
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001, mostly because nobody can
remember whether they ever did anything different
historically.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Historically,
<i>ex</i> and <i>vi</i> permitted an address of zero for
several commands, and permitted the <b>%</b> address in
empty files for others. For consistency,
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires support for the
former in the few commands where it makes sense, and
disallows it otherwise. In addition, because
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires that <b>%</b> be
logically equivalent to <b>&quot;1,$&quot;</b>, it is also
supported where it makes sense and disallowed otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Historically,
the <b>%</b> address could not be followed by further
addresses. For consistency and simplicity of specification,
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires that additional
addresses be supported.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">All of the
following are valid <i>addresses</i>:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"

</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Any number of
addresses can be provided to commands taking addresses; for
example, <b>&quot;1,2,3,4,5p&quot;</b> prints lines 4 and 5,
because two is the greatest valid number of addresses
accepted by the <b>print</b> command. This, in combination
with the semicolon delimiter, permits users to create
commands based on ordered patterns in the file. For example,
the command <b>3;/foo/;+2print</b> will display the first
line after line 3 that contains the pattern <i>foo</i>, plus
the next two lines. Note that the address <b>3;</b> must be
evaluated before being discarded because the search origin
for the <b>/foo/</b> command depends on this.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Historically,
values could be added to addresses by including them after
one or more &lt;blank&gt;s; for example,
<b>3&nbsp;-&nbsp;5p</b> wrote the seventh line of the file,
and <b>/foo/&nbsp;5</b> was the same as <b>/foo/+5</b>.
However, only absolute values could be added; for example,
<b>5&nbsp;/foo/</b> was an error.
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires conformance to
historical practice. Address offsets are separately
specified from addresses because they could historically be
provided to visual mode search commands.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Historically,
any missing addresses defaulted to the current line. This
was true for leading and trailing comma-delimited addresses,
and for trailing semicolon-delimited addresses. For
consistency, IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires it for
leading semicolon addresses as well.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Historically,
<i>ex</i> and <i>vi</i> accepted the <b>&rsquo;^&rsquo;</b>
character as both an address and as a flag offset for
commands. In both cases it was identical to the
<b>&rsquo;-&rsquo;</b> character.
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 does not require or prohibit
this behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Historically,
the enhancements to basic regular expressions could be used
in addressing; for example, <b>&rsquo;~&rsquo;</b>,
<b>&rsquo;\&lt;&rsquo;</b>, and <b>&rsquo;\&gt;&rsquo;</b> .
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires conformance to
historical practice; that is, that regular expression usage
be consistent, and that regular expression enhancements be
supported wherever regular expressions are used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Command Line
Parsing in ex</b> <br>
Historical <i>ex</i> command parsing was even more complex
than that described here. IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001
requires the subset of the command parsing that the standard
developers believed was documented and that users could
reasonably be expected to use in a portable fashion, and
that was historically consistent between implementations.
(The discarded functionality is obscure, at best.)
Historical implementations will require changes in order to
comply with IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001; however, users
are not expected to notice any of these changes. Most of the
complexity in <i>ex</i> parsing is to handle three special
termination cases:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The <b>!</b>, <b>global</b>,
<b>v</b>, and the filter versions of the <b>read</b> and

shell pipes).</p></td></tr>

<td width="2%"></td>

<td width="12%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p>3.</p></td>
<td width="2%"></td>

<p>The <b>s</b> command takes a regular expression as its
first argument, and uses the delimiting characters to
delimit the command.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Historically,
vertical-line characters in the <b>+</b> <i>command</i>
argument of the <b>ex</b>, <b>edit</b>, <b>next</b>,
<b>vi</b>, and <b>visual</b> commands, and in the
<i>pattern</i> and <i>replacement</i> parts of the <b>s</b>
command, did not delimit the command, and in the filter
cases for <b>read</b> and <b>write</b>, and the <b>!</b>,
<b>global</b>, and <b>v</b> commands, they did not delimit
the command at all. For example, the following commands are
all valid:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>:edit +25 |
s/abc/ABC/ file.c <br>
:s/ | /PIPE/ <br>
:read !spell % | columnate <br>
:global/pattern/p | l <br>
:s/a/b/ | s/c/d | set</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Historically,
empty or &lt;blank&gt; filled lines in <b>.exrc</b> files
and <b>source</b>d files (as well as <i>EXINIT</i> variables
and <i>ex</i> command scripts) were treated as default
commands; that is, <b>print</b> commands.
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 specifically requires that
they be ignored when encountered in <b>.exrc</b> and
<b>source</b>d files to eliminate a common source of new
user error.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Historically,
<i>ex</i> commands with multiple adjacent (or
&lt;blank&gt;-separated) vertical lines were handled oddly
when executed from <i>ex</i> mode. For example, the command
<b>|||</b> &lt;carriage-return&gt;, when the cursor was on
line 1, displayed lines 2, 3, and 5 of the file. In
addition, the command <b>|</b> would only display the line
after the next line, instead of the next two lines. The
former worked more logically when executed from <i>vi</i>
mode, and displayed lines 2, 3, and 4.
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires the <i>vi</i>
behavior; that is, a single default command and line number
increment for each command separator, and trailing
&lt;newline&gt;s after vertical-line separators are
discarded.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Historically,
<i>ex</i> permitted a single extra colon as a leading
command character; for example, <b>:g/pattern/:p</b> was a
valid command. IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 generalizes
this to require that any number of leading colon characters
be stripped.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Historically,
any prefix of the <b>delete</b> command could be followed
without intervening &lt;blank&gt;s by a flag character
because in the command <b>d&nbsp;p</b>, <i>p</i> is
interpreted as the buffer <i>p</i>.
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires conformance to
historical practice.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Historically,
the <b>k</b> command could be followed by the mark name
without intervening &lt;blank&gt;s.
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires conformance to
historical practice.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Historically,
the <b>s</b> command could be immediately followed by flag
and option characters; for example, <b>s/e/E/|s|sgc3p</b>
was a valid command. However, flag characters could not
stand alone; for example, the commands <b>sp</b> and
<b>s&nbsp;l</b> would fail, while the command <b>sgp</b> and
<b>s&nbsp;gl</b> would succeed. (Obviously, the
<b>&rsquo;#&rsquo;</b> flag character was used as a
delimiter character if it followed the command.) Another
issue was that option characters had to precede flag
characters even when the command was fully specified; for
example, the command <b>s/e/E/pg</b> would fail, while the
command <b>s/e/E/gp</b> would succeed.
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires conformance to
historical practice.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Historically,
the first command name that had a prefix matching the input
from the user was the executed command; for example,
<b>ve</b>, <b>ver</b>, and <b>vers</b> all executed the
<b>version</b> command. Commands were in a specific order,
however, so that <b>a</b> matched <b>append</b>, not
<b>abbreviate</b>. IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires
conformance to historical practice. The restriction on
command search order for implementations with extensions is
to avoid the addition of commands such that the historical
prefixes would fail to work portably.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Historical
implementations of <i>ex</i> and <i>vi</i> did not correctly
handle multiple <i>ex</i> commands, separated by
vertical-line characters, that entered or exited visual mode
or the editor. Because implementations of <i>vi</i> exist
that do not exhibit this failure mode,
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 does not permit it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The requirement
that alphabetic command names consist of all following
alphabetic characters up to the next non-alphabetic
character means that alphabetic command names must be
separated from their arguments by one or more non-alphabetic
characters, normally a &lt;blank&gt; or
<b>&rsquo;!&rsquo;</b> character, except as specified for
the exceptions, the <b>delete</b>, <b>k</b>, and <b>s</b>
commands.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Historically,
the repeated execution of the <i>ex</i> default <b>print</b>
commands ( &lt;control&gt;-D, <i>eof</i>, &lt;newline&gt;,
&lt;carriage-return&gt;) erased any prompting character and
displayed the next lines without scrolling the terminal;
that is, immediately below any previously displayed lines.
This provided a cleaner presentation of the lines in the
file for the user. IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 does not
require this behavior because it may be impossible in some
situations; however, implementations are strongly encouraged
to provide this semantic if possible.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Historically,
it was possible to change files in the middle of a command,
and have the rest of the command executed in the new file;
for example:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>:edit +25
file.c | s/abc/ABC/ | 1</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">was a valid
command, and the substitution was attempted in the newly
edited file. IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires
conformance to historical practice. The following commands
are examples that exercise the <i>ex</i> parser:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>echo
&rsquo;foo | bar&rsquo; &gt; file1; echo
&rsquo;foo/bar&rsquo; &gt; file2; <br>
vi <br>
:edit +1 | s/|/PIPE/ | w file1 | e file2 | 1 | s/\//SLASH/ |
wq</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Historically,
there was no protection in editor implementations to avoid
<i>ex</i> <b>global</b>, <b>v</b>, <b>@</b>, or <b>*</b>
commands changing edit buffers during execution of their
associated commands. Because this would almost invariably
result in catastrophic failure of the editor, and
implementations exist that do exhibit these problems,
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires that changing the
edit buffer during a <b>global</b> or <b>v</b> command, or
during a <b>@</b> or <b>*</b> command for which there will
be more than a single execution, be an error.
Implementations supporting multiple edit buffers
simultaneously are strongly encouraged to apply the same
semantics to switching between buffers as well.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The <i>ex</i>
command quoting required by IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001
is a superset of the quoting in historical implementations
of the editor. For example, it was not historically possible
to escape a &lt;blank&gt; in a filename; for example,
<b>:edit&nbsp;foo\\\&nbsp;bar</b> would report that too many
filenames had been entered for the edit command, and there
was no method of escaping a &lt;blank&gt; in the first
argument of an <b>edit</b>, <b>ex</b>, <b>next</b>, or
<b>visual</b> command at all. IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001
extends historical practice, requiring that quoting behavior
be made consistent across all <i>ex</i> commands, except for
the <b>map</b>, <b>unmap</b>, <b>abbreviate</b>, and
<b>unabbreviate</b> commands, which historically used
&lt;control&gt;-V instead of backslashes for quoting. For
those four commands, IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires
conformance to historical practice.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Backslash
quoting in <i>ex</i> is non-intuitive. Backslash escapes are
ignored unless they escape a special character; for example,
when performing <i>file</i> argument expansion, the string
<b>&quot;\\%&quot;</b> is equivalent to
<b>&rsquo;\%&rsquo;</b>, not
<b>&quot;\&lt;</b><i>current&nbsp;pathname</i><b>&gt;&quot;</b>.
This can be confusing for users because backslash is usually
one of the characters that causes shell expansion to be
performed, and therefore shell quoting rules must be taken
into consideration. Generally, quoting characters are only
considered if they escape a special character, and a quoting
character must be provided for each layer of parsing for
which the character is special. As another example, only a
single backslash is necessary for the
<b>&rsquo;\l&rsquo;</b> sequence in substitute replacement
patterns, because the character <b>&rsquo;l&rsquo;</b> is
not special to any parsing layer above it.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&lt;control&gt;-V
quoting in <i>ex</i> is slightly different from backslash
quoting. In the four commands where &lt;control&gt;-V
quoting applies ( <b>abbreviate</b>, <b>unabbreviate</b>,
<b>map</b>, and <b>unmap</b>), any character may be escaped
by a &lt;control&gt;-V whether it would have a special
meaning or not. IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires
conformance to historical practice.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Historical
implementations of the editor did not require delimiters
within character classes to be escaped; for example, the
command <b>:s/[/]//</b> on the string
<b>&quot;xxx/yyy&quot;</b> would delete the
<b>&rsquo;/&rsquo;</b> from the string.
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 disallows this historical
practice for consistency and because it places a large
burden on implementations by requiring that knowledge of
regular expressions be built into the editor parser.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Historically,
quoting &lt;newline&gt;s in <i>ex</i> commands was handled
inconsistently. In most cases, the &lt;newline&gt; always
terminated the command, regardless of any preceding escape
character, because backslash characters did not escape
&lt;newline&gt;s for most <i>ex</i> commands. However, some
<i>ex</i> commands (for example, <b>s</b>, <b>map</b>, and
<b>abbreviation</b>) permitted &lt;newline&gt;s to be
escaped (although in the case of <b>map</b> and
<b>abbreviation</b>, &lt;control&gt;-V characters escaped
them instead of backslashes). This was true in not only the
command line, but also <b>.exrc</b> and <b>source</b>d
files. For example, the command:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>map =
foo&lt;control-V&gt;&lt;newline&gt;bar</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">would succeed,
although it was sometimes difficult to get the
&lt;control&gt;-V and the inserted &lt;newline&gt; passed to
the <i>ex</i> parser. For consistency and simplicity of
specification, IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires that
it be possible to escape &lt;newline&gt;s in <i>ex</i>
commands at all times, using backslashes for most <i>ex</i>
commands, and using &lt;control&gt;-V characters for the
<b>map</b> and <b>abbreviation</b> commands. For example,
the command <b>print</b> &lt;newline&gt; <b>list</b> is
required to be parsed as the single command <b>print</b>
&lt;newline&gt; <b>list</b>. While this differs from
historical practice, IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001
developers believed it unlikely that any script or user
depended on the historical behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Historically,
an error in a command specified using the <b>-c</b> option
did not cause the rest of the <b>-c</b> commands to be
discarded. IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 disallows this for
consistency with mapped keys, the <b>@</b>, <b>global</b>,
<b>source</b>, and <b>v</b> commands, the <i>EXINIT</i>
environment variable, and the <b>.exrc</b> files.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Input
Editing in ex</b> <br>
One of the common uses of the historical <i>ex</i> editor is
over slow network connections. Editors that run in canonical
mode can require far less traffic to and from, and far less
processing on, the host machine, as well as more easily
supporting block-mode terminals. For these reasons,
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires that <i>ex</i> be
implemented using canonical mode input processing, as was
done historically.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001
does not require the historical 4 BSD input editing
characters &quot;word erase&quot; or &quot;literal
next&quot;. For this reason, it is unspecified how they are
handled by <i>ex</i>, although they must have the required
effect. Implementations that resolve them after the line has
been ended using a &lt;newline&gt; or &lt;control&gt;-M
character, and implementations that rely on the underlying
system terminal support for this processing, are both
conforming. Implementations are strongly urged to use the
underlying system functionality, if at all possible, for
compatibility with other system text input interfaces.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Historically,
when the <i>eof</i> character was used to decrement the
<b>autoindent</b> level, the cursor moved to display the new
end of the <b>autoindent</b> characters, but did not move
the cursor to a new line, nor did it erase the
&lt;control&gt;-D character from the line.
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 does not specify that the
cursor remain on the same line or that the rest of the line
is erased; however, implementations are strongly encouraged
to provide the best possible user interface; that is, the
cursor should remain on the same line, and any
&lt;control&gt;-D character on the line should be
erased.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001
does not require the historical 4 BSD input editing
character &quot;reprint&quot;, traditionally
&lt;control&gt;-R, which redisplayed the current input from
the user. For this reason, and because the functionality
cannot be implemented after the line has been terminated by
the user, IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 makes no
requirements about this functionality. Implementations are
strongly urged to make this historical functionality
available, if possible.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Historically,
&lt;control&gt;-Q did not perform a literal next function in
<i>ex</i>, as it did in <i>vi</i>.
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires conformance to
historical practice to avoid breaking historical <i>ex</i>
scripts and <b>.exrc</b> files.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>eof</b> <br>
Whether the <i>eof</i> character immediately modifies the
<b>autoindent</b> characters in the prompt is left
unspecified so that implementations can conform in the
presence of systems that do not support this functionality.
Implementations are encouraged to modify the line and
redisplay it immediately, if possible.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
specification of the handling of the <i>eof</i> character
differs from historical practice only in that <i>eof</i>
characters are not discarded if they follow normal
characters in the text input. Historically, they were always
discarded.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Command
Descriptions in ex</b> <br>
Historically, several commands (for example, <b>global</b>,
<b>v</b>, <b>visual</b>, <b>s</b>, <b>write</b>, <b>wq</b>,
<b>yank</b>, <b>!</b>, <b>&lt;</b>, <b>&gt;</b>,
<b>&amp;</b>, and <b>~</b>) were executable in empty files
(that is, the default address(es) were 0), or permitted
explicit addresses of 0 (for example, 0 was a valid address,
or 0,0 was a valid range). Addresses of 0, or command
execution in an empty file, make sense only for commands
that add new text to the edit buffer or write commands
(because users may wish to write empty files).
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires this behavior for
such commands and disallows it otherwise, for consistency
and simplicity of specification.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A count to an
<i>ex</i> command has been historically corrected to be no
greater than the last line in a file; for example, in a
five-line file, the command <b>1,6print</b> would fail, but
the command <b>1print300</b> would succeed.
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires conformance to
historical practice.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Historically,
the use of flags in <i>ex</i> commands could be obscure.
General historical practice was as described by
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001, but there were some special
cases. For instance, the <b>list</b>, <b>number</b>, and
<b>print</b> commands ignored trailing address offsets; for
example, <b>3p&nbsp;+++#</b> would display line 3, and 3
would be the current line after the execution of the
command. The <b>open</b> and <b>visual</b> commands ignored
both the trailing offsets and the trailing flags. Also,
flags specified to the <b>open</b> and <b>visual</b>
commands interacted badly with the <b>list</b> edit option,
and setting and then unsetting it during the open/visual
session would cause <i>vi</i> to stop displaying lines in
the specified format. For consistency and simplicity of
specification, IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 does not
permit any of these exceptions to the general rule.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001
uses the word <i>copy</i> in several places when discussing
buffers. This is not intended to imply implementation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Historically,
<i>ex</i> users could not specify numeric buffers because of
the ambiguity this would cause; for example, in the command
<b>3&nbsp;delete&nbsp;2</b>, it is unclear whether 2 is a
buffer name or a <i>count</i>.
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires conformance to
historical practice by default, but does not preclude
extensions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Historically,
the contents of the unnamed buffer were frequently discarded
after commands that did not explicitly affect it; for
example, when using the <b>edit</b> command to switch files.
For consistency and simplicity of specification,
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 does not permit this
behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The <i>ex</i>
utility did not historically have access to the numeric
buffers, and, furthermore, deleting lines in <i>ex</i> did
not modify their contents. For example, if, after doing a
delete in <i>vi</i>, the user switched to <i>ex</i>, did
another delete, and then switched back to <i>vi</i>, the
contents of the numeric buffers would not have changed.
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires conformance to
historical practice. Numeric buffers are described in the
<i>ex</i> utility in order to confine the description of
buffers to a single location in
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
metacharacters that trigger shell expansion in <i>file</i>
arguments match historical practice, as does the method for
doing shell expansion. Implementations wishing to provide
users with the flexibility to alter the set of
metacharacters are encouraged to provide a <b>shellmeta</b>
string edit option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Historically,
<i>ex</i> commands executed from <i>vi</i> refreshed the
screen when it did not strictly need to do so; for example,
<b>:!date&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;/dev/null</b> does not require a
screen refresh because the output of the UNIX <i>date</i>
command requires only a single line of the screen.
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires that the screen be
refreshed if it has been overwritten, but makes no
requirements as to how an implementation should make that
determination. Implementations may prompt and refresh the
screen regardless.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Abbreviate</b>
<br>
Historical practice was that characters that were entered as
part of an abbreviation replacement were subject to
<b>map</b> expansions, the <b>showmatch</b> edit option,
further abbreviation expansions, and so on; that is, they
were logically pushed onto the terminal input queue, and
were not a simple replacement.
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires conformance to
historical practice. Historical practice was that whenever a
non-word character (that had not been escaped by a
&lt;control&gt;-V) was entered after a word character,
<i>vi</i> would check for abbreviations. The check was based
on the type of the character entered before the word
character of the word/non-word pair that triggered the
check. The word character of the word/non-word pair that
triggered the check and all characters entered before the
trigger pair that were of that type were included in the
check, with the exception of &lt;blank&gt;s, which always
delimited the abbreviation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This means
that, for the abbreviation to work, the <i>lhs</i> must end
with a word character, there can be no transitions from word
to non-word characters (or <i>vice versa</i>) other than
between the last and next-to-last characters in the
<i>lhs</i>, and there can be no &lt;blank&gt;s in the
<i>lhs</i>. In addition, because of the historical quoting
rules, it was impossible to enter a literal
&lt;control&gt;-V in the <i>lhs</i>.
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires conformance to
historical practice. Historical implementations did not
inform users when abbreviations that could never be used
were entered; implementations are strongly encouraged to do
so.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For example,
the following abbreviations will work:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>:ab (p
REPLACE <br>
:ab p REPLACE <br>
:ab ((p REPLACE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
abbreviations will not work:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>:ab (
REPLACE <br>
:ab (pp REPLACE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Historical
practice is that words on the <i>vi</i> colon command line
were subject to abbreviation expansion, including the
arguments to the <b>abbrev</b> (and more interestingly) the
<b>unabbrev</b> command. Because there are implementations
that do not do abbreviation expansion for the first argument
to those commands, this is permitted, but not required, by
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001. However, the following
sequence:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>:ab foo bar
<br>
:ab foo baz</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">resulted in the
addition of an abbreviation of <b>&quot;baz&quot;</b> for
the string <b>&quot;bar&quot;</b> in historical <i>ex</i>/
<i>vi</i>, and the sequence:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>:ab foo1 bar
<br>
:ab foo2 bar <br>
:unabbreviate foo2</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">deleted the
abbreviation <b>&quot;foo1&quot;</b>, not
<b>&quot;foo2&quot;</b> . These behaviors are not permitted
by IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 because they clearly
violate the expectations of the user.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It was
historical practice that &lt;control&gt;-V, not backslash,
characters be interpreted as escaping subsequent characters
in the <b>abbreviate</b> command.
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires conformance to
historical practice; however, it should be noted that an
abbreviation containing a &lt;blank&gt; will never work.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Append</b>
<br>
Historically, any text following a vertical-line command
separator after an <b>append</b>, <b>change</b>, or
<b>insert</b> command became part of the insert text. For
example, in the command:</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>:g/pattern/append|stuff1</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">a line
containing the text <b>&quot;stuff1&quot;</b> would be
appended to each line matching pattern. It was also
historically valid to enter:</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>:append|stuff1
<br>
stuff2 <br>
.</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">and the text on
the <i>ex</i> command line would be appended along with the
text inserted after it. There was an historical bug,
however, that the user had to enter two terminating lines
(the <b>&rsquo;.&rsquo;</b> lines) to terminate text input
mode in this case. IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires
conformance to historical practice, but disallows the
historical need for multiple terminating lines.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Change</b>
<br>
See the RATIONALE for the <b>append</b> command. Historical
practice for cursor positioning after the change command
when no text is input, is as described in
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001. However, one System V
implementation is known to have been modified such that the
cursor is positioned on the first address specified, and not
on the line before the first address.
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 disallows this modification
for consistency.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Historically,
the <b>change</b> command did not support buffer arguments,
although some implementations allow the specification of an
optional buffer. This behavior is neither required nor
disallowed by IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Change
Directory</b> <br>
A common extension in <i>ex</i> implementations is to use
the elements of a <b>cdpath</b> edit option as prefix
directories for <i>path</i> arguments to <b>chdir</b> that
are relative pathnames and that do not have
<b>&rsquo;.&rsquo;</b> or <b>&quot;..&quot;</b> as their
first component. Elements in the <b>cdpath</b> edit option
are colon-separated. The initial value of the <b>cdpath</b>
edit option is the value of the shell <i>CDPATH</i>
environment variable. This feature was not included in
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 because it does not exist in
any of the implementations considered historical
practice.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Copy</b>
<br>
Historical implementations of <i>ex</i> permitted copies to
lines inside of the specified range; for example,
<b>:2,5copy3</b> was a valid command.
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires conformance to
historical practice.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Delete</b>
<br>
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires support for the
historical parsing of a <b>delete</b> command followed by
flags, without any intervening &lt;blank&gt;s. For
example:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="9%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>1dp</b></p></td>
<td width="2%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">Deletes the first line and
prints the line that was second.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="9%">


<p><b>1delep</b></p></td>
<td width="2%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>As for <b>1dp</b>.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="9%">


<p><b>1d</b></p></td>
<td width="2%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>Deletes the first line, saving it in buffer
<i>p</i>.</p> </td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="9%">


<p><b>1d&nbsp;p1l</b></p></td>
<td width="2%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>(Pee-one-ell.) Deletes the first line, saving it in
buffer <i>p</i>, and listing the line that was second.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Edit</b>
<br>
Historically, any <i>ex</i> command could be entered as a
<b>+</b> <i>command</i> argument to the <b>edit</b> command,
although some (for example, <b>insert</b> and <b>append</b>)
were known to confuse historical implementations. For
consistency and simplicity of specification,
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires that any command be
supported as an argument to the <b>edit</b> command.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Historically,
the command argument was executed with the current line set
to the last line of the file, regardless of whether the
<b>edit</b> command was executed from visual mode or not.
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires conformance to
historical practice.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Historically,
the <b>+</b> <i>command</i> specified to the <b>edit</b> and
<b>next</b> commands was delimited by the first
&lt;blank&gt;, and there was no way to quote them. For
consistency, IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires that
the usual <i>ex</i> backslash quoting be provided.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Historically,
specifying the <b>+</b> <i>command</i> argument to the edit
command required a filename to be specified as well; for
example, <b>:edit&nbsp;+100</b> would always fail. For
consistency and simplicity of specification,
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 does not permit this usage to
fail for that reason.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Historically,
only the cursor position of the last file edited was
remembered by the editor. IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001
requires that this be supported; however, implementations
are permitted to remember and restore the cursor position
for any file previously edited.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>File</b>
<br>
Historical versions of the <i>ex</i> editor <b>file</b>
command displayed a current line and number of lines in the
edit buffer of 0 when the file was empty, while the
<i>vi</i> &lt;control&gt;-G command displayed a current line
and number of lines in the edit buffer of 1 in the same
situation. IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 does not permit
this discrepancy, instead requiring that a message be
displayed indicating that the file is empty.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Global</b>
<br>
The two-pass operation of the <b>global</b> and <b>v</b>
commands is not intended to imply implementation, only the
required result of the operation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The current
line and column are set as specified for the individual
<i>ex</i> commands. This requirement is cumulative; that is,
the current line and column must track across all the
commands executed by the <b>global</b> or <b>v</b>
commands.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Insert</b>
<br>
See the RATIONALE for the <b>append</b> command.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Historically,
<b>insert</b> could not be used with an address of zero;
that is, not when the edit buffer was empty.
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires that this command
behave consistently with the <b>append</b> command.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Join</b>
<br>
The action of the <b>join</b> command in relation to the
special characters is only defined for the POSIX locale
because the correct amount of white space after a period
varies; in Japanese none is required, in French only a
single space, and so on.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>List</b>
<br>
The historical output of the <b>list</b> command was
potentially ambiguous. The standard developers believed
correcting this to be more important than adhering to
historical practice, and IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001
requires unambiguous output.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Map</b> <br>
Historically, command mode maps only applied to command
names; for example, if the character <b>&rsquo;x&rsquo;</b>
was mapped to <b>&rsquo;y&rsquo;</b>, the command <b>fx</b>
searched for the <b>&rsquo;x&rsquo;</b> character, not the
<b>&rsquo;y&rsquo;</b> character.
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires this behavior.
Historically, entering &lt;control&gt;-V as the first
character of a <i>vi</i> command was an error. Several
implementations have extended the semantics of <i>vi</i>
such that &lt;control&gt;-V means that the subsequent
command character is not mapped. This is permitted, but not
required, by IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001. Regardless,
using &lt;control&gt;-V to escape the second or later
character in a sequence of characters that might match a
<b>map</b> command, or any character in text input mode, is
historical practice, and stops the entered keys from
matching a map. IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires
conformance to historical practice.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Historical
implementations permitted digits to be used as a <b>map</b>
command <i>lhs</i>, but then ignored the map.
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires that the mapped
digits not be ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The historical
implementation of the <b>map</b> command did not permit
<b>map</b> commands that were more than a single character
in length if the first character was printable. This
behavior is permitted, but not required, by
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Historically,
mapped characters were remapped unless the <b>remap</b> edit
option was not set, or the prefix of the mapped characters
matched the mapping characters; for example, in the
<b>map</b>:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>:map ab
abcd</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">the characters
<b>&quot;ab&quot;</b> were used as is and were not remapped,
but the characters <b>&quot;cd&quot;</b> were mapped if
appropriate. This can cause infinite loops in the <i>vi</i>
mapping mechanisms. IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires
conformance to historical practice, and that such loops be
interruptible.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Text input maps
had the same problems with expanding the <i>lhs</i> for the
<i>ex</i> <b>map!</b> and <b>unmap!</b> command as did the
<i>ex</i> <b>abbreviate</b> and <b>unabbreviate</b>
commands. See the RATIONALE for the <i>ex</i>
<b>abbreviate</b> command. IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001
requires similar modification of some historical practice
for the <b>map</b> and <b>unmap</b> commands, as described
for the <b>abbreviate</b> and <b>unabbreviate</b>
commands.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Historically,
<b>map</b>s that were subsets of other <b>map</b>s behaved
differently depending on the order in which they were
defined. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>:map! ab
short <br>
:map! abc long</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">would always
translate the characters <b>&quot;ab&quot;</b> to
<b>&quot;short&quot;</b>, regardless of how fast the
characters <b>&quot;abc&quot;</b> were entered. If the entry
order was reversed:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>:map! abc
long <br>
:map! ab short</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">the characters
<b>&quot;ab&quot;</b> would cause the editor to pause,
waiting for the completing <b>&rsquo;c&rsquo;</b> character,
and the characters might never be mapped to
<b>&quot;short&quot;</b> . For consistency and simplicity of
specification, IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires that
the shortest match be used at all times.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The length of
time the editor spends waiting for the characters to
complete the <i>lhs</i> is unspecified because the timing
capabilities of systems are often inexact and variable, and
it may depend on other factors such as the speed of the
connection. The time should be long enough for the user to
be able to complete the sequence, but not long enough for
the user to have to wait. Some implementations of <i>vi</i>
have added a <b>keytime</b> option, which permits users to
set the number of 0,1 seconds the editor waits for the
completing characters. Because mapped terminal function and
cursor keys tend to start with an &lt;ESC&gt; character, and
&lt;ESC&gt; is the key ending <i>vi</i> text input mode,
<b>map</b>s starting with &lt;ESC&gt; characters are
generally exempted from this timeout period, or, at least
timed out differently.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Mark</b>
<br>
Historically, users were able to set the &quot;previous
context&quot; marks explicitly. In addition, the <i>ex</i>
commands <b>&quot;</b> and <b>&rsquo;&lsquo;</b> and the
<i>vi</i> commands <b>&quot;</b>, <b>&lsquo;&lsquo;</b>,
<b>&lsquo;&rsquo;</b>, and <b>&rsquo;&lsquo;</b> all
referred to the same mark. In addition, the previous context
marks were not set if the command, with which the address
setting the mark was associated, failed.
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires conformance to
historical practice. Historically, if marked lines were
deleted, the mark was also deleted, but would reappear if
the change was undone. IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001
requires conformance to historical practice.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The description
of the special events that set the <b>&lsquo;</b> and
<b>&rsquo;</b> marks matches historical practice. For
example, historically the command <b>/a/,/b/</b> did not set
the <b>&lsquo;</b> and <b>&rsquo;</b> marks, but the command
<b>/a/,/b/delete</b> did.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Next</b>
<br>
Historically, any <i>ex</i> command could be entered as a
<b>+</b> <i>command</i> argument to the <b>next</b> command,
although some (for example, <b>insert</b> and <b>append</b>)
were known to confuse historical implementations.
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires that any command be
permitted and that it behave as specified. The <b>next</b>
command can accept more than one file, so usage such as:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>next
&lsquo;ls [abc] &lsquo;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">is valid; it
need not be valid for the <b>edit</b> or <b>read</b>
commands, for example, because they expect only one
filename.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Historically,
the <b>next</b> command behaved differently from the
<b>:rewind</b> command in that it ignored the force flag if
the <b>autowrite</b> flag was set. For consistency,
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 does not permit this
behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Historically,
the <b>next</b> command positioned the cursor as if the file
had never been edited before, regardless.
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 does not permit this
behavior, for consistency with the <b>edit</b> command.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Implementations
wanting to provide a counterpart to the <b>next</b> command
that edited the previous file have used the command
<b>prev[ious],</b> which takes no <i>file</i> argument.
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 does not require this
command.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Open</b>
<br>
Historically, the <b>open</b> command would fail if the
<b>open</b> edit option was not set.
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 does not mention the
<b>open</b> edit option and does not require this behavior.
Some historical implementations do not permit entering open
mode from open or visual mode, only from <i>ex</i> mode. For
consistency, IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 does not permit
this behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Historically,
entering open mode from the command line (that is, <i>vi</i>
<b>+open</b>) resulted in anomalous behaviors; for example,
the <i>ex</i> file and <i>set</i> commands, and the
<i>vi</i> command &lt;control&gt;-G did not work. For
consistency, IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 does not permit
this behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Historically,
the <b>open</b> command only permitted
<b>&rsquo;/&rsquo;</b> characters to be used as the search
pattern delimiter. For consistency,
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires that the search
delimiters used by the <b>s</b>, <b>global</b>, and <b>v</b>
commands be accepted as well.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Preserve</b>
<br>
The <b>preserve</b> command does not historically cause the
file to be considered unmodified for the purposes of future
commands that may exit the editor.
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires conformance to
historical practice.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Historical
documentation stated that mail was not sent to the user when
preserve was executed; however, historical implementations
did send mail in this case. IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001
requires conformance to the historical implementations.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Print</b>
<br>
The writing of NUL by the <b>print</b> command is not
specified as a special case because the standard developers
did not want to require <i>ex</i> to support NUL characters.
Historically, characters were displayed using the ARPA
standard mappings, which are as follows:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="12%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">1.</p></td>
<td width="2%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">Printable characters are left
alone.</p> </td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="12%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p>2.</p></td>
<td width="2%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>Control characters less than \177 are represented as
<b>&rsquo;^&rsquo;</b> followed by the character offset from
the <b>&rsquo;@&rsquo;</b> character in the ASCII map; for
example, \007 is represented as <b>&rsquo;^G&rsquo;</b>
.</p> </td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="12%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p>3.</p></td>
<td width="2%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>\177 is represented as <b>&rsquo;^&rsquo;</b> followed
by <b>&rsquo;?&rsquo;</b> .</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The display of
characters having their eighth bit set was less standard.
Existing implementations use hex (0x00), octal (\000), and a
meta-bit display. (The latter displayed bytes that had their
eighth bit set as the two characters <b>&quot;M-&quot;</b>
followed by the seven-bit display as described above.) The
latter probably has the best claim to historical practice
because it was used for the <b>-v</b> option of 4 BSD and 4
BSD-derived versions of the <i>cat</i> utility since
1980.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">No specific
display format is required by
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Explicit
dependence on the ASCII character set has been avoided where
possible, hence the use of the phrase an
&quot;implementation-defined multi-character sequence&quot;
for the display of non-printable characters in preference to
the historical usage of, for instance, <b>&quot;^I&quot;</b>
for the &lt;tab&gt;. Implementations are encouraged to
conform to historical practice in the absence of any strong
reason to diverge.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Historically,
all <i>ex</i> commands beginning with the letter
<b>&rsquo;p&rsquo;</b> could be entered using capitalized
versions of the commands; for example, <b>P[rint]</b>,
<b>Pre[serve]</b>, and <b>Pu[t]</b> were all valid command
names. IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 permits, but does not
require, this historical practice because capital forms of
the commands are used by some implementations for other
purposes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Put</b> <br>
Historically, an <i>ex</i> <b>put</b> command, executed from
open or visual mode, was the same as the open or visual mode
<b>P</b> command, if the buffer was named and was cut in
character mode, and the same as the <b>p</b> command if the
buffer was named and cut in line mode. If the unnamed buffer
was the source of the text, the entire line from which the
text was taken was usually <b>put</b>, and the buffer was
handled as if in line mode, but it was possible to get
extremely anomalous behavior. In addition, using the
<b>Q</b> command to switch into <i>ex</i> mode, and then
doing a <b>put</b> often resulted in errors as well, such as
appending text that was unrelated to the (supposed) contents
of the buffer. For consistency and simplicity of
specification, IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 does not
permit these behaviors. All <i>ex</i> <b>put</b> commands
are required to operate in line mode, and the contents of
the buffers are not altered by changing the mode of the
editor.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Read</b>
<br>
Historically, an <i>ex</i> <b>read</b> command executed from
open or visual mode, executed in an empty file, left an
empty line as the first line of the file. For consistency
and simplicity of specification,
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 does not permit this
behavior. Historically, a <b>read</b> in open or visual mode
from a program left the cursor at the last line read in, not
the first. For consistency, IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001
does not permit this behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Historical
implementations of <i>ex</i> were unable to undo <b>read</b>
commands that read from the output of a program. For
consistency, IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 does not permit
this behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Historically,
the <i>ex</i> and <i>vi</i> message after a successful
<b>read</b> or <b>write</b> command specified
&quot;characters&quot;, not &quot;bytes&quot;.
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires that the number of
bytes be displayed, not the number of characters, because it
may be difficult in multi-byte implementations to determine
the number of characters read. Implementations are
encouraged to clarify the message displayed to the user.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Historically,
reads were not permitted on files other than type regular,
except that FIFO files could be read (probably only because
they did not exist when <i>ex</i> and <i>vi</i> were
originally written). Because the historical <i>ex</i>
evaluated <b>read!</b> and <b>read&nbsp;!</b> equivalently,
there can be no optional way to force the read.
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 permits, but does not
require, this behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Recover</b>
<br>
Some historical implementations of the editor permitted
users to recover the edit buffer contents from a previous
edit session, and then exit without saving those contents
(or explicitly discarding them). The intent of
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 in requiring that the edit
buffer be treated as already modified is to prevent this
user error.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Rewind</b>
<br>
Historical implementations supported the <b>rewind</b>
command when the user was editing the first file in the
list; that is, the file that the <b>rewind</b> command would
edit. IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires conformance to
historical practice.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Substitute</b>
<br>
Historically, <i>ex</i> accepted an <b>r</b> option to the
<b>s</b> command. The effect of the <b>r</b> option was to
use the last regular expression used in any command as the
pattern, the same as the <b>~</b> command. The <b>r</b>
option is not required by IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001.
Historically, the <b>c</b> and <b>g</b> options were
toggled; for example, the command <b>:s/abc/def/</b> was the
same as <b>s/abc/def/ccccgggg</b>. For simplicity of
specification, IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 does not
permit this behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The tilde
command is often used to replace the last search RE. For
example, in the sequence:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>s/red/blue/
<br>
/green <br>
~</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">the <b>~</b>
command is equivalent to:</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>s/green/blue/</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Historically,
<i>ex</i> accepted all of the following forms:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>s/abc/def/
<br>
s/abc/def <br>
s/abc/ <br>
s/abc</b></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001
requires conformance to this historical practice.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The <b>s</b>
command presumes that the <b>&rsquo;^&rsquo;</b> character
only occupies a single column in the display. Much of the
<i>ex</i> and <i>vi</i> specification presumes that the
&lt;space&gt; only occupies a single column in the display.
There are no known character sets for which this is not
true.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Historically,
the final column position for the substitute commands was
based on previous column movements; a search for a pattern
followed by a substitution would leave the column position
unchanged, while a 0 command followed by a substitution
would change the column position to the first non-
&lt;blank&gt;. For consistency and simplicity of
specification, IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires that
the final column position always be set to the first non-
&lt;blank&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Set</b> <br>
Historical implementations redisplayed all of the options
for each occurrence of the <b>all</b> keyword.
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 permits, but does not
require, this behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Tag</b> <br>
No requirement is made as to where <i>ex</i> and <i>vi</i>
shall look for the file referenced by the tag entry.
Historical practice has been to look for the path found in
the <b>tags</b> file, based on the current directory. A
useful extension found in some implementations is to look
based on the directory containing the tags file that held
the entry, as well. No requirement is made as to which
reference for the tag in the tags file is used. This is
deliberate, in order to permit extensions such as multiple
entries in a tags file for a tag.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Because users
often specify many different tags files, some of which need
not be relevant or exist at any particular time,
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires that error messages
about problem tags files be displayed only if the requested
tag is not found, and then, only once for each time that the
<b>tag</b> edit option is changed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The requirement
that the current edit buffer be unmodified is only necessary
if the file indicated by the tag entry is not the same as
the current file (as defined by the current pathname).
Historically, the file would be reloaded if the filename had
changed, as well as if the filename was different from the
current pathname. For consistency and simplicity of
specification, IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 does not
permit this behavior, requiring that the name be the only
factor in the decision.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Historically,
<i>vi</i> only searched for tags in the current file from
the current cursor to the end of the file, and therefore, if
the <b>wrapscan</b> option was not set, tags occurring
before the current cursor were not found.
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 considers this a bug, and
implementations are required to search for the first
occurrence in the file, regardless.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Undo</b>
<br>
The <b>undo</b> description deliberately uses the word
&quot;modified&quot;. The <b>undo</b> command is not
intended to undo commands that replace the contents of the
edit buffer, such as <b>edit</b>, <b>next</b>, <b>tag</b>,
or <b>recover</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Cursor
positioning after the <b>undo</b> command was inconsistent
in the historical <i>vi</i>, sometimes attempting to restore
the original cursor position ( <b>global</b>, <b>undo</b>,
and <b>v</b> commands), and sometimes, in the presence of
maps, placing the cursor on the last line added or changed
instead of the first. IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001
requires a simplified behavior for consistency and
simplicity of specification.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Version</b>
<br>
The <b>version</b> command cannot be exactly specified since
there is no widely-accepted definition of what the version
information should contain. Implementations are encouraged
to do something reasonably intelligent.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Write</b>
<br>
Historically, the <i>ex</i> and <i>vi</i> message after a
successful <b>read</b> or <b>write</b> command specified
&quot;characters&quot;, not &quot;bytes&quot;.
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires that the number of
bytes be displayed, not the number of characters because it
may be difficult in multi-byte implementations to determine
the number of characters written. Implementations are
encouraged to clarify the message displayed to the user.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Implementation-defined
tests are permitted so that implementations can make
additional checks; for example, for locks or file
modification times.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Historically,
attempting to append to a nonexistent file caused an error.
It has been left unspecified in
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 to permit implementations to
let the <b>write</b> succeed, so that the append semantics
are similar to those of the historical <i>csh</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Historical
<i>vi</i> permitted empty edit buffers to be written.
However, since the way <i>vi</i> got around dealing with
&quot;empty&quot; files was to always have a line in the
edit buffer, no matter what, it wrote them as files of a
single, empty line. IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 does not
permit this behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Historically,
<i>ex</i> restored standard output and standard error to
their values as of when <i>ex</i> was invoked, before writes
to programs were performed. This could disturb the terminal
configuration as well as be a security issue for some
terminals. IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 does not permit
this, requiring that the program output be captured and
displayed as if by the <i>ex</i> <b>print</b> command.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Adjust
Window</b> <br>
Historically, the line count was set to the value of the
<b>scroll</b> option if the type character was end-of-file.
This feature was broken on most historical implementations
long ago, however, and is not documented anywhere. For this
reason, IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 is resolutely
silent.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Historically,
the <b>z</b> command was &lt;blank&gt;-sensitive and
<b>z&nbsp;+</b> and <b>z&nbsp;-</b> did different things
than <b>z+</b> and <b>z-</b> because the type could not be
distinguished from a flag. (The commands <b>z\fP. and
z&nbsp;= were historically invalid.)
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires conformance to this
historical practice.</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Historically,
the <b>z</b> command was further &lt;blank&gt;-sensitive in
that the <i>count</i> could not be &lt;blank&gt;-delimited;
for example, the commands <b>z=&nbsp;5</b> and
<b>z-&nbsp;5</b> were also invalid. Because the <i>count</i>
is not ambiguous with respect to either the type character
or the flags, this is not permitted by
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Escape</b>
<br>
Historically, <i>ex</i> filter commands only read the
standard output of the commands, letting standard error
appear on the terminal as usual. The <i>vi</i> utility,
however, read both standard output and standard error.
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires the latter behavior
for both <i>ex</i> and <i>vi</i>, for consistency.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Shift Left
and Shift Right</b> <br>
Historically, it was possible to add shift characters to
increase the effect of the command; for example,
<b>&lt;&lt;&lt;</b> outdented (or <b>&gt;&gt;&gt;</b>
indented) the lines 3 levels of indentation instead of the
default 1. IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires
conformance to historical practice.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&lt;control&gt;-D</b>
<br>
Historically, the &lt;control&gt;-D command erased the
prompt, providing the user with an unbroken presentation of
lines from the edit buffer. This is not required by
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001; implementations are
encouraged to provide it if possible. Historically, the
&lt;control&gt;-D command took, and then ignored, a
<i>count</i>. IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 does not permit
this behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Write Line
Number</b> <br>
Historically, the <i>ex</i> <b>=</b> command, when executed
in <i>ex</i> mode in an empty edit buffer, reported 0, and
from open or visual mode, reported 1. For consistency and
simplicity of specification, IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001
does not permit this behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Execute</b>
<br>
Historically, <i>ex</i> did not correctly handle the
inclusion of text input commands (that is, <b>append</b>,
<b>insert</b>, and <b>change</b>) in executed buffers.
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 does not permit this
exclusion for consistency.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Historically,
the logical contents of the buffer being executed did not
change if the buffer itself were modified by the commands
being executed; that is, buffer execution did not support
self-modifying code. IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires
conformance to historical practice.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Historically,
the <b>@</b> command took a range of lines, and the <b>@</b>
buffer was executed once per line, with the current line (
<b>&rsquo;.&rsquo;</b> ) set to each specified line.
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires conformance to
historical practice.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Some historical
implementations did not notice if errors occurred during
buffer execution. This, coupled with the ability to specify
a range of lines for the <i>ex</i> <b>@</b> command, makes
it trivial to cause them to drop <b>core</b>.
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires that implementations
stop buffer execution if any error occurs, if the specified
line doesn&rsquo;t exist, or if the contents of the edit
buffer itself are replaced (for example, the buffer executes
the <i>ex</i> <b>:edit</b> command).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Regular
Expressions in ex</b> <br>
Historical practice is that the characters in the
replacement part of the last <b>s</b> command-that is, those
matched by entering a <b>&rsquo;~&rsquo;</b> in the regular
expression-were not further expanded by the regular
expression engine. So, if the characters contained the
string <b>&quot;a.,&quot;</b> they would match
<b>&rsquo;a&rsquo;</b> followed by <b>&quot;.,&quot;</b> and
not <b>&rsquo;a&rsquo;</b> followed by any character.
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires conformance to
historical practice.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Edit Options
in ex</b> <br>
The following paragraphs describe the historical behavior of
some edit options that were not, for whatever reason,

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The <b>extended</b> edit option

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>hardtabs</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The <b>hardtabs</b> edit option
historically defined the number of columns between hardware
tab settings. This option was omitted from
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 because it was believed to no
longer be generally useful.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>modeline</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The <b>modeline</b> (sometimes
named <b>modelines</b>) edit option historically caused
<i>ex</i> or <i>vi</i> to read the five first and last lines
of the file for editor commands. This option is a security
problem, and vendors are strongly encouraged to delete it
from historical implementations.</p>

</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>optimize</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The <b>optimize</b> edit option
historically expedited text throughput by setting the
terminal to not do automatic &lt;carriage-return&gt;s when
printing more than one logical line of output. This option
was omitted from IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 because it
was intended for terminals without addressable cursors,
which are rarely, if ever, still used.</p>

historical practice.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>sourceany</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The <b>sourceany</b> edit
option historically caused <i>ex</i> or <i>vi</i> to source
start-up files that were owned by users other than the user
running the editor. This option is a security problem, and
vendors are strongly encouraged to remove it from their
implementations.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>timeout</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The <b>timeout</b> edit option
historically enabled the (now standard) feature of only
waiting for a short period before returning keys that could
be part of a macro. This feature was omitted from
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 because its behavior is now
standard, it is not widely useful, and it was rarely
documented.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>verbose</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The <b>verbose</b> edit option
has been used in some implementations of <i>vi</i> to cause
<i>vi</i> to output error messages for common errors; for
example, attempting to move the cursor past the beginning or
end of the line instead of only alerting the screen. (The
historical <i>vi</i> only alerted the terminal and presented
no message for such errors. The historical editor option
<b>terse</b> did not select when to present error messages,
it only made existing error messages more or less verbose.)
This option was omitted from IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001
because it is not widespread historical practice; however,
implementors are encouraged to use it if they wish to
provide error messages for naive users.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>wraplen</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The <b>wraplen</b> edit option
has been used in some implementations of <i>vi</i> to
specify an automatic margin measured from the left margin
instead of from the right margin. This is useful when
multiple screen sizes are being used to edit a single file.
This option was omitted from IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001
because it is not widespread historical practice; however,
implementors are encouraged to use it if they add this
functionality.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>autoindent,
ai</b> <br>
Historically, the command <b>0a</b> did not do any
autoindentation, regardless of the current indentation of
line 1. IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires that any
indentation present in line 1 be used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>autoprint,
ap</b> <br>
Historically, the <b>autoprint</b> edit option was not
completely consistent or based solely on modifications to
the edit buffer. Exceptions were the <b>read</b> command
(when reading from a file, but not from a filter), the
<b>append</b>, <b>change</b>, <b>insert</b>, <b>global</b>,
and <b>v</b> commands, all of which were not affected by
<b>autoprint</b>, and the <b>tag</b> command, which was
affected by <b>autoprint</b>. IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001
requires conformance to historical practice.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Historically,
the <b>autoprint</b> option only applied to the last of
multiple commands entered using vertical-bar delimiters; for
example, <b>delete</b> &lt;newline&gt; was affected by
<b>autoprint</b>, but <b>delete|version</b> &lt;newline&gt;
was not. IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires conformance
to historical practice.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>autowrite,
aw</b> <br>
Appending the <b>&rsquo;!&rsquo;</b> character to the
<i>ex</i> <b>next</b> command to avoid performing an
automatic write was not supported in historical
implementations. IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires
that the behavior match the other <i>ex</i> commands for
consistency.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>ignorecase,
ic</b> <br>
Historical implementations of case-insensitive matching (the
<b>ignorecase</b> edit option) lead to counterintuitive
situations when uppercase characters were used in range
expressions. Historically, the process was as follows:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="12%"></td>

<td width="12%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p>4.</p></td>
<td width="2%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>Match regular expressions against text.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This would mean
that, with <b>ignorecase</b> in effect, the text:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>The cat sat
on the mat</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">would be
matched by</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>/^the/</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">but not by:</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>/^[A-Z]he/</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For consistency
with other commands implementing regular expressions,
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 does not permit this
behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>paragraphs,
para</b> <br>
The ISO&nbsp;POSIX-2:1993 standard made the default
<b>paragraphs</b> and <b>sections</b> edit options
implementation-defined, arguing they were historically
oriented to the UNIX system <i>troff</i> text formatter, and
a &quot;portable user&quot; could use the <b>{</b>,
<b>}</b>, <b>[[</b>, <b>]]</b>, <b>(</b>, and <b>)</b>
commands in open or visual mode and have the cursor stop in
unexpected places. IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 specifies
their values in the POSIX locale because the unusual
grouping (they only work when grouped into two characters at
a time) means that they cannot be used for general-purpose
movement, regardless.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>readonly</b>
<br>
Implementations are encouraged to provide the best possible
information to the user as to the read-only status of the
file, with the exception that they should not consider the
current special privileges of the process. This provides
users with a safety net because they must force the
overwrite of read-only files, even when running with
additional privileges.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>readonly</b> edit option specification largely conforms
to historical practice. The only difference is that
historical implementations did not notice that the user had
set the <b>readonly</b> edit option in cases where the file
was already marked read-only for some reason, and would
therefore reinitialize the <b>readonly</b> edit option the
next time the contents of the edit buffer were replaced.
This behavior is disallowed by
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>report</b>
<br>
The requirement that lines copied to a buffer interact
differently than deleted lines is historical practice. For
example, if the <b>report</b> edit option is set to 3,
deleting 3 lines will cause a report to be written, but 4
lines must be copied before a report is written.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The requirement
that the <i>ex</i> <b>global</b>, <b>v</b>, <b>open</b>,
<b>undo</b>, and <b>visual</b> commands present reports
based on the total number of lines added or deleted during
the command execution, and that commands executed by the
<b>global</b> and <b>v</b> commands not present reports, is
historical practice. IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 extends
historical practice by requiring that buffer execution be
treated similarly. The reasons for this are two-fold.
Historically, only the report by the last command executed
from the buffer would be seen by the user, as each new
report would overwrite the last. In addition, the standard
developers believed that buffer execution had more in common
with <b>global</b> and <b>v</b> commands than it did with
other <i>ex</i> commands, and should behave similarly, for
consistency and simplicity of specification.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>showmatch,
sm</b> <br>
The length of time the cursor spends on the matching
character is unspecified because the timing capabilities of
systems are often inexact and variable. The time should be
long enough for the user to notice, but not long enough for
the user to become annoyed. Some implementations of
<i>vi</i> have added a <b>matchtime</b> option that permits
users to set the number of 0,1 second intervals the cursor
pauses on the matching character.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>showmode</b>
<br>
The <b>showmode</b> option has been used in some historical
implementations of <i>ex</i> and <i>vi</i> to display the
current editing mode when in open or visual mode. The
editing modes have generally included &quot;command&quot;
and &quot;input&quot;, and sometimes other modes such as
&quot;replace&quot; and &quot;change&quot;. The string was
usually displayed on the bottom line of the screen at the
far right-hand corner. In addition, a preceding
<b>&rsquo;*&rsquo;</b> character often denoted whether the
contents of the edit buffer had been modified. The latter
display has sometimes been part of the <b>showmode</b>
option, and sometimes based on another option. This option
was not available in the 4 BSD historical implementation of
<i>vi</i>, but was viewed as generally useful, particularly
to novice users, and is required by
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The <b>smd</b>
shorthand for the <b>showmode</b> option was not present in
all historical implementations of the editor.
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires it, for
consistency.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Not all
historical implementations of the editor displayed a mode
string for command mode, differentiating command mode from
text input mode by the absence of a mode string.
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 permits this behavior for
consistency with historical practice, but implementations
are encouraged to provide a display string for both
modes.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>slowopen</b>
<br>
Historically the <b>slowopen</b> option was automatically
set if the terminal baud rate was less than 1200 baud, or if
the baud rate was 1200 baud and the <b>redraw</b> option was
not set. The <b>slowopen</b> option had two effects. First,
when inserting characters in the middle of a line,
characters after the cursor would not be pushed ahead, but
would appear to be overwritten. Second, when creating a new
line of text, lines after the current line would not be
scrolled down, but would appear to be overwritten. In both
cases, ending text input mode would cause the screen to be
refreshed to match the actual contents of the edit buffer.
Finally, terminals that were sufficiently intelligent caused
the editor to ignore the <b>slowopen</b> option.
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 permits most historical
behavior, extending historical practice to require
<b>slowopen</b> behaviors if the edit option is set by the
user.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>tags</b>
<br>
The default path for tags files is left unspecified as
implementations may have their own <b>tags</b>
implementations that do not correspond to the historical
ones. The default <b>tags</b> option value should probably
at least include the file <b>./tags</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>term</b>
<br>
Historical implementations of <i>ex</i> and <i>vi</i>
ignored changes to the <b>term</b> edit option after the
initial terminal information was loaded. This is permitted
by IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001; however, implementations
are encouraged to permit the user to modify their terminal
type at any time.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>terse</b>
<br>
Historically, the <b>terse</b> edit option optionally
provided a shorter, less descriptive error message, for some
error messages. This is permitted, but not required, by
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001. Historically, most common
visual mode errors (for example, trying to move the cursor
past the end of a line) did not result in an error message,
but simply alerted the terminal. Implementations wishing to
provide messages for novice users are urged to do so based
on the <b>edit</b> option <b>verbose</b>, and not
<b>terse</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>window</b>
<br>
In historical implementations, the default for the
<b>window</b> edit option was based on the baud rate as
follows:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="12%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">1.</p></td>
<td width="2%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the baud rate was less than
1200, the <b>edit</b> option <b>w300</b> set the window
value; for example, the line:</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><b>set
w300=12</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">would set the
window option to 12 if the baud rate was less than 1200.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="12%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">2.</p></td>
<td width="2%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the baud rate was equal to
1200, the <b>edit</b> option <b>w1200</b> set the window
value.</p> </td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="12%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p>3.</p></td>
<td width="2%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>If the baud rate was greater than 1200, the <b>edit</b>
option <b>w9600</b> set the window value.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>w300</b>, <b>w1200</b>, and <b>w9600</b> options do not
appear in IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 because of their
dependence on specific baud rates.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In historical
implementations, the size of the window displayed by various
commands was related to, but not necessarily the same as,
the <b>window</b> edit option. For example, the size of the
window was set by the <i>ex</i> command <b>visual 10</b>,
but it did not change the value of the <b>window</b> edit
option. However, changing the value of the <b>window</b>
edit option did change the number of lines that were
displayed when the screen was repainted.
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 does not permit this behavior
in the interests of consistency and simplicity of
specification, and requires that all commands that change
the number of lines that are displayed do it by setting the
value of the <b>window</b> edit option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>wrapmargin,
wm</b> <br>
Historically, the <b>wrapmargin</b> option did not affect
maps inserting characters that also had associated
<i>count</i>s; for example
<b>:map&nbsp;K&nbsp;5aABC&nbsp;DEF</b>. Unfortunately, there
are widely used maps that depend on this behavior. For
consistency and simplicity of specification,
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 does not permit this
behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Historically,
<b>wrapmargin</b> was calculated using the column display
width of all characters on the screen. For example, an
implementation using <b>&quot;^I&quot;</b> to represent
&lt;tab&gt;s when the <b>list</b> edit option was set, where
<b>&rsquo;^&rsquo;</b> and <b>&rsquo;I&rsquo;</b> each took
up a single column on the screen, would calculate the
<b>wrapmargin</b> based on a value of 2 for each
&lt;tab&gt;. The <b>number</b> edit option similarly changed
the effective length of the line as well.
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires conformance to
historical practice.</p>
