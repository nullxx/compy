<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>dlopen</i>() function shall make an executable object
file specified by <i>file</i> available to the calling
program. The class of files eligible for this operation and
the manner of their construction are implementation-defined,
though typically such files are executable objects such as
shared libraries, relocatable files, or programs. Note that
some implementations permit the construction of dependencies
between such objects that are embedded within files. In such
cases, a <i>dlopen</i>() operation shall load such
dependencies in addition to the object referenced by
<i>file</i>. Implementations may also impose specific
constraints on the construction of programs that can employ
<i>dlopen</i>() and its related services.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A successful
<i>dlopen</i>() shall return a <i>handle</i> which the
caller may use on subsequent calls to <i>dlsym</i>() and
<i>dlclose</i>(). The value of this <i>handle</i> should not
be interpreted in any way by the caller.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The <i>file</i>
argument is used to construct a pathname to the object file.
If <i>file</i> contains a slash character, the <i>file</i>
argument is used as the pathname for the file. Otherwise,
<i>file</i> is used in an implementation-defined manner to
yield a pathname.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the value of
<i>file</i> is 0, <i>dlopen</i>() shall provide a
<i>handle</i> on a global symbol object. This object shall
provide access to the symbols from an ordered set of objects
consisting of the original program image file, together with
any objects loaded at program start-up as specified by that
process image file (for example, shared libraries), and the
set of objects loaded using a <i>dlopen</i>() operation
together with the RTLD_GLOBAL flag. As the latter set of
objects can change during execution, the set identified by
<i>handle</i> can also change dynamically.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Only a single
copy of an object file is brought into the address space,
even if <i>dlopen</i>() is invoked multiple times in
reference to the file, and even if different pathnames are
used to reference the file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The <i>mode</i>
parameter describes how <i>dlopen</i>() shall operate upon
<i>file</i> with respect to the processing of relocations
and the scope of visibility of the symbols provided within
<i>file</i>. When an object is brought into the address
space of a process, it may contain references to symbols
whose addresses are not known until the object is loaded.
These references shall be relocated before the symbols can
be accessed. The <i>mode</i> parameter governs when these
relocations take place and may have the following values:
<br>
RTLD_LAZY</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Relocations shall be performed
at an implementation-defined time, ranging from the time of
the <i>dlopen</i>() call until the first reference to a
given symbol occurs. Specifying RTLD_LAZY should improve
performance on implementations supporting dynamic symbol
binding as a process may not reference all of the functions
in any given object. And, for systems supporting dynamic
symbol resolution for normal process execution, this
behavior mimics the normal handling of process
execution.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">RTLD_NOW</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">All necessary relocations shall
be performed when the object is first loaded. This may waste
some processing if relocations are performed for functions
that are never referenced. This behavior may be useful for
applications that need to know as soon as an object is
loaded that all symbols referenced during execution are
available.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Any object
loaded by <i>dlopen</i>() that requires relocations against
global symbols can reference the symbols in the original
process image file, any objects loaded at program start-up,
from the object itself as well as any other object included
in the same <i>dlopen</i>() invocation, and any objects that
were loaded in any <i>dlopen</i>() invocation and which
specified the RTLD_GLOBAL flag. To determine the scope of
visibility for the symbols loaded with a <i>dlopen</i>()
invocation, the <i>mode</i> parameter should be a
bitwise-inclusive OR with one of the following values: <br>
RTLD_GLOBAL</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The object&rsquo;s symbols
shall be made available for the relocation processing of any
other object. In addition, symbol lookup using
<i>dlopen</i>(<i>0, mode</i>) and an associated
<i>dlsym</i>() allows objects loaded with this <i>mode</i>
to be searched.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">RTLD_LOCAL</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The object&rsquo;s symbols
shall not be made available for the relocation processing of
any other object.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If neither
RTLD_GLOBAL nor RTLD_LOCAL are specified, then an
implementation-defined default behavior shall be
applied.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If a
<i>file</i> is specified in multiple <i>dlopen</i>()
invocations, <i>mode</i> is interpreted at each invocation.
Note, however, that once RTLD_NOW has been specified all
relocations shall have been completed rendering further
RTLD_NOW operations redundant and any further RTLD_LAZY
operations irrelevant. Similarly, note that once RTLD_GLOBAL
has been specified the object shall maintain the RTLD_GLOBAL
status regardless of any previous or future specification of
RTLD_LOCAL, as long as the object remains in the address
space (see <i>dlclose</i>()).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Symbols
introduced into a program through calls to <i>dlopen</i>()
may be used in relocation activities. Symbols so introduced
may duplicate symbols already defined by the program or
previous <i>dlopen</i>() operations. To resolve the
ambiguities such a situation might present, the resolution
of a symbol reference to symbol definition is based on a
symbol resolution order. Two such resolution orders are
defined: <i>load</i> or <i>dependency</i> ordering. Load
order establishes an ordering among symbol definitions, such
that the definition first loaded (including definitions from
the image file and any dependent objects loaded with it) has
priority over objects added later (via <i>dlopen</i>()).
Load ordering is used in relocation processing. Dependency
ordering uses a breadth-first order starting with a given
object, then all of its dependencies, then any dependents of
those, iterating until all dependencies are satisfied. With
the exception of the global symbol object obtained via a
<i>dlopen</i>() operation on a <i>file</i> of 0, dependency
ordering is used by the <i>dlsym</i>() function. Load
ordering is used in <i>dlsym</i>() operations upon the
global symbol object.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When an object
is first made accessible via <i>dlopen</i>() it and its
dependent objects are added in dependency order. Once all
the objects are added, relocations are performed using load
order. Note that if an object or its dependencies had been
previously loaded, the load and dependency orders may yield
different resolutions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The symbols
introduced by <i>dlopen</i>() operations and available
through <i>dlsym</i>() are at a minimum those which are
exported as symbols of global scope by the object. Typically
such symbols shall be those that were specified in (for
example) C source code as having <i>extern</i> linkage. The
precise manner in which an implementation constructs the set
of exported symbols for a <i>dlopen</i>() object is
specified by that implementation.</p>

<h2>RETURN VALUE

cannot be found, cannot be opened for reading, is not of an
appropriate object format for processing by <i>dlopen</i>(),
or if an error occurs during the process of loading
<i>file</i> or relocating its symbolic references,
<i>dlopen</i>() shall return NULL. More detailed diagnostic
information shall be available through <i>dlerror</i>().</p>
