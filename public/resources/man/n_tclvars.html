Variables used by Tcl
_________________________________________________________________</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
global variables are created and managed automatically by
the Tcl library. Except where noted below, these variables
should normally be treated as read-only by
application-specific code and by users.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="4%">


<p><b>env</b></p></td>
<td width="7%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>This variable is maintained by Tcl as an array whose
elements are the environment variables for the process.
Reading an element will return the value of the
corresponding environment variable. Setting an element of
the array will modify the corresponding environment variable
or create a new one if it does not already exist. Unsetting
an element of <b>env</b> will remove the corresponding
environment variable. Changes to the <b>env</b> array will
affect the environment passed to children by commands like
<b>exec</b>. If the entire <b>env</b> array is unset then
Tcl will stop monitoring <b>env</b> accesses and will not
update environment variables.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Under Windows,
the environment variables PATH and COMSPEC in any
capitalization are converted automatically to upper case.
For instance, the PATH variable could be exported by the
operating system as &ldquo;path&rdquo;, &ldquo;Path&rdquo;,
&ldquo;PaTh&rdquo;, etc., causing otherwise simple Tcl code
to have to support many special cases. All other environment
variables inherited by Tcl are left unmodified. Setting an
env array variable to blank is the same as unsetting it as
this is the behavior of the underlying Windows OS. It should
be noted that relying on an existing and empty environment
variable will not work on Windows and is discouraged for
cross-platform usage.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The following
elements of <b>env</b> are special to Tcl: <b><br>
env(HOME)</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">This environment variable, if
set, gives the location of the directory considered to be
the current user&rsquo;s home directory, and to which a call
of <b>cd</b> without arguments or with just &ldquo;~&rdquo;
as an argument will change into. Most platforms set this
correctly by default; it does not normally need to be set by
user code.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>env(TCL_LIBRARY)</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">If set, then it specifies the
location of the directory containing library scripts (the
value of this variable will be assigned to the
<b>tcl_library</b> variable and therefore returned by the
command <b>info library</b>). If this variable is not set
then a default value is used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:32%; margin-top: 1em">Note that this
environment variable should <i>not</i> normally be set.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>env(TCLLIBPATH)</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">If set, then it must contain a
valid Tcl list giving directories to search during auto-load
operations. Directories must be specified in Tcl format,
using &ldquo;/&rdquo; as the path separator, regardless of
platform. This variable is only used when initializing the
<b>auto_path</b> variable.</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>env(TCL_INTERP_DEBUG_FRAME)</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">If existing, it has the same
effect as running <b>interp debug {} -frame 1</b> as the
very first command of each new Tcl interpreter.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>errorCode</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This variable holds the value
of the <b>&minus;errorcode</b> return option set by the most
recent error that occurred in this interpreter. This list
value represents additional information about the error in a
form that is easy to process with programs. The first
element of the list identifies a general class of errors,
and determines the format of the rest of the list. The
following formats for <b>&minus;errorcode</b> return options
are used by the Tcl core; individual applications may define
additional formats. <b><br>
ARITH</b> <i>code msg</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">This format is used when an
arithmetic error occurs (e.g. an attempt to divide zero by
zero in the <b>expr</b> command). <i>Code</i> identifies the
precise error and <i>msg</i> provides a human-readable
description of the error. <i>Code</i> will be either DIVZERO
(for an attempt to divide by zero), DOMAIN (if an argument
is outside the domain of a function, such as
acos(&minus;3)), IOVERFLOW (for integer overflow), OVERFLOW
(for a floating-point overflow), or UNKNOWN (if the cause of
the error cannot be determined).</p>

<p style="margin-left:32%; margin-top: 1em">Detection of
these errors depends in part on the underlying hardware and
system libraries.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>CHILDKILLED</b> <i>pid
sigName msg</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">This format is used when a
child process has been killed because of a signal. The
<i>pid</i> element will be the process&rsquo;s identifier
(in decimal). The <i>sigName</i> element will be the
symbolic name of the signal that caused the process to
terminate; it will be one of the names from the include file
signal.h, such as <b>SIGPIPE</b>. The <i>msg</i> element
will be a short human-readable message describing the
signal, such as &ldquo;write on pipe with no readers&rdquo;
for <b>SIGPIPE</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>CHILDSTATUS</b> <i>pid
code</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">This format is used when a
child process has exited with a non-zero exit status. The
<i>pid</i> element will be the process&rsquo;s identifier
(in decimal) and the <i>code</i> element will be the exit
code returned by the process (also in decimal).</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>CHILDSUSP</b> <i>pid sigName
msg</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">This format is used when a
child process has been suspended because of a signal. The
<i>pid</i> element will be the process&rsquo;s identifier,
in decimal. The <i>sigName</i> element will be the symbolic
name of the signal that caused the process to suspend; this
will be one of the names from the include file signal.h,
such as <b>SIGTTIN</b>. The <i>msg</i> element will be a
short human-readable message describing the signal, such as
&ldquo;background tty read&rdquo; for <b>SIGTTIN</b>.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="22%"></td>
<td width="6%">


<p><b>NONE</b></p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="68%">


<p>This format is used for errors where no additional
information is available for an error besides the message
returned with the error. In these cases the
<b>&minus;errorcode</b> return option will consist of a list
containing a single element whose contents are
<b>NONE</b>.</p> </td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>POSIX</b> <i>errName
msg</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">If the first element is
<b>POSIX</b>, then the error occurred during a POSIX kernel
call. The <i>errName</i> element will contain the symbolic
name of the error that occurred, such as <b>ENOENT</b>; this
will be one of the values defined in the include file
errno.h. The <i>msg</i> element will be a human-readable
message corresponding to <i>errName</i>, such as &ldquo;no
such file or directory&rdquo; for the <b>ENOENT</b>
case.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">To set the
<b>&minus;errorcode</b> return option, applications should
use library procedures such as <b>Tcl_SetObjErrorCode</b>,
<b>Tcl_SetReturnOptions</b>, and <b>Tcl_PosixError</b>, or
they may invoke the <b>&minus;errorcode</b> option of the
<b>return</b> command. If none of these methods for setting
the error code has been used, the Tcl interpreter will reset
the variable to <b>NONE</b> after the next error.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>errorInfo</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This variable holds the value
of the <b>&minus;errorinfo</b> return option set by the most
recent error that occurred in this interpreter. This string
value will contain one or more lines identifying the Tcl
commands and procedures that were being executed when the
most recent error occurred. Its contents take the form of a
stack trace showing the various nested Tcl commands that had
been invoked at the time of the error.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>tcl_library</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This variable holds the name of
a directory containing the system library of Tcl scripts,
such as those used for auto-loading. The value of this
variable is returned by the <b>info library</b> command. See
the <b>library</b> manual entry for details of the
facilities provided by the Tcl script library. Normally each
application or package will have its own
application-specific script library in addition to the Tcl
script library; each application should set a global
variable with a name like <b>$</b><i>app</i><b>_library</b>
(where <i>app</i> is the application&rsquo;s name) to hold
the network file name for that application&rsquo;s library
directory. The initial value of <b>tcl_library</b> is set
when an interpreter is created by searching several
different directories until one is found that contains an
appropriate Tcl startup script. If the <b>TCL_LIBRARY</b>
environment variable exists, then the directory it names is
checked first. If <b>TCL_LIBRARY</b> is not set or
doesn&rsquo;t refer to an appropriate directory, then Tcl
checks several other directories based on a compiled-in
default location, the location of the binary containing the
application, and the current working directory.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>tcl_patchLevel</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">When an interpreter is created
Tcl initializes this variable to hold a string giving the
current patch level for Tcl, such as <b>8.4.16</b> for Tcl
8.4 with the first sixteen official patches, or <b>8.5b3</b>
for the third beta release of Tcl 8.5. The value of this
variable is returned by the <b>info patchlevel</b>
command.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>tcl_pkgPath</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This variable holds a list of
directories indicating where packages are normally
installed. It is not used on Windows. It typically contains
either one or two entries; if it contains two entries, the
first is normally a directory for platform-dependent
packages (e.g., shared library binaries) and the second is
normally a directory for platform-independent packages
(e.g., script files). Typically a package is installed as a
subdirectory of one of the entries in <b>$tcl_pkgPath</b>.
The directories in <b>$tcl_pkgPath</b> are included by
default in the <b>auto_path</b> variable, so they and their
immediate subdirectories are automatically searched for
packages during <b>package require</b> commands. Note:
<b>tcl_pkgPath</b> is not intended to be modified by the
application. Its value is added to <b>auto_path</b> at
startup; changes to <b>tcl_pkgPath</b> are not reflected in
<b>auto_path</b>. If you want Tcl to search additional
directories for packages you should add the names of those
directories to <b>auto_path</b>, not <b>tcl_pkgPath</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>tcl_platform</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This is an associative array
whose elements contain information about the platform on
which the application is running, such as the name of the
operating system, its current release number, and the
machine&rsquo;s instruction set. The elements listed below
will always be defined, but they may have empty strings as
values if Tcl could not retrieve any relevant information.
In addition, extensions and applications may add additional
values to the array. The predefined elements are: <b><br>
byteOrder</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">The native byte order of this
machine: either <b>littleEndian</b> or <b>bigEndian</b>.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="22%"></td>
<td width="7%">


<p><b>debug</b></p></td>
<td width="3%"></td>
<td width="68%">


<p>If this variable exists, then the interpreter was
compiled with and linked to a debug-enabled C run-time. This
variable will only exist on Windows, so extension writers
can specify which package to load depending on the C
run-time library that is in use. This is not an indication
that this core contains symbols.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>machine</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">The instruction set executed by
this machine, such as <b>intel</b>, <b>PPC</b>, <b>68k</b>,
or <b>sun4m</b>. On UNIX machines, this is the value
returned by <b>uname -m</b>.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="22%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p><b>os</b></p></td>
<td width="7%"></td>
<td width="68%">


<p>The name of the operating system running on this
machine, such as <b>Windows 95</b>, <b>Windows NT</b>, or
<b>SunOS</b>. On UNIX machines, this is the value returned
by <b>uname -s</b>. On Windows 95 and Windows 98, the value
returned will be <b>Windows 95</b> to provide better
backwards compatibility to Windows 95; to distinguish
between the two, check the <b>osVersion</b>.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>osVersion</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">The version number for the
operating system running on this machine. On UNIX machines,
this is the value returned by <b>uname -r</b>. On Windows
95, the version will be 4.0; on Windows 98, the version will
be 4.10.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>platform</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Either <b>windows</b>, or
<b>unix</b>. This identifies the general operating
environment of the machine.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>threaded</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">If this variable exists, then
the interpreter was compiled with threads enabled.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="22%"></td>
<td width="6%">


<p><b>user</b></p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="68%">


<p>This identifies the current user based on the login
information available on the platform. This comes from the
USER or LOGNAME environment variable on Unix, and the value
from GetUserName on Windows.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>wordSize</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">This gives the size of the
native-machine word in bytes (strictly, it is same as the
result of evaluating <i>sizeof(long)</i> in C.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>pointerSize</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">This gives the size of the
native-machine pointer in bytes (strictly, it is same as the
result of evaluating <i>sizeof(void*)</i> in C.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>tcl_precision</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This variable controls the
number of digits to generate when converting floating-point
values to strings. It defaults to 0. <i>Applications should
not change this value;</i> it is provided for compatibility
with legacy code.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The default
value of 0 is special, meaning that Tcl should convert
numbers using as few digits as possible while still
distinguishing any floating point number from its nearest
neighbours. It differs from using an arbitrarily high value
for <i>tcl_precision</i> in that an inexact number like
<i>1.4</i> will convert as <i>1.4</i> rather than
<i>1.3999999999999999</i> even though the latter is nearer
to the exact value of the binary number.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If
<b>tcl_precision</b> is not zero, then when Tcl converts a
floating point number, it creates a decimal representation
of at most <b>tcl_precision</b> significant digits; the
result may be shorter if the shorter result represents the
original number exactly. If no result of at most
<b>tcl_precision</b> digits is an exact representation of
the original number, the one that is closest to the original
number is chosen. If the original number lies precisely
between two equally accurate decimal representations, then
the one with an even value for the least significant digit
is chosen; for instance, if <b>tcl_precision</b> is 3, then
0.3125 will convert to 0.312, not 0.313, while 0.6875 will
convert to 0.688, not 0.687. Any string of trailing zeroes
that remains is trimmed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">a
<b>tcl_precision</b> value of 17 digits is
&ldquo;perfect&rdquo; for IEEE floating-point in that it
allows double-precision values to be converted to strings
and back to binary with no loss of information. For this
reason, you will often see it as a value in legacy code that
must run on Tcl versions before 8.5. It is no longer
recommended; as noted above, a zero value is the preferred
method.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">All
interpreters in a thread share a single <b>tcl_precision</b>
value: changing it in one interpreter will affect all other
interpreters as well. Safe interpreters are not allowed to
modify the variable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Valid values
for <b>tcl_precision</b> range from 0 to 17.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>tcl_rcFileName</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This variable is used during
initialization to indicate the name of a user-specific
startup file. If it is set by application-specific
initialization, then the Tcl startup code will check for the
existence of this file and <b>source</b> it if it exists.
For example, for <b>wish</b> the variable is set to
<b>~/.wishrc</b> for Unix and <b>~/wishrc.tcl</b> for
Windows.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>tcl_traceCompile</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The value of this variable can
be set to control how much tracing information is displayed
during bytecode compilation. By default, tcl_traceCompile is
zero and no information is displayed. Setting
tcl_traceCompile to 1 generates a one-line summary in stdout
whenever a procedure or top-level command is compiled.
Setting it to 2 generates a detailed listing in stdout of
the bytecode instructions emitted during every compilation.
This variable is useful in tracking down suspected problems
with the Tcl compiler.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">This variable
and functionality only exist if <b>TCL_COMPILE_DEBUG</b> was
defined during Tcl&rsquo;s compilation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>tcl_traceExec</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The value of this variable can
be set to control how much tracing information is displayed
during bytecode execution. By default, tcl_traceExec is zero
and no information is displayed. Setting tcl_traceExec to 1
generates a one-line trace in stdout on each call to a Tcl
procedure. Setting it to 2 generates a line of output
whenever any Tcl command is invoked that contains the name
of the command and its arguments. Setting it to 3 produces a
detailed trace showing the result of executing each bytecode
instruction. Note that when tcl_traceExec is 2 or 3,
commands such as <b>set</b> and <b>incr</b> that have been
entirely replaced by a sequence of bytecode instructions are
not shown. Setting this variable is useful in tracking down
suspected problems with the bytecode compiler and
interpreter.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">This variable
and functionality only exist if <b>TCL_COMPILE_DEBUG</b> was
defined during Tcl&rsquo;s compilation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>tcl_wordchars</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The value of this variable is a
regular expression that can be set to control what are
considered &ldquo;word&rdquo; characters, for instances like
selecting a word by double-clicking in text in Tk. It is
platform dependent. On Windows, it defaults to <b>\S</b>,
meaning anything but a Unicode space character. Otherwise it
defaults to <b>\w</b>, which is any Unicode word character
(number, letter, or underscore).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>tcl_nonwordchars</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The value of this variable is a
regular expression that can be set to control what are
considered &ldquo;non-word&rdquo; characters, for instances
like selecting a word by double-clicking in text in Tk. It
is platform dependent. On Windows, it defaults to <b>\s</b>,
meaning any Unicode space character. Otherwise it defaults
to <b>\W</b>, which is anything but a Unicode word character
(number, letter, or underscore).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>tcl_version</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">When an interpreter is created
Tcl initializes this variable to hold the version number for
this version of Tcl in the form <i>x.y</i>. Changes to
<i>x</i> represent major changes with probable
incompatibilities and changes to <i>y</i> represent small
enhancements and bug fixes that retain backward
compatibility. The value of this variable is returned by the
<b>info tclversion</b> command.</p>
