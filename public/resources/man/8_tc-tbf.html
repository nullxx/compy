<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">burst is also
known as buffer and maxburst. mtu is also known as
minburst.</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The Token
Bucket Filter is a classless queueing discipline available
for traffic control with the <b>tc</b>(8) command.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">TBF is a pure
shaper and never schedules traffic. It is
non-work-conserving and may throttle itself, although
packets are available, to ensure that the configured rate is
not exceeded. It is able to shape up to 1mbit/s of normal
traffic with ideal minimal burstiness, sending out data
exactly at the configured rates.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Much higher
rates are possible but at the cost of losing the minimal
burstiness. In that case, data is on average dequeued at the
configured rate but may be sent much faster at millisecond
timescales. Because of further queues living in network
adaptors, this is often not a problem.</p>

<h2>ALGORITHM
<a name="ALGORITHM"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As the name
implies, traffic is filtered based on the expenditure of
<b>tokens.</b> Tokens roughly correspond to bytes, with the
additional constraint that each packet consumes some tokens,
no matter how small it is. This reflects the fact that even
a zero-sized packet occupies the link for some time.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On creation,
the TBF is stocked with tokens which correspond to the
amount of traffic that can be burst in one go. Tokens arrive
at a steady rate, until the bucket is full.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If no tokens
are available, packets are queued, up to a configured limit.
The TBF now calculates the token deficit, and throttles
until the first packet in the queue can be sent.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If it is not
acceptable to burst out packets at maximum speed, a peakrate
can be configured to limit the speed at which the bucket
empties. This peakrate is implemented as a second TBF with a
very small bucket, so that it doesn&rsquo;t burst.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To achieve
perfection, the second bucket may contain only a single
packet, which leads to the earlier mentioned 1mbit/s
limit.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This limit is
caused by the fact that the kernel can only throttle for at
minimum 1 &rsquo;jiffy&rsquo;, which depends on HZ as 1/HZ.
For perfect shaping, only a single packet can get sent per
jiffy - for HZ=100, this means 100 packets of on average
1000 bytes each, which roughly corresponds to 1mbit/s.</p>

<h2>PARAMETERS
<a name="PARAMETERS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">See
<b>tc</b>(8) for how to specify the units of these values.
<br>
limit or latency</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Limit is the number of bytes
that can be queued waiting for tokens to become available.
You can also specify this the other way around by setting
the latency parameter, which specifies the maximum amount of
time a packet can sit in the TBF. The latter calculation
takes into account the size of the bucket, the rate and
possibly the peakrate (if set). These two parameters are
mutually exclusive.</p>

<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="7%">


<p>burst</p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>Also known as buffer or maxburst. Size of the bucket, in
bytes. This is the maximum amount of bytes that tokens can
be available for instantaneously. In general, larger shaping
rates require a larger buffer. For 10mbit/s on Intel, you
need at least 10kbyte buffer if you want to reach your
configured rate!</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If your buffer
is too small, packets may be dropped because more tokens
arrive per timer tick than fit in your bucket. The minimum
buffer size can be calculated by dividing the rate by
HZ.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Token usage
calculations are performed using a table which by default
has a resolution of 8 packets. This resolution can be
changed by specifying the <b>cell</b> size with the burst.
For example, to specify a 6000 byte buffer with a 16 byte
cell size, set a burst of 6000/16. You will probably never
have to set this. Must be an integral power of 2.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A zero-sized packet does not use
zero bandwidth. For ethernet, no packet uses less than 64
bytes. The Minimum Packet Unit determines the minimal token
usage (specified in bytes) for a packet. Defaults to
zero.</p> </td></tr>

</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Furthermore, if
a peakrate is desired, the following parameters are
available: <br>
peakrate</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Maximum depletion rate of the
bucket. The peakrate does not need to be set, it is only
necessary if perfect millisecond timescale shaping is
required.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">mtu/minburst</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specifies the size of the
peakrate bucket. For perfect accuracy, should be set to the
MTU of the interface. If a peakrate is needed, but some
burstiness is acceptable, this size can be raised. A 3000
byte minburst allows around 3mbit/s of peakrate, given 1000
byte packets.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Like the
regular burstsize you can also specify a <b>cell</b>
size.</p>
