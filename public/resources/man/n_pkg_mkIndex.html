<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Pkg_mkIndex</b>
is a utility procedure that is part of the standard Tcl
library. It is used to create index files that allow
packages to be loaded automatically when <b>package
require</b> commands are executed. To use
<b>pkg_mkIndex</b>, follow these steps:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="4%">


<p>[1]</p></td>
<td width="7%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>Create the package(s). Each package may consist of one
or more Tcl script files or binary files. Binary files must
be suitable for loading with the <b>load</b> command with a
single argument; for example, if the file is <b>test.so</b>
it must be possible to load this file with the command
<b>load test.so</b>. Each script file must contain a
<b>package provide</b> command to declare the package and
version number, and each binary file must contain a call to
<b>Tcl_PkgProvide</b>.</p> </td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="4%">


<p>[2]</p></td>
<td width="7%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>Create the index by invoking <b>pkg_mkIndex</b>. The
<i>dir</i> argument gives the name of a directory and each
<i>pattern</i> argument is a <b>glob</b>-style pattern that
selects script or binary files in <i>dir</i>. The default
pattern is <b>*.tcl</b> and <b>*.[info
sharedlibextension]</b>.</p> </td></tr>
</table>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Pkg_mkIndex</b>
will create a file <b>pkgIndex.tcl</b> in <i>dir</i> with
package information about all the files given by the
<i>pattern</i> arguments. It does this by loading each file
into a slave interpreter and seeing what packages and new
commands appear (this is why it is essential to have
<b>package provide</b> commands or <b>Tcl_PkgProvide</b>
calls in the files, as described above). If you have a
package split among scripts and binary files, or if you have
dependencies among files, you may have to use the
<b>&minus;load</b> option or adjust the order in which
<b>pkg_mkIndex</b> processes the files. See <b>COMPLEX
CASES</b> below.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="4%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">[3]</p></td>
<td width="7%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">Install the package as a
subdirectory of one of the directories given by the
<b>tcl_pkgPath</b> variable. If <b>$tcl_pkgPath</b> contains
more than one directory, machine-dependent packages (e.g.,
those that contain binary shared libraries) should normally
be installed under the first directory and
machine-independent packages (e.g., those that contain only
Tcl scripts) should be installed under the second directory.
The subdirectory should include the package&rsquo;s script
and/or binary files as well as the <b>pkgIndex.tcl</b> file.
As long as the package is installed as a subdirectory of a
directory in <b>$tcl_pkgPath</b> it will automatically be
found during <b>package require</b> commands.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If you install
the package anywhere else, then you must ensure that the
directory containing the package is in the <b>auto_path</b>
global variable or an immediate subdirectory of one of the
directories in <b>auto_path</b>. <b>Auto_path</b> contains a
list of directories that are searched by both the
auto-loader and the package loader; by default it includes
<b>$tcl_pkgPath</b>. The package loader also checks all of
the subdirectories of the directories in <b>auto_path</b>.
You can add a directory to <b>auto_path</b> explicitly in
your application, or you can add the directory to your
<b>TCLLIBPATH</b> environment variable: if this environment
variable is present, Tcl initializes <b>auto_path</b> from
it during application startup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">[4]</p></td>
<td width="7%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once the above steps have been
taken, all you need to do to use a package is to invoke
<b>package require</b>. For example, if versions 2.1, 2.3,
and 3.1 of package <b>Test</b> have been indexed by
<b>pkg_mkIndex</b>, the command <b>package require Test</b>
will make version 3.1 available and the command <b>package
require &minus;exact Test 2.1</b> will make version 2.1
available. There may be many versions of a package in the
various index files in <b>auto_path</b>, but only one will
actually be loaded in a given interpreter, based on the
first call to <b>package require</b>. Different versions of
a package may be loaded in different interpreters.</p></td></tr>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The optional
switches are:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The generated index will

<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="18%">


<p><b>&minus;lazy</b></p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="66%">


<p>The generated index will manage to delay loading the
package until the use of one of the commands provided by the
package, instead of loading it immediately upon <b>package
require</b>. This is not compatible with the use of
<i>auto_reset</i>, and therefore its use is discouraged.</p></td></tr>

<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="18%">


<p><b>&minus;load</b> <i>pkgPat</i></p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="66%">


<p>The index process will pre-load any packages that exist
in the current interpreter and match <i>pkgPat</i> into the
slave interpreter used to generate the index. The pattern
match uses string match rules, but without making case
distinctions. See COMPLEX CASES below.</p></td></tr>

<h2>PACKAGES AND THE AUTO-LOADER
<a name="PACKAGES AND THE AUTO-LOADER"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The package
management facilities overlap somewhat with the auto-loader,
in that both arrange for files to be loaded on-demand.
However, package management is a higher-level mechanism that
uses the auto-loader for the last step in the loading
process. It is generally better to index a package with
<b>pkg_mkIndex</b> rather than <b>auto_mkindex</b> because
the package mechanism provides version control: several
versions of a package can be made available in the index
files, with different applications using different versions
based on <b>package require</b> commands. In contrast,
<b>auto_mkindex</b> does not understand versions so it can
only handle a single version of each package. It is probably
not a good idea to index a given package with both
<b>pkg_mkIndex</b> and <b>auto_mkindex</b>. If you use
<b>pkg_mkIndex</b> to index a package, its commands cannot
be invoked until <b>package require</b> has been used to
select a version; in contrast, packages indexed with
<b>auto_mkindex</b> can be used immediately since there is
no version control.</p>

<h2>HOW IT WORKS
<a name="HOW IT WORKS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Pkg_mkIndex</b>
depends on the <b>package unknown</b> command, the
<b>package ifneeded</b> command, and the auto-loader. The
first time a <b>package require</b> command is invoked, the
<b>package unknown</b> script is invoked. This is set by Tcl
initialization to a script that evaluates all of the
<b>pkgIndex.tcl</b> files in the <b>auto_path</b>. The
<b>pkgIndex.tcl</b> files contain <b>package ifneeded</b>
commands for each version of each available package; these
commands invoke <b>package provide</b> commands to announce
the availability of the package, and they setup auto-loader
information to load the files of the package. If the
<i>&minus;lazy</i> flag was provided when the
<b>pkgIndex.tcl</b> was generated, a given file of a given
version of a given package is not actually loaded until the
first time one of its commands is invoked. Thus, after
invoking <b>package require</b> you may not see the
package&rsquo;s commands in the interpreter, but you will be
able to invoke the commands and they will be
auto-loaded.</p>

<h2>DIRECT LOADING
<a name="DIRECT LOADING"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Some packages,
for instance packages which use namespaces and export
commands or those which require special initialization,
might select that their package files be loaded immediately
upon <b>package require</b> instead of delaying the actual
loading to the first use of one of the package&rsquo;s
command. This is the default mode when generating the
package index. It can be overridden by specifying the
<i>&minus;lazy</i> argument.</p>

<h2>COMPLEX CASES
<a name="COMPLEX CASES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Most complex
cases of dependencies among scripts and binary files, and
packages being split among scripts and binary files are
handled OK. However, you may have to adjust the order in
which files are processed by <b>pkg_mkIndex</b>. These
issues are described in detail below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If each script
or file contains one package, and packages are only
contained in one file, then things are easy. You simply
specify all files to be indexed in any order with some glob
patterns.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In general, it
is OK for scripts to have dependencies on other packages. If
scripts contain <b>package require</b> commands, these are
stubbed out in the interpreter used to process the scripts,
so these do not cause problems. If scripts call into other
packages in global code, these calls are handled by a stub
<b>unknown</b> command. However, if scripts make variable
references to other package&rsquo;s variables in global
code, these will cause errors. That is also bad coding
style.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If binary files
have dependencies on other packages, things can become
tricky because it is not possible to stub out C-level APIs
such as <b>Tcl_PkgRequire</b> API when loading a binary
file. For example, suppose the BLT package requires Tk, and
expresses this with a call to <b>Tcl_PkgRequire</b> in its
<b>Blt_Init</b> routine. To support this, you must run
<b>pkg_mkIndex</b> in an interpreter that has Tk loaded. You
can achieve this with the <b>&minus;load</b> <i>pkgPat</i>
option. If you specify this option, <b>pkg_mkIndex</b> will
load any packages listed by <b>info loaded</b> and that
match <i>pkgPat</i> into the interpreter used to process
files. In most cases this will satisfy the
<b>Tcl_PkgRequire</b> calls made by binary files.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you are
indexing two binary files and one depends on the other, you
should specify the one that has dependencies last. This way
the one without dependencies will get loaded and indexed,
and then the package it provides will be available when the
second file is processed. You may also need to load the
first package into the temporary interpreter used to create
the index by using the <b>&minus;load</b> flag; it will not
hurt to specify package patterns that are not yet
loaded.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you have a
package that is split across scripts and a binary file, then
you should avoid the <b>&minus;load</b> flag. The problem is
that if you load a package before computing the index it
masks any other files that provide part of the same package.
If you must use <b>&minus;load</b>, then you must specify
the scripts first; otherwise the package loaded from the
binary file may mask the package defined by the scripts.</p>
