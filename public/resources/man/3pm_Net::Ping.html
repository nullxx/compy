<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This module
contains methods to test the reachability of remote hosts on
a network. A ping object is first created with optional
parameters, a variable number of hosts may be pinged
multiple times and then the connection is closed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You may choose
one of six different protocols to use for the ping. The
&quot;tcp&quot; protocol is the default. Note that a live
remote host may still fail to be pingable by one or more of
these protocols. For example, www.microsoft.com is generally
alive but not &quot;icmp&quot; pingable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">With the
&quot;tcp&quot; protocol the <i>ping()</i> method attempts
to establish a connection to the remote host&rsquo;s echo
port. If the connection is successfully established, the
remote host is considered reachable. No data is actually
echoed. This protocol does not require any special
privileges but has higher overhead than the &quot;udp&quot;
and &quot;icmp&quot; protocols.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Specifying the
&quot;udp&quot; protocol causes the <i>ping()</i> method to
send a udp packet to the remote host&rsquo;s echo port. If
the echoed packet is received from the remote host and the
received packet contains the same data as the packet that
was sent, the remote host is considered reachable. This
protocol does not require any special privileges. It should
be borne in mind that, for a udp ping, a host will be
reported as unreachable if it is not running the appropriate
echo service. For Unix-like systems see <i>inetd</i>(8) for
more information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the
&quot;icmp&quot; protocol is specified, the <i>ping()</i>
method sends an icmp echo message to the remote host, which
is what the <small>UNIX</small> ping program does. If the
echoed message is received from the remote host and the
echoed information is correct, the remote host is considered
reachable. Specifying the &quot;icmp&quot; protocol requires
that the program be run as root or that the program be
setuid to root.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the
&quot;external&quot; protocol is specified, the
<i>ping()</i> method attempts to use the
<tt>&quot;Net::Ping::External&quot;</tt> module to ping the
remote host. <tt>&quot;Net::Ping::External&quot;</tt>
interfaces with your system&rsquo;s default
<tt>&quot;ping&quot;</tt> utility to perform the ping, and
generally produces relatively accurate results. If
<tt>&quot;Net::Ping::External&quot;</tt> if not installed on
your system, specifying the &quot;external&quot; protocol
will result in an error.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the
&quot;syn&quot; protocol is specified, the <i>ping()</i>
method will only send a <small>TCP SYN</small> packet to the
remote host then immediately return. If the syn packet was
sent successfully, it will return a true value, otherwise it
will return false. <small>NOTE:</small> Unlike the other
protocols, the return value does <small>NOT</small>
determine if the remote host is alive or not since the full
<small>TCP</small> three-way handshake may not have
completed yet. The remote host is only considered reachable
if it receives a <small>TCP ACK</small> within the timeout
specified. To begin waiting for the <small>ACK</small>
packets, use the <i>ack()</i> method as explained below. Use
the &quot;syn&quot; protocol instead the &quot;tcp&quot;
protocol to determine reachability of multiple destinations
simultaneously by sending parallel <small>TCP SYN</small>
packets. It will not block while testing each remote host.
demo/fping is provided in this distribution to demonstrate
the &quot;syn&quot; protocol as an example. This protocol
does not require any special privileges.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Functions</b>
<br>
Net::Ping&minus;&gt;new([$proto [, $def_timeout [, $bytes [,
$device [, $tos <br>
]]]]]);</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Create a new ping object. All
of the parameters are optional. <tt>$proto</tt> specifies
the protocol to use when doing a ping. The current choices
are &quot;tcp&quot;, &quot;udp&quot;, &quot;icmp&quot;,
&quot;stream&quot;, &quot;syn&quot;, or
&quot;external&quot;. The default is &quot;tcp&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If a default
timeout ($def_timeout) in seconds is provided, it is used
when a timeout is not given to the <i>ping()</i> method
(below). The timeout must be greater than 0 and the default,
if not specified, is 5 seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If the number
of data bytes ($bytes) is given, that many data bytes are
included in the ping packet sent to the remote host. The
number of data bytes is ignored if the protocol is
&quot;tcp&quot;. The minimum (and default) number of data
bytes is 1 if the protocol is &quot;udp&quot; and 0
otherwise. The maximum number of data bytes that can be
specified is 1024.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If
<tt>$device</tt> is given, this device is used to bind the
source endpoint before sending the ping packet. I believe
this only works with superuser privileges and with udp and
icmp protocols at this time.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If
<tt>$tos</tt> is given, this ToS is configured into the
socket.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">$p&minus;&gt;ping($host [,
$timeout]);</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Ping the remote host and wait
for a response. <tt>$host</tt> can be either the hostname or
the <small>IP</small> number of the remote host. The
optional timeout must be greater than 0 seconds and defaults
to whatever was specified when the ping object was created.
Returns a success flag. If the hostname cannot be found or
there is a problem with the <small>IP</small> number, the
success flag returned will be undef. Otherwise, the success
flag will be 1 if the host is reachable and 0 if it is not.
For most practical purposes, undef and 0 and can be treated
as the same case. In array context, the elapsed time as well
as the string form of the ip the host resolved to are also
returned. The elapsed time value will be a float, as
returned by the <i>Time::HiRes::time()</i> function, if
<i>hires()</i> has been previously called, otherwise it is
returned as an integer.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">$p&minus;&gt;source_verify( { 0
| 1 } );</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Allows source endpoint
verification to be enabled or disabled. This is useful for
those remote destinations with multiples interfaces where
the response may not originate from the same endpoint that
the original destination endpoint was sent to. This only
affects udp and icmp protocol pings.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This is enabled
by default.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">$p&minus;&gt;service_check( { 0
| 1 } );</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Set whether or not the connect
behavior should enforce remote service availability as well
as reachability. Normally, if the remote server reported
<small>ECONNREFUSED</small> , it must have been reachable
because of the status packet that it reported. With this
option enabled, the full three-way tcp handshake must have
been established successfully before it will claim it is
reachable. <small>NOTE:</small> It still does nothing more
than connect and disconnect. It does not speak any protocol
(i.e., <small>HTTP</small> or <small>FTP</small> ) to ensure
the remote server is sane in any way. The remote server
<small>CPU</small> could be grinding to a halt and
unresponsive to any clients connecting, but if the kernel
throws the <small>ACK</small> packet, it is considered alive
anyway. To really determine if the server is responding well
would be application specific and is beyond the scope of
Net::Ping. For udp protocol, enabling this option demands
that the remote server replies with the same udp data that
it was sent as defined by the udp echo service.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This affects
the &quot;udp&quot;, &quot;tcp&quot;, and &quot;syn&quot;
protocols.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This is
disabled by default.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;">$p&minus;&gt;tcp_service_check(
{ 0 | 1 } );</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Deprecated method, but does the
same as <i>service_check()</i> method.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">$p&minus;&gt;hires( { 0 | 1 }
);</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Causes this module to use
Time::HiRes module, allowing milliseconds to be returned by
subsequent calls to <i>ping()</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This is
disabled by default.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;">$p&minus;&gt;bind($local_addr);</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Sets the source address from
which pings will be sent. This must be the address of one of
the interfaces on the local host. <tt>$local_addr</tt> may
be specified as a hostname or as a text <small>IP</small>
address such as &quot;192.168.1.1&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If the protocol
is set to &quot;tcp&quot;, this method may be called any
number of times, and each call to the <i>ping()</i> method
(below) will use the most recent <tt>$local_addr</tt>. If
the protocol is &quot;icmp&quot; or &quot;udp&quot;, then
<i>bind()</i> must be called at most once per object, and
(if it is called at all) must be called before the first
call to <i>ping()</i> for that object.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">$p&minus;&gt;open($host);</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When you are using the
&quot;stream&quot; protocol, this call pre-opens the tcp
socket. It&rsquo;s only necessary to do this if you want to
provide a different timeout when creating the connection, or
remove the overhead of establishing the connection from the
first ping. If you don&rsquo;t call
<tt>&quot;open()&quot;</tt>, the connection is automatically
opened the first time <tt>&quot;ping()&quot;</tt> is called.
This call simply does nothing if you are using any protocol
other than stream.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">$p&minus;&gt;ack( [ $host ]
);</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When using the &quot;syn&quot;
protocol, use this method to determine the reachability of
the remote host. This method is meant to be called up to as
many times as <i>ping()</i> was called. Each call returns
the host (as passed to <i>ping()</i>) that came back with
the <small>TCP ACK</small> . The order in which the hosts
are returned may not necessarily be the same order in which
they were <small>SYN</small> queued using the <i>ping()</i>
method. If the timeout is reached before the <small>TCP
ACK</small> is received, or if the remote host is not
listening on the port attempted, then the <small>TCP</small>
connection will not be established and <i>ack()</i> will
return undef. In list context, the host, the ack time, and
the dotted ip string will be returned instead of just the
host. If the optional <tt>$host</tt> argument is specified,
the return value will be pertaining to that host only. This
call simply does nothing if you are using any protocol other
than syn.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">$p&minus;&gt;nack(
$failed_ack_host );</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The reason that host
<tt>$failed_ack_host</tt> did not receive a valid
<small>ACK</small> . Useful to find out why when ack(
<tt>$fail_ack_host</tt> ) returns a false value.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;">$p&minus;&gt;<i>close()</i>;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Close the network connection
for this ping object. The network connection is also closed
by &quot;undef <tt>$p</tt>&quot;. The network connection is
automatically closed if the ping object goes out of scope
(e.g. <tt>$p</tt> is local to a subroutine and you leave the
subroutine).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;">$p&minus;&gt;port_number([$port_number])</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When called with a port number,
the port number used to ping is set to <tt>$port_number</tt>
rather than using the echo port. It also has the effect of
calling <tt>&quot;$p&minus;&gt;service_check(1)&quot;</tt>
causing a ping to return a successful response only if that
specific port is accessible. This function returns the value
of the port that <tt>&quot;ping()&quot;</tt> will connect
to.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">pingecho($host [,
$timeout]);</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">To provide backward
compatibility with the previous version of Net::Ping, a
<i>pingecho()</i> subroutine is available with the same
functionality as before. <i>pingecho()</i> uses the tcp
protocol. The return values and parameters are the same as
described for the <i>ping()</i> method. This subroutine is
obsolete and may be removed in a future version of
Net::Ping.</p>

<h2>NOTES
<a name="NOTES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There will be
less network overhead (and some efficiency in your program)
if you specify either the udp or the icmp protocol. The tcp
protocol will generate 2.5 times or more traffic for each
ping than either udp or icmp. If many hosts are pinged
frequently, you may wish to implement a small wait (e.g.
25ms or more) between each ping to avoid flooding your
network with packets.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The icmp
protocol requires that the program be run as root or that it
be setuid to root. The other protocols do not require
special privileges, but not all network devices implement
tcp or udp echo.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Local hosts
should normally respond to pings within milliseconds.
However, on a very congested network it may take up to 3
seconds or longer to receive an echo packet from the remote
host. If the timeout is set too low under these conditions,
it will appear that the remote host is not reachable (which
is almost the truth).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Reachability
doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean that the remote host is
actually functioning beyond its ability to echo packets. tcp
is slightly better at indicating the health of a system than
icmp because it uses more of the networking stack to
respond.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Because of a
lack of anything better, this module uses its own routines
to pack and unpack <small>ICMP</small> packets. It would be
better for a separate module to be written which understands
all of the different kinds of <small>ICMP</small>
packets.</p>
