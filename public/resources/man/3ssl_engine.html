<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These functions
create, manipulate, and use cryptographic modules in the
form of <b><small>ENGINE</small></b> objects. These objects
act as containers for implementations of cryptographic
algorithms, and support a reference-counted mechanism to
allow them to be dynamically loaded in and out of the
running application.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
cryptographic functionality that can be provided by an
<b><small>ENGINE</small></b> implementation includes the
following abstractions;</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"> RSA_METHOD &minus; for providing alternative RSA implementations
 DSA_METHOD, DH_METHOD, RAND_METHOD, ECDH_METHOD, ECDSA_METHOD,
       STORE_METHOD &minus; similarly for other OpenSSL APIs
 EVP_CIPHER &minus; potentially multiple cipher algorithms (indexed by 'nid')
 EVP_DIGEST &minus; potentially multiple hash algorithms (indexed by 'nid')
 key&minus;loading &minus; loading public and/or private EVP_PKEY keys</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Reference
counting and handles</b> <br>
Due to the modular nature of the <small>ENGINE API,</small>
pointers to ENGINEs need to be treated as handles &minus;
ie. not only as pointers, but also as references to the
underlying <small>ENGINE</small> object. Ie. one should
obtain a new reference when making copies of an
<small>ENGINE</small> pointer if the copies will be used
(and released) independently.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><small>ENGINE</small>
objects have two levels of reference-counting to match the
way in which the objects are used. At the most basic level,
each <small>ENGINE</small> pointer is inherently a
<b>structural</b> reference &minus; a structural reference
is required to use the pointer value at all, as this kind of
reference is a guarantee that the structure can not be
deallocated until the reference is released.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">However, a
structural reference provides no guarantee that the
<small>ENGINE</small> is initiliased and able to use any of
its cryptographic implementations. Indeed it&rsquo;s quite
possible that most ENGINEs will not initialise at all in
typical environments, as ENGINEs are typically used to
support specialised hardware. To use an
<small>ENGINE</small> &rsquo;s functionality, you need a
<b>functional</b> reference. This kind of reference can be
considered a specialised form of structural reference,
because each functional reference implicitly contains a
structural reference as well &minus; however to avoid
difficult-to-find programming bugs, it is recommended to
treat the two kinds of reference independently. If you have
a functional reference to an <small>ENGINE,</small> you have
a guarantee that the <small>ENGINE</small> has been
initialised ready to perform cryptographic operations and
will remain uninitialised until after you have released your
reference.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Structural
references</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This basic type
of reference is used for instantiating new ENGINEs,
iterating across OpenSSL&rsquo;s internal linked-list of
loaded ENGINEs, reading information about an
<small>ENGINE,</small> etc. Essentially a structural
reference is sufficient if you only need to query or
manipulate the data of an <small>ENGINE</small>
implementation rather than use its functionality.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>ENGINE_new()</i> function returns a structural reference
to a new (empty) <small>ENGINE</small> object. There are
other <small>ENGINE API</small> functions that return
structural references such as; <i>ENGINE_by_id()</i>,
<i>ENGINE_get_first()</i>, <i>ENGINE_get_last()</i>,
<i>ENGINE_get_next()</i>, <i>ENGINE_get_prev()</i>. All
structural references should be released by a corresponding
to call to the <i>ENGINE_free()</i> function &minus; the
<small>ENGINE</small> object itself will only actually be
cleaned up and deallocated when the last structural
reference is released.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It should also
be noted that many <small>ENGINE API</small> function calls
that accept a structural reference will internally obtain
another reference &minus; typically this happens whenever
the supplied <small>ENGINE</small> will be needed by OpenSSL
after the function has returned. Eg. the function to add a
new <small>ENGINE</small> to OpenSSL&rsquo;s internal list
is <i>ENGINE_add()</i> &minus; if this function returns
success, then OpenSSL will have stored a new structural
reference internally so the caller is still responsible for
freeing their own reference with <i>ENGINE_free()</i> when
they are finished with it. In a similar way, some functions
will automatically release the structural reference passed
to it if part of the function&rsquo;s job is to do so. Eg.
the <i>ENGINE_get_next()</i> and <i>ENGINE_get_prev()</i>
functions are used for iterating across the internal
<small>ENGINE</small> list &minus; they will return a new
structural reference to the next (or previous)
<small>ENGINE</small> in the list or <small>NULL</small> if
at the end (or beginning) of the list, but in either case
the structural reference passed to the function is released
on behalf of the caller.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To clarify a
particular function&rsquo;s handling of references, one
should always consult that function&rsquo;s documentation
&quot;man&quot; page, or failing that the openssl/engine.h
header file includes some hints.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Functional
references</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As mentioned,
functional references exist when the cryptographic
functionality of an <small>ENGINE</small> is required to be
available. A functional reference can be obtained in one of
two ways; from an existing structural reference to the
required <small>ENGINE,</small> or by asking OpenSSL for the
default operational <small>ENGINE</small> for a given
cryptographic purpose.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To obtain a
functional reference from an existing structural reference,
call the <i>ENGINE_init()</i> function. This returns zero if
the <small>ENGINE</small> was not already operational and
couldn&rsquo;t be successfully initialised (eg. lack of
system drivers, no special hardware attached, etc),
otherwise it will return non-zero to indicate that the
<small>ENGINE</small> is now operational and will have
allocated a new <b>functional</b> reference to the
<small>ENGINE.</small> All functional references are
released by calling <i>ENGINE_finish()</i> (which removes
the implicit structural reference as well).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The second way
to get a functional reference is by asking OpenSSL for a
default implementation for a given task, eg. by
<i>ENGINE_get_default_RSA()</i>,
<i>ENGINE_get_default_cipher_engine()</i>, etc. These are
discussed in the next section, though they are not usually
required by application programmers as they are used
automatically when creating and using the relevant
algorithm-specific types in OpenSSL, such as <small>RSA,
DSA, EVP_CIPHER_CTX,</small> etc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Default
implementations</b> <br>
For each supported abstraction, the <small>ENGINE</small>
code maintains an internal table of state to control which
implementations are available for a given abstraction and
which should be used by default. These implementations are
registered in the tables and indexed by an &rsquo;nid&rsquo;
value, because abstractions like <small>EVP_CIPHER</small>
and <small>EVP_DIGEST</small> support many distinct
algorithms and modes, and ENGINEs can support arbitrarily
many of them. In the case of other abstractions like
<small>RSA, DSA,</small> etc, there is only one
&quot;algorithm&quot; so all implementations implicitly
register using the same &rsquo;nid&rsquo; index.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When a default
<small>ENGINE</small> is requested for a given
abstraction/algorithm/mode, (eg. when calling
RSA_new_method( <small>NULL</small> )), a
&quot;get_default&quot; call will be made to the
<small>ENGINE</small> subsystem to process the corresponding
state table and return a functional reference to an
initialised <small>ENGINE</small> whose implementation
should be used. If no <small>ENGINE</small> should (or can)
be used, it will return <small>NULL</small> and the caller
will operate with a <small>NULL ENGINE</small> handle
&minus; this usually equates to using the conventional
software implementation. In the latter case, OpenSSL will
from then on behave the way it used to before the
<small>ENGINE API</small> existed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Each state
table has a flag to note whether it has processed this
&quot;get_default&quot; query since the table was last
modified, because to process this question it must iterate
across all the registered ENGINEs in the table trying to
initialise each of them in turn, in case one of them is
operational. If it returns a functional reference to an
<small>ENGINE,</small> it will also cache another reference
to speed up processing future queries (without needing to
iterate across the table). Likewise, it will cache a
<small>NULL</small> response if no <small>ENGINE</small> was
available so that future queries won&rsquo;t repeat the same
iteration unless the state table changes. This behaviour can
also be changed; if the
<small>ENGINE_TABLE_FLAG_NOINIT</small> flag is set (using
<i>ENGINE_set_table_flags()</i>), no attempted
initialisations will take place, instead the only way for
the state table to return a non-NULL <small>ENGINE</small>
to the &quot;get_default&quot; query will be if one is
expressly set in the table. Eg.
<i>ENGINE_set_default_RSA()</i> does the same job as
<i>ENGINE_register_RSA()</i> except that it also sets the
state table&rsquo;s cached response for the
&quot;get_default&quot; query. In the case of abstractions
like <small>EVP_CIPHER,</small> where implementations are
indexed by &rsquo;nid&rsquo;, these flags and
cached-responses are distinct for each &rsquo;nid&rsquo;
value.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Application
requirements</b> <br>
This section will explain the basic things an application
programmer should support to make the most useful elements
of the <small>ENGINE</small> functionality available to the
user. The first thing to consider is whether the programmer
wishes to make alternative <small>ENGINE</small> modules
available to the application and user. OpenSSL maintains an
internal linked list of &quot;visible&quot; ENGINEs from
which it has to operate &minus; at start-up, this list is
empty and in fact if an application does not call any
<small>ENGINE API</small> calls and it uses static linking
against openssl, then the resulting application binary will
not contain any alternative <small>ENGINE</small> code at
all. So the first consideration is whether any/all available
<small>ENGINE</small> implementations should be made visible
to OpenSSL &minus; this is controlled by calling the various
&quot;load&quot; functions, eg.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"> /* Make the &quot;dynamic&quot; ENGINE available */
 void ENGINE_load_dynamic(void);
 /* Make the CryptoSwift hardware acceleration support available */
 void ENGINE_load_cswift(void);
 /* Make support for nCipher's &quot;CHIL&quot; hardware available */
 void ENGINE_load_chil(void);
 ...
 /* Make ALL ENGINE implementations bundled with OpenSSL available */
 void ENGINE_load_builtin_engines(void);</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Having called
any of these functions, <small>ENGINE</small> objects would
have been dynamically allocated and populated with these
implementations and linked into OpenSSL&rsquo;s internal
linked list. At this point it is important to mention an
important <small>API</small> function;</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"> void ENGINE_cleanup(void);</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If no
<small>ENGINE API</small> functions are called at all in an
application, then there are no inherent memory leaks to
worry about from the <small>ENGINE</small> functionality,
however if any ENGINEs are loaded, even if they are never
registered or used, it is necessary to use the
<i>ENGINE_cleanup()</i> function to correspondingly cleanup
before program exit, if the caller wishes to avoid memory
leaks. This mechanism uses an internal callback registration
table so that any <small>ENGINE API</small> functionality
that knows it requires cleanup can register its cleanup
details to be called during <i>ENGINE_cleanup()</i>. This
approach allows <i>ENGINE_cleanup()</i> to clean up after
any <small>ENGINE</small> functionality at all that your
program uses, yet doesn&rsquo;t automatically create linker
dependencies to all possible <small>ENGINE</small>
functionality &minus; only the cleanup callbacks required by
the functionality you do use will be required by the
linker.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The fact that
ENGINEs are made visible to OpenSSL (and thus are linked
into the program and loaded into memory at run-time) does
not mean they are &quot;registered&quot; or called into use
by OpenSSL automatically &minus; that behaviour is something
for the application to control. Some applications will want
to allow the user to specify exactly which
<small>ENGINE</small> they want used if any is to be used at
all. Others may prefer to load all support and have OpenSSL
automatically use at run-time any <small>ENGINE</small> that
is able to successfully initialise &minus; ie. to assume
that this corresponds to acceleration hardware attached to
the machine or some such thing. There are probably numerous
other ways in which applications may prefer to handle
things, so we will simply illustrate the consequences as
they apply to a couple of simple cases and leave developers
to consider these and the source code to openssl&rsquo;s
builtin utilities as guides.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Using a
specific <small>ENGINE</small> implementation</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Here
we&rsquo;ll assume an application has been configured by its
user or admin to want to use the &quot; <small>ACME&quot;
ENGINE</small> if it is available in the version of OpenSSL
the application was compiled with. If it is available, it
should be used by default for all <small>RSA, DSA,</small>
and symmetric cipher operation, otherwise OpenSSL should use
its builtin software as per usual. The following code
illustrates how to approach this;</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"> ENGINE *e;
 const char *engine_id = &quot;ACME&quot;;
 ENGINE_load_builtin_engines();
 e = ENGINE_by_id(engine_id);
 if(!e)
     /* the engine isn't available */
     return;
 if(!ENGINE_init(e)) {
     /* the engine couldn't initialise, release 'e' */
     ENGINE_free(e);
     return;
 }
 if(!ENGINE_set_default_RSA(e))
     /* This should only happen when 'e' can't initialise, but the previous
      * statement suggests it did. */
     abort();
 ENGINE_set_default_DSA(e);
 ENGINE_set_default_ciphers(e);
 /* Release the functional reference from ENGINE_init() */
 ENGINE_finish(e);
 /* Release the structural reference from ENGINE_by_id() */
 ENGINE_free(e);</pre>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Automatically
using builtin <small>ENGINE</small> implementations</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Here
we&rsquo;ll assume we want to load and register all
<small>ENGINE</small> implementations bundled with OpenSSL,
such that for any cryptographic algorithm required by
OpenSSL &minus; if there is an <small>ENGINE</small> that
implements it and can be initialise, it should be used. The
following code illustrates how this can work;</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"> /* Load all bundled ENGINEs into memory and make them visible */
 ENGINE_load_builtin_engines();
 /* Register all of them for every algorithm they collectively implement */
 ENGINE_register_all_complete();</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">That&rsquo;s
all that&rsquo;s required. Eg. the next time OpenSSL tries
to set up an <small>RSA</small> key, any bundled ENGINEs
that implement <small>RSA_METHOD</small> will be passed to
<i>ENGINE_init()</i> and if any of those succeed, that
<small>ENGINE</small> will be set as the default for
<small>RSA</small> use from then on.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Advanced
configuration support</b> <br>
There is a mechanism supported by the <small>ENGINE</small>
framework that allows each <small>ENGINE</small>
implementation to define an arbitrary set of configuration
&quot;commands&quot; and expose them to OpenSSL and any
applications based on OpenSSL. This mechanism is entirely
based on the use of name-value pairs and assumes
<small>ASCII</small> input (no unicode or <small>UTF</small>
for now!), so it is ideal if applications want to provide a
transparent way for users to provide arbitrary configuration
&quot;directives&quot; directly to such ENGINEs. It is also
possible for the application to dynamically interrogate the
loaded <small>ENGINE</small> implementations for the names,
descriptions, and input flags of their available
&quot;control commands&quot;, providing a more flexible
configuration scheme. However, if the user is expected to
know which <small>ENGINE</small> device he/she is using (in
the case of specialised hardware, this goes without saying)
then applications may not need to concern themselves with
discovering the supported control commands and simply prefer
to pass settings into ENGINEs exactly as they are provided
by the user.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Before
illustrating how control commands work, it is worth
mentioning what they are typically used for. Broadly
speaking there are two uses for control commands; the first
is to provide the necessary details to the implementation
(which may know nothing at all specific to the host system)
so that it can be initialised for use. This could include
the path to any driver or config files it needs to load,
required network addresses, smart-card identifiers,
passwords to initialise protected devices, logging
information, etc etc. This class of commands typically needs
to be passed to an <small>ENGINE</small> <b>before</b>
attempting to initialise it, ie. before calling
<i>ENGINE_init()</i>. The other class of commands consist of
settings or operations that tweak certain behaviour or cause
certain operations to take place, and these commands may
work either before or after <i>ENGINE_init()</i>, or in some
cases both. <small>ENGINE</small> implementations should
provide indications of this in the descriptions attached to
builtin control commands and/or in external product
documentation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Issuing
control commands to an <small>ENGINE</small></i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Let&rsquo;s
illustrate by example; a function for which the caller
supplies the name of the <small>ENGINE</small> it wishes to
use, a table of string-pairs for use before initialisation,
and another table for use after initialisation. Note that
the string-pairs used for control commands consist of a
command &quot;name&quot; followed by the command

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
<i>ENGINE_ctrl_cmd_string()</i> accepts a boolean argument
that can relax the semantics of the function &minus; if set
non-zero it will only return failure if the
<small>ENGINE</small> supported the given command name but
failed while executing it, if the <small>ENGINE</small>
doesn&rsquo;t support the command name it will simply return
success without doing anything. In this case we assume the
user is only supplying commands specific to the given
<small>ENGINE</small> so we set this to

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Discovering
supported control commands</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is possible
to discover at run-time the names, numerical-ids,
descriptions and input parameters of the control commands
supported by an <small>ENGINE</small> using a structural
reference. Note that some control commands are defined by
OpenSSL itself and it will intercept and handle these
control commands on behalf of the <small>ENGINE,</small> ie.
the <small>ENGINE</small> &rsquo;s <i>ctrl()</i> handler is
not used for the control command. openssl/engine.h defines
an index, <small>ENGINE_CMD_BASE,</small> that all control
commands implemented by ENGINEs should be numbered from. Any
command value lower than this symbol is considered a
&quot;generic&quot; command is handled directly by the
OpenSSL core routines.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is using
these &quot;core&quot; control commands that one can
discover the the control commands implemented by a given
<small>ENGINE,</small> specifically the commands;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Whilst these
commands are automatically processed by the OpenSSL
framework code, they use various properties exposed by each
<small>ENGINE</small> to process these queries. An
<small>ENGINE</small> has 3 properties it exposes that can
affect how this behaves; it can supply a <i>ctrl()</i>
handler, it can specify
<small>ENGINE_FLAGS_MANUAL_CMD_CTRL</small> in the
<small>ENGINE</small> &rsquo;s flags, and it can expose an
array of control command descriptions. If an
<small>ENGINE</small> specifies the
<small>ENGINE_FLAGS_MANUAL_CMD_CTRL</small> flag, then it
will simply pass all these &quot;core&quot; control commands
directly to the <small>ENGINE</small> &rsquo;s <i>ctrl()</i>
handler (and thus, it must have supplied one), so it is up
to the <small>ENGINE</small> to reply to these
&quot;discovery&quot; commands itself. If that flag is not
set, then the OpenSSL framework code will work with the
following rules;</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"> if no ctrl() handler supplied;
     ENGINE_HAS_CTRL_FUNCTION returns FALSE (zero),
     all other commands fail.
 if a ctrl() handler was supplied but no array of control commands;
     ENGINE_HAS_CTRL_FUNCTION returns TRUE,
     all other commands fail.
 if a ctrl() handler and array of control commands was supplied;
     ENGINE_HAS_CTRL_FUNCTION returns TRUE,
     all other commands proceed processing ...</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the
<small>ENGINE</small> &rsquo;s array of control commands is
empty then all other commands will fail, otherwise;
<small>ENGINE_CTRL_GET_FIRST_CMD_TYPE</small> returns the
identifier of the first command supported by the
<small>ENGINE, ENGINE_GET_NEXT_CMD_TYPE</small> takes the
identifier of a command supported by the
<small>ENGINE</small> and returns the next command
identifier or fails if there are no more,
<small>ENGINE_CMD_FROM_NAME</small> takes a string name for
a command and returns the corresponding identifier or fails
if no such command name exists, and the remaining commands
take a command identifier and return properties of the
corresponding commands. All except
<small>ENGINE_CTRL_GET_FLAGS</small> return the string
length of a command name or description, or populate a
supplied character buffer with a copy of the command name or
description. <small>ENGINE_CTRL_GET_FLAGS</small> returns a

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the
<small>ENGINE_CMD_FLAG_INTERNAL</small> flag is set, then
any other flags are purely informational to the caller
&minus; this flag will prevent the command being usable for
any higher-level <small>ENGINE</small> functions such as
<i>ENGINE_ctrl_cmd_string()</i>. &quot;
<small>INTERNAL&quot;</small> commands are not intended to
be exposed to text-based configuration by applications,
administrations, users, etc. These can support arbitrary
operations via <i>ENGINE_ctrl()</i>, including passing to
and/or from the control commands data of any arbitrary type.
These commands are supported in the discovery mechanisms
simply to allow applications determinie if an
<small>ENGINE</small> supports certain specific commands it
might want to use (eg. application &quot;foo&quot; might
query various ENGINEs to see if they implement &quot;
<small>FOO_GET_VENDOR_LOGO_GIF&quot; &minus;</small> and
<small>ENGINE</small> could therefore decide whether or not
to support this &quot;foo&quot;&minus;specific
extension).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Future
developments</b> <br>
The <small>ENGINE API</small> and internal architecture is
currently being reviewed. Slated for possible release in
0.9.8 is support for transparent loading of
&quot;dynamic&quot; ENGINEs (built as self-contained
shared-libraries). This would allow <small>ENGINE</small>
implementations to be provided independently of OpenSSL
libraries and/or OpenSSL-based applications, and would also
remove any requirement for applications to explicitly use
the &quot;dynamic&quot; <small>ENGINE</small> to bind to
shared-library implementations.</p>
