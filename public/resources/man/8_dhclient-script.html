<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">dhclient-script
- DHCP client network configuration script</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The DHCP client
network configuration script is invoked from time to time by
<b>dhclient(8)</b>. This script is used by the dhcp client
to set each interface&rsquo;s initial configuration prior to
requesting an address, to test the address once it has been
offered, and to set the interface&rsquo;s final
configuration once a lease has been acquired. If no lease is
acquired, the script is used to test predefined leases, if
any, and also called once if no valid lease can be
identified.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This script is
not meant to be customized by the end user. If local
customizations are needed, they should be possible using the
enter and exit hooks provided (see HOOKS for details). These
hooks will allow the user to override the default behaviour
of the client in creating a <b>/etc/resolv.conf</b> file,
and to handle DHCP options not handled by default.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">No standard
client script exists for some operating systems, even though
the actual client may work, so a pioneering user may well
need to create a new script or modify an existing one. In
general, customizations specific to a particular computer
should be done in the <b>/etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf</b> file.
If you find that you can&rsquo;t make such a customization
without customizing <b>/etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf</b> or using
the enter and exit hooks, please submit a bug report.</p>

<h2>HOOKS
<a name="HOOKS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When it starts,
the client script first defines a shell function,
<b>make_resolv_conf ,</b> which is later used to create the
<b>/etc/resolv.conf</b> file. To override the default
behaviour, redefine this function in the enter hook
script.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On after
defining the make_resolv_conf function, the client script
checks for the presence of an executable
<b>/etc/dhcp/dhclient-enter-hooks</b> script, and if
present, it invokes the script inline, using the Bourne
shell &acute;.&acute; command. The entire environment
documented under OPERATION is available to this script,
which may modify the environment if needed to change the
behaviour of the script. If an error occurs during the
execution of the script, it can set the exit_status variable
to a nonzero value, and <b>/usr/sbin/dhclient-script</b>
will exit with that error code immediately after the client
script exits.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">After all
processing has completed, <b>/usr/sbin/dhclient-script</b>
checks for the presence of an executable
<b>/etc/dhcp/dhclient-exit-hooks</b> script, which if
present is invoked using the &acute;.&acute; command. The
exit status of dhclient-script will be passed to
dhclient-exit-hooks in the exit_status shell variable, and
will always be zero if the script succeeded at the task for
which it was invoked. The rest of the environment as
described previously for dhclient-enter-hooks is also
present. The <b>/etc/dhcp/dhclient-exit-hooks</b> script can
modify the valid of exit_status to change the exit status of
dhclient-script.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Immediately
after dhclient brings an interface UP with a new IP address,
subnet mask, and routes, in the REBOOT/BOUND states, it will
check for the existence of an executable
<b>/etc/dhcp/dhclient-up-hooks</b> script, and source it if
found. This script can handle DHCP options in the
environment that are not handled by default. A
per-interface. <b>/etc/dhcp/dhclient-${IF}-up-hooks</b>
script will override the generic script and be sourced when
interface $IF has been brought up.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Immediately
before dhclient brings an interface DOWN, removing its IP
address, subnet mask, and routes, in the STOP/RELEASE
states, it will check for the existence of an executable
<b>/etc/dhcp/dhclient-down-hooks</b> script, and source it
if found. This script can handle DHCP options in the
environment that are not handled by default. A per-interface
<b>/etc/dhcp/dhclient-${IF}-down-hooks</b> script will
override the generic script and be sourced when interface
$IF is about to be brought down.</p>

<h2>OPERATION
<a name="OPERATION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When dhclient
needs to invoke the client configuration script, it defines
a set of variables in the environment, and then invokes
<b>/usr/sbin/dhclient-script.</b> In all cases, $reason is
set to the name of the reason why the script has been
invoked. The following reasons are currently defined:
MEDIUM, PREINIT, BOUND, RENEW, REBIND, REBOOT, EXPIRE, FAIL,
STOP, RELEASE, NBI and TIMEOUT.</p>

<h2>MEDIUM
<a name="MEDIUM"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The DHCP client
is requesting that an interface&rsquo;s media type be set.
The interface name is passed in $interface, and the media
type is passed in $medium.</p>

<h2>PREINIT
<a name="PREINIT"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The DHCP client
is requesting that an interface be configured as required in
order to send packets prior to receiving an actual address.
For clients which use the BSD socket library, this means
configuring the interface with an IP address of 0.0.0.0 and
a broadcast address of 255.255.255.255. For other clients,
it may be possible to simply configure the interface up
without actually giving it an IP address at all. The
interface name is passed in $interface, and the media type
in $medium.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If an IP alias
has been declared in dhclient.conf, its address will be
passed in $alias_ip_address, and that ip alias should be
deleted from the interface, along with any routes to it.</p>

<h2>BOUND
<a name="BOUND"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The DHCP client
has done an initial binding to a new address. The new ip
address is passed in $new_ip_address, and the interface name
is passed in $interface. The media type is passed in
$medium. Any options acquired from the server are passed
using the option name described in <b>dhcp-options</b>,
except that dashes (&acute;-&acute;) are replaced by
underscores (&acute;_&acute;) in order to make valid shell
variables, and the variable names start with new_. So for
example, the new subnet mask would be passed in
$new_subnet_mask. The options that the client explicitly
requested via a PRL or ORO option are passed with the same
option name as above but prepended with requested_ and with
a value of 1, or example requested_subnet_mask=1. No such
variable is defined for options not requested by the client
or options that don&rsquo;t require a request option, such
as the ip address (*_ip_address) or expiration time
(*_expiry).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Before actually
configuring the address, dhclient-script should somehow ARP
for it and exit with a nonzero status if it receives a
reply. In this case, the client will send a DHCPDECLINE
message to the server and acquire a different address. This
may also be done in the RENEW, REBIND, or REBOOT states, but
is not required, and indeed may not be desirable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When a binding
has been completed, a lot of network parameters are likely
to need to be set up. A new /etc/resolv.conf needs to be
created, using the values of $new_domain_name and
$new_domain_name_servers (which may list more than one
server, separated by spaces). A default route should be set
using $new_routers, and static routes may need to be set up
using $new_static_routes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If an IP alias
has been declared, it must be set up here. The alias IP
address will be written as $alias_ip_address, and other DHCP
options that are set for the alias (e.g., subnet mask) will
be passed in variables named as described previously except
starting with $alias_ instead of $new_. Care should be taken
that the alias IP address not be used if it is identical to
the bound IP address ($new_ip_address), since the other
alias parameters may be incorrect in this case.</p>

<h2>RENEW
<a name="RENEW"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When a binding
has been renewed, the script is called as in BOUND, except
that in addition to all the variables starting with $new_,
and $requested_ there is another set of variables starting
with $old_. Persistent settings that may have changed need
to be deleted - for example, if a local route to the bound
address is being configured, the old local route should be
deleted. If the default route has changed, the old default
route should be deleted. If the static routes have changed,
the old ones should be deleted. Otherwise, processing can be
done as with BOUND.</p>

<h2>REBIND
<a name="REBIND"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The DHCP client
has rebound to a new DHCP server. This can be handled as
with RENEW, except that if the IP address has changed, the
ARP table should be cleared.</p>

<h2>REBOOT
<a name="REBOOT"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The DHCP client
has successfully reacquired its old address after a reboot.
This can be processed as with BOUND.</p>

<h2>EXPIRE
<a name="EXPIRE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The DHCP client
has failed to renew its lease or acquire a new one, and the
lease has expired. The IP address must be relinquished, and
all related parameters should be deleted, as in RENEW and
REBIND.</p>

<h2>FAIL
<a name="FAIL"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The DHCP client
has been unable to contact any DHCP servers, and any leases
that have been tested have not proved to be valid. The
parameters from the last lease tested should be
deconfigured. This can be handled in the same way as
EXPIRE.</p>

<h2>STOP
<a name="STOP"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The dhclient
has been informed to shut down gracefully, the
dhclient-script should unconfigure or shutdown the interface
as appropriate.</p>

<h2>RELEASE
<a name="RELEASE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The dhclient
has been executed using the -r flag, indicating that the
administrator wishes it to release its lease(s).
dhclient-script should unconfigure or shutdown the
interface.</p>

<h2>NBI
<a name="NBI"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">No-Broadcast-Interfaces...dhclient
was unable to find any interfaces upon which it believed it
should commence DHCP. What dhclient-script should do in this
situation is entirely up to the implementor.</p>

<h2>TIMEOUT
<a name="TIMEOUT"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The DHCP client
has been unable to contact any DHCP servers. However, an old
lease has been identified, and its parameters have been
passed in as with BOUND. The client configuration script
should test these parameters and, if it has reason to
believe they are valid, should exit with a value of zero. If
not, it should exit with a nonzero value.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The usual way
to test a lease is to set up the network as with REBIND
(since this may be called to test more than one lease) and
then ping the first router defined in $routers. If a
response is received, the lease must be valid for the
network to which the interface is currently connected. It
would be more complete to try to ping all of the routers
listed in $new_routers, as well as those listed in
$new_static_routes, but current scripts do not do this.</p>

<h2>FILES
<a name="FILES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Each operating
system should generally have its own script file, although
the script files for similar operating systems may be
similar or even identical. The script files included in
Internet Systems Consortium DHCP distribution appear in the
distribution tree under client/scripts, and bear the names
of the operating systems on which they are intended to
work.</p>

<h2>BUGS
<a name="BUGS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If more than
one interface is being used, there&rsquo;s no obvious way to
avoid clashes between server-supplied configuration
parameters - for example, the stock dhclient-script rewrites
/etc/resolv.conf. If more than one interface is being
configured, /etc/resolv.conf will be repeatedly initialized
to the values provided by one server, and then the other.
Assuming the information provided by both servers is valid,
this shouldn&rsquo;t cause any real problems, but it could
be confusing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Normally, if
dhclient was compiled with libcap-ng support, dhclient drops
most capabilities immediately upon startup. While more
secure, this greatly restricts the additional actions that
hooks in dhclient-script can take. For example, any daemons
that dhclient-script starts or restarts will inherit the
restricted capabilities as well, which may interfere with
their correct operation. Thus, the <b>&minus;nc</b> option
can be used to prevent dhclient from dropping
capabilities.</p>
