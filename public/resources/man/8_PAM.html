<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">PAM, pam
&minus; Pluggable Authentication Modules for Linux</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This manual is
intended to offer a quick introduction to
<b>Linux&minus;PAM</b>. For more information the reader is
directed to the <b>Linux&minus;PAM system administrators'
guide</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Linux&minus;PAM</b>
is a system of libraries that handle the authentication
tasks of applications (services) on the system. The library
provides a stable general interface (Application Programming
Interface &minus; API) that privilege granting programs
(such as <b>login</b>(1) and <b>su</b>(1)) defer to to
perform standard authentication tasks.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The principal
feature of the PAM approach is that the nature of the
authentication is dynamically configurable. In other words,
the system administrator is free to choose how individual
service&minus;providing applications will authenticate
users. This dynamic configuration is set by the contents of
the single <b>Linux&minus;PAM</b> configuration file
/etc/pam.conf. Alternatively, the configuration can be set
by individual configuration files located in the /etc/pam.d/
directory. The presence of this directory will cause
<b>Linux&minus;PAM</b> to <i>ignore</i>/etc/pam.conf.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">From the point
of view of the system administrator, for whom this manual is
provided, it is not of primary importance to understand the
internal behavior of the <b>Linux&minus;PAM</b> library. The
important point to recognize is that the configuration
file(s) <i>define</i> the connection between applications
(<b>services</b>) and the pluggable authentication modules
(<b>PAM</b>s) that perform the actual authentication
tasks.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Linux&minus;PAM</b>
separates the tasks of <i>authentication</i> into four
independent management groups: <b>account</b> management;
<b>auth</b>entication management; <b>password</b>
management; and <b>session</b> management. (We highlight the
abbreviations used for these groups in the configuration
file.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Simply put,
these groups take care of different aspects of a typical
user's request for a restricted service:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>account</b>
&minus; provide account verification types of service: has
the user's password expired?; is this user permitted access
to the requested service?</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>auth</b>entication
&minus; authenticate a user and set up user credentials.
Typically this is via some challenge&minus;response request
that the user must satisfy: if you are who you claim to be
please enter your password. Not all authentications are of
this type, there exist hardware based authentication schemes
(such as the use of smart&minus;cards and biometric
devices), with suitable modules, these may be substituted
seamlessly for more standard approaches to authentication
&minus; such is the flexibility of
<b>Linux&minus;PAM</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>password</b>
&minus; this group's responsibility is the task of updating
authentication mechanisms. Typically, such services are
strongly coupled to those of the <b>auth</b> group. Some
authentication mechanisms lend themselves well to being
updated with such a function. Standard UN*X
password&minus;based access is the obvious example: please
enter a replacement password.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>session</b>
&minus; this group of tasks cover things that should be done
prior to a service being given and after it is withdrawn.
Such tasks include the maintenance of audit trails and the
mounting of the user's home directory. The <b>session</b>
management group is important as it provides both an opening
and closing hook for modules to affect the services
available to a user.</p>

<h2>FILES

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">/etc/pam.conf</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">the configuration file</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">/etc/pam.d</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">the <b>Linux&minus;PAM</b>
configuration directory. Generally, if this directory is
present, the /etc/pam.conf file is ignored.</p>

<h2>ERRORS
<a name="ERRORS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Typically
errors generated by the <b>Linux&minus;PAM</b> system of
libraries, will be written to <b>syslog</b>(3).</p>

remains backwardly compatible with this RFC.</p>
