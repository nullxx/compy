<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>verify</b> command verifies certificate chains.</p>

<h2>COMMAND OPTIONS
<a name="COMMAND OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;CApath
directory</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A directory of trusted
certificates. The certificates should have names of the
form: hash.0 or have symbolic links to them of this form
(&quot;hash&quot; is the hashed certificate subject name:
see the <b>&minus;hash</b> option of the <b>x509</b>
utility). Under Unix the <b>c_rehash</b> script will
automatically create symbolic links to a directory of
certificates.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;CAfile file</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A file of trusted certificates.
The file should contain multiple certificates in
<small>PEM</small> format concatenated together.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;untrusted
file</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A file of untrusted
certificates. The file should contain multiple certificates
in <small>PEM</small> format concatenated together.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;trusted_first</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Use certificates in
<small>CA</small> file or <small>CA</small> directory before
the certificates in the untrusted file when building the
trust chain to verify certificates. This is mainly useful in
environments with Bridge <small>CA</small> or
Cross-Certified CAs.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;purpose
purpose</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The intended use for the
certificate. If this option is not specified, <b>verify</b>
will not consider certificate purpose during chain
verification. Currently accepted uses are <b>sslclient</b>,
<b>sslserver</b>, <b>nssslserver</b>, <b>smimesign</b>,
<b>smimeencrypt</b>. See the <b><small>VERIFY
OPERATION</small></b> section for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;help</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Print out a usage message.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;verbose</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Print extra information about
the operations being performed.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;issuer_checks</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Print out diagnostics relating
to searches for the issuer certificate of the current
certificate. This shows why each candidate issuer
certificate was rejected. The presence of rejection messages
does not itself imply that anything is wrong; during the
normal verification process, several rejections may take
place.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;attime
timestamp</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Perform validation checks using
the time specified by <b>timestamp</b> and not the current
system time. <b>timestamp</b> is the number of seconds since
01.01.1970 ( <small>UNIX</small> time).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;policy arg</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Enable policy processing and
add <b>arg</b> to the user-initial-policy-set (see
<small>RFC5280</small> ). The policy <b>arg</b> can be an
object name an <small>OID</small> in numeric form. This
argument can appear more than once.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;policy_check</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Enables certificate policy
processing.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;explicit_policy</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Set policy variable
require-explicit-policy (see <small>RFC5280</small> ).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;inhibit_any</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Set policy variable
inhibit-any-policy (see <small>RFC5280</small> ).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Set policy variable
inhibit-policy-mapping (see <small>RFC5280</small> ).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;policy_print</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Print out diagnostics related
to policy processing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;crl_check</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Checks end entity certificate
validity by attempting to look up a valid
<small>CRL.</small> If a valid <small>CRL</small> cannot be
found an error occurs.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;crl_check_all</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Checks the validity of
<b>all</b> certificates in the chain by attempting to look
up valid CRLs.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;ignore_critical</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Normally if an unhandled
critical extension is present which is not supported by
OpenSSL the certificate is rejected (as required by
<small>RFC5280</small> ). If this option is set critical
extensions are ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;x509_strict</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">For strict X.509 compliance,
disable non-compliant workarounds for broken
certificates.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;extended_crl</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Enable extended
<small>CRL</small> features such as indirect CRLs and
alternate <small>CRL</small> signing keys.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;use_deltas</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Enable support for delta
CRLs.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;check_ss_sig</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Verify the signature on the
self-signed root <small>CA.</small> This is disabled by
default because it doesn&rsquo;t add any security.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

<p>Indicates the last option. All arguments following this
are assumed to be certificate files. This is useful if the
first certificate filename begins with a <b>&minus;</b>.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>certificates</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">One or more certificates to
verify. If no certificates are given, <b>verify</b> will
attempt to read a certificate from standard input.
Certificates must be in <small>PEM</small> format.</p>

<h2>VERIFY OPERATION
<a name="VERIFY OPERATION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>verify</b> program uses the same functions as the
internal <small>SSL</small> and S/MIME verification,
therefore this description applies to these verify
operations too.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There is one
crucial difference between the verify operations performed
by the <b>verify</b> program: wherever possible an attempt
is made to continue after an error whereas normally the
verify operation would halt on the first error. This allows
all the problems with a certificate chain to be
determined.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The verify
operation consists of a number of separate steps.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Firstly a
certificate chain is built up starting from the supplied
certificate and ending in the root <small>CA.</small> It is
an error if the whole chain cannot be built up. The chain is
built up by looking up the issuers certificate of the
current certificate. If a certificate is found which is its
own issuer it is assumed to be the root
<small>CA.</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The process of
&rsquo;looking up the issuers certificate&rsquo; itself
involves a number of steps. In versions of OpenSSL before
0.9.5a the first certificate whose subject name matched the
issuer of the current certificate was assumed to be the
issuers certificate. In OpenSSL 0.9.6 and later all
certificates whose subject name matches the issuer name of
the current certificate are subject to further tests. The
relevant authority key identifier components of the current
certificate (if present) must match the subject key
identifier (if present) and issuer and serial number of the
candidate issuer, in addition the keyUsage extension of the
candidate issuer (if present) must permit certificate
signing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The lookup
first looks in the list of untrusted certificates and if no
match is found the remaining lookups are from the trusted
certificates. The root <small>CA</small> is always looked up
in the trusted certificate list: if the certificate to
verify is a root certificate then an exact match must be
found in the trusted list.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The second
operation is to check every untrusted certificate&rsquo;s
extensions for consistency with the supplied purpose. If the
<b>&minus;purpose</b> option is not included then no checks
are done. The supplied or &quot;leaf&quot; certificate must
have extensions compatible with the supplied purpose and all
other certificates must also be valid <small>CA</small>
certificates. The precise extensions required are described
in more detail in the <b><small>CERTIFICATE
EXTENSIONS</small></b> section of the <b>x509</b>
utility.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The third
operation is to check the trust settings on the root
<small>CA.</small> The root <small>CA</small> should be
trusted for the supplied purpose. For compatibility with
previous versions of SSLeay and OpenSSL a certificate with
no trust settings is considered to be valid for all
purposes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The final
operation is to check the validity of the certificate chain.
The validity period is checked against the current system
time and the notBefore and notAfter dates in the
certificate. The certificate signatures are also checked at
this point.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If all
operations complete successfully then certificate is
considered valid. If any operation fails then the
certificate is not valid.</p>

<h2>DIAGNOSTICS
<a name="DIAGNOSTICS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When a verify
operation fails the output messages can be somewhat cryptic.
The general form of the error message is:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"> server.pem: /C=AU/ST=Queensland/O=CryptSoft Pty Ltd/CN=Test CA (1024 bit)
 error 24 at 1 depth lookup:invalid CA certificate</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The first line
contains the name of the certificate being verified followed
by the subject name of the certificate. The second line
contains the error number and the depth. The depth is number
of the certificate being verified when a problem was
detected starting with zero for the certificate being
verified itself then 1 for the <small>CA</small> that signed
the certificate and so on. Finally a text version of the
error number is presented.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">An exhaustive
list of the error codes and messages is shown below, this
also includes the name of the error code as defined in the
header file x509_vfy.h Some of the error codes are defined
but never returned: these are described as
&quot;unused&quot;. <b><br>

<h2>BUGS
<a name="BUGS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Although the
issuer checks are a considerably improvement over the old
technique they still suffer from limitations in the
underlying X509_LOOKUP <small>API.</small> One consequence
of this is that trusted certificates with matching subject
name must either appear in a file (as specified by the
<b>&minus;CAfile</b> option) or a directory (as specified by
<b>&minus;CApath</b>. If they occur in both then only the
certificates in the file will be recognised.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Previous
versions of OpenSSL assume certificates with matching
subject name are identical and mishandled them.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Previous
versions of this documentation swapped the meaning of the
<b>X509_V_ERR_UNABLE_TO_GET_ISSUER_CERT</b> and <b>20
X509_V_ERR_UNABLE_TO_GET_ISSUER_CERT_LOCALLY</b> error
codes.</p>
