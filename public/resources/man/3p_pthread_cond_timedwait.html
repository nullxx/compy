<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>pthread_cond_timedwait</i>() and
<i>pthread_cond_wait</i>() functions shall block on a
condition variable. They shall be called with <i>mutex</i>
locked by the calling thread or undefined behavior
results.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These functions
atomically release <i>mutex</i> and cause the calling thread
to block on the condition variable <i>cond</i>; atomically
here means &quot;atomically with respect to access by
another thread to the mutex and then the condition
variable&quot;. That is, if another thread is able to
acquire the mutex after the about-to-block thread has
released it, then a subsequent call to
<i>pthread_cond_broadcast</i>() or
<i>pthread_cond_signal</i>() in that thread shall behave as
if it were issued after the about-to-block thread has
blocked.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Upon successful
return, the mutex shall have been locked and shall be owned
by the calling thread.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When using
condition variables there is always a Boolean predicate
involving shared variables associated with each condition
wait that is true if the thread should proceed. Spurious
wakeups from the <i>pthread_cond_timedwait</i>() or
<i>pthread_cond_wait</i>() functions may occur. Since the
return from <i>pthread_cond_timedwait</i>() or
<i>pthread_cond_wait</i>() does not imply anything about the
value of this predicate, the predicate should be
re-evaluated upon such return.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The effect of
using more than one mutex for concurrent
<i>pthread_cond_timedwait</i>() or
<i>pthread_cond_wait</i>() operations on the same condition
variable is undefined; that is, a condition variable becomes
bound to a unique mutex when a thread waits on the condition
variable, and this (dynamic) binding shall end when the wait
returns.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A condition
wait (whether timed or not) is a cancellation point. When
the cancelability enable state of a thread is set to
PTHREAD_CANCEL_DEFERRED, a side effect of acting upon a
cancellation request while in a condition wait is that the
mutex is (in effect) re-acquired before calling the first
cancellation cleanup handler. The effect is as if the thread
were unblocked, allowed to execute up to the point of
returning from the call to <i>pthread_cond_timedwait</i>()
or <i>pthread_cond_wait</i>(), but at that point notices the
cancellation request and instead of returning to the caller
of <i>pthread_cond_timedwait</i>() or
<i>pthread_cond_wait</i>(), starts the thread cancellation
activities, which includes calling cancellation cleanup
handlers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A thread that
has been unblocked because it has been canceled while
blocked in a call to <i>pthread_cond_timedwait</i>() or
<i>pthread_cond_wait</i>() shall not consume any condition
signal that may be directed concurrently at the condition
variable if there are other threads blocked on the condition
variable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>pthread_cond_timedwait</i>() function shall be equivalent
to <i>pthread_cond_wait</i>(), except that an error is
returned if the absolute time specified by <i>abstime</i>
passes (that is, system time equals or exceeds
<i>abstime</i>) before the condition <i>cond</i> is signaled
or broadcasted, or if the absolute time specified by
<i>abstime</i> has already been passed at the time of the
call.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the Clock
Selection option is supported, the condition variable shall
have a clock attribute which specifies the clock that shall
be used to measure the time specified by the <i>abstime</i>
argument. When such timeouts occur,
<i>pthread_cond_timedwait</i>() shall nonetheless release
and re-acquire the mutex referenced by <i>mutex</i>. The
<i>pthread_cond_timedwait</i>() function is also a
cancellation point.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If a signal is
delivered to a thread waiting for a condition variable, upon
return from the signal handler the thread resumes waiting
for the condition variable as if it was not interrupted, or
it shall return zero due to spurious wakeup.</p>

<h2>RETURN VALUE
<a name="RETURN VALUE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Except in the
case of [ETIMEDOUT], all these error checks shall act as if
they were performed immediately at the beginning of
processing for the function and shall cause an error return,
in effect, prior to modifying the state of the mutex
specified by <i>mutex</i> or the condition variable
specified by <i>cond</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Upon successful
completion, a value of zero shall be returned; otherwise, an
error number shall be returned to indicate the error.</p>

<h2>RATIONALE
<a name="RATIONALE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Condition
Wait Semantics</b> <br>
It is important to note that when <i>pthread_cond_wait</i>()
and <i>pthread_cond_timedwait</i>() return without error,
the associated predicate may still be false. Similarly, when
<i>pthread_cond_timedwait</i>() returns with the timeout
error, the associated predicate may be true due to an
unavoidable race between the expiration of the timeout and
the predicate state change.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Some
implementations, particularly on a multi-processor, may
sometimes cause multiple threads to wake up when the
condition variable is signaled simultaneously on different
processors.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In general,
whenever a condition wait returns, the thread has to
re-evaluate the predicate associated with the condition wait
to determine whether it can safely proceed, should wait
again, or should declare a timeout. A return from the wait
does not imply that the associated predicate is either true
or false.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is thus
recommended that a condition wait be enclosed in the
equivalent of a &quot;while loop&quot; that checks the
predicate.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Timed Wait
Semantics</b> <br>
An absolute time measure was chosen for specifying the
timeout parameter for two reasons. First, a relative time
measure can be easily implemented on top of a function that
specifies absolute time, but there is a race condition
associated with specifying an absolute timeout on top of a
function that specifies relative timeouts. For example,
assume that <i>clock_gettime</i>() returns the current time
and <i>cond_relative_timed_wait</i>() uses relative
timeouts:</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>clock_gettime(CLOCK_REALTIME,
&amp;now) <br>
reltime = sleep_til_this_absolute_time -now; <br>
cond_relative_timed_wait(c, m, &amp;reltime);</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the thread
is preempted between the first statement and the last
statement, the thread blocks for too long. Blocking,
however, is irrelevant if an absolute timeout is used. An
absolute timeout also need not be recomputed if it is used
multiple times in a loop, such as that enclosing a condition
wait.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For cases when
the system clock is advanced discontinuously by an operator,
it is expected that implementations process any timed wait
expiring at an intervening time as if that time had actually
occurred.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Cancellation
and Condition Wait</b> <br>
A condition wait, whether timed or not, is a cancellation
point. That is, the functions <i>pthread_cond_wait</i>() or
<i>pthread_cond_timedwait</i>() are points where a pending
(or concurrent) cancellation request is noticed. The reason
for this is that an indefinite wait is possible at these
points-whatever event is being waited for, even if the
program is totally correct, might never occur; for example,
some input data being awaited might never be sent. By making
condition wait a cancellation point, the thread can be
canceled and perform its cancellation cleanup handler even
though it may be stuck in some indefinite wait.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A side effect
of acting on a cancellation request while a thread is
blocked on a condition variable is to re-acquire the mutex
before calling any of the cancellation cleanup handlers.
This is done in order to ensure that the cancellation
cleanup handler is executed in the same state as the
critical code that lies both before and after the call to
the condition wait function. This rule is also required when
interfacing to POSIX threads from languages, such as Ada or
C++, which may choose to map cancellation onto a language
exception; this rule ensures that each exception handler
guarding a critical section can always safely depend upon
the fact that the associated mutex has already been locked
regardless of exactly where within the critical section the
exception was raised. Without this rule, there would not be
a uniform rule that exception handlers could follow
regarding the lock, and so coding would become very
cumbersome.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Therefore,
since <i>some</i> statement has to be made regarding the
state of the lock when a cancellation is delivered during a
wait, a definition has been chosen that makes application
coding most convenient and error free.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When acting on
a cancellation request while a thread is blocked on a
condition variable, the implementation is required to ensure
that the thread does not consume any condition signals
directed at that condition variable if there are any other
threads waiting on that condition variable. This rule is
specified in order to avoid deadlock conditions that could
occur if these two independent requests (one acting on a
thread and the other acting on the condition variable) were
not processed independently.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Performance
of Mutexes and Condition Variables</b> <br>
Mutexes are expected to be locked only for a few
instructions. This practice is almost automatically enforced
by the desire of programmers to avoid long serial regions of
execution (which would reduce total effective
parallelism).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When using
mutexes and condition variables, one tries to ensure that
the usual case is to lock the mutex, access shared data, and
unlock the mutex. Waiting on a condition variable should be
a relatively rare situation. For example, when implementing
a read-write lock, code that acquires a read-lock typically
needs only to increment the count of readers (under
mutual-exclusion) and return. The calling thread would
actually wait on the condition variable only when there is
already an active writer. So the efficiency of a
synchronization operation is bounded by the cost of mutex
lock/unlock and not by condition wait. Note that in the
usual case there is no context switch.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This is not to
say that the efficiency of condition waiting is unimportant.
Since there needs to be at least one context switch per Ada
rendezvous, the efficiency of waiting on a condition
variable is important. The cost of waiting on a condition
variable should be little more than the minimal cost for a
context switch plus the time to unlock and lock the
mutex.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Features of
Mutexes and Condition Variables</b> <br>
It had been suggested that the mutex acquisition and release
be decoupled from condition wait. This was rejected because
it is the combined nature of the operation that, in fact,
facilitates realtime implementations. Those implementations
can atomically move a high-priority thread between the
condition variable and the mutex in a manner that is
transparent to the caller. This can prevent extra context
switches and provide more deterministic acquisition of a
mutex when the waiting thread is signaled. Thus, fairness
and priority issues can be dealt with directly by the
scheduling discipline. Furthermore, the current condition
wait operation matches existing practice.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Scheduling
Behavior of Mutexes and Condition Variables</b> <br>
Synchronization primitives that attempt to interfere with
scheduling policy by specifying an ordering rule are
considered undesirable. Threads waiting on mutexes and
condition variables are selected to proceed in an order
dependent upon the scheduling policy rather than in some
fixed order (for example, FIFO or priority). Thus, the
scheduling policy determines which thread(s) are awakened
and allowed to proceed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Timed
Condition Wait</b> <br>
The <i>pthread_cond_timedwait</i>() function allows an
application to give up waiting for a particular condition
after a given amount of time. An example of its use
follows:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>(void)
pthread_mutex_lock(&amp;t.mn); <br>
t.waiters++; <br>
clock_gettime(CLOCK_REALTIME, &amp;ts); <br>
ts.tv_sec += 5; <br>
rc = 0; <br>
while (! mypredicate(&amp;t) &amp;&amp; rc == 0) <br>
rc = pthread_cond_timedwait(&amp;t.cond, &amp;t.mn,
&amp;ts); <br>
t.waiters--; <br>
if (rc == 0) setmystate(&amp;t); <br>
(void) pthread_mutex_unlock(&amp;t.mn);</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">By making the
timeout parameter absolute, it does not need to be
recomputed each time the program checks its blocking
predicate. If the timeout was relative, it would have to be
recomputed before each call. This would be especially
difficult since such code would need to take into account
the possibility of extra wakeups that result from extra
broadcasts or signals on the condition variable that occur
before either the predicate is true or the timeout is
due.</p>
