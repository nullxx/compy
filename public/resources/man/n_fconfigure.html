_________________________________________________________________</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>fconfigure</b> command sets and retrieves options for
channels.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>ChannelId</i>
identifies the channel for which to set or query an option
and must refer to an open channel such as a Tcl standard
channel (<b>stdin</b>, <b>stdout</b>, or <b>stderr</b>), the
return value from an invocation of <b>open</b> or
<b>socket</b>, or the result of a channel creation command
provided by a Tcl extension.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If no
<i>name</i> or <i>value</i> arguments are supplied, the
command returns a list containing alternating option names
and values for the channel. If <i>name</i> is supplied but
no <i>value</i> then the command returns the current value
of the given option. If one or more pairs of <i>name</i> and
<i>value</i> are supplied, the command sets each of the
named options to the corresponding <i>value</i>; in this
case the return value is an empty string.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The options
described below are supported for all channels. In addition,
each channel type may add options that only it supports. See
the manual entry for the command that creates each type of
channels for the options that that specific type of channel
supports. For example, see the manual entry for the
<b>socket</b> command for its additional options. <b><br>
&minus;blocking</b> <i>boolean</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The <b>&minus;blocking</b>
option determines whether I/O operations on the channel can
cause the process to block indefinitely. The value of the
option must be a proper boolean value. Channels are normally
in blocking mode; if a channel is placed into nonblocking
mode it will affect the operation of the <b>gets</b>,
<b>read</b>, <b>puts</b>, <b>flush</b>, and <b>close</b>
commands by allowing them to operate asynchronously; see the
documentation for those commands for details. For
nonblocking mode to work correctly, the application must be
using the Tcl event loop (e.g. by calling
<b>Tcl_DoOneEvent</b> or invoking the <b>vwait</b>
command).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;buffering</b>
<i>newValue</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If <i>newValue</i> is
<b>full</b> then the I/O system will buffer output until its
internal buffer is full or until the <b>flush</b> command is
invoked. If <i>newValue</i> is <b>line</b>, then the I/O
system will automatically flush output for the channel
whenever a newline character is output. If <i>newValue</i>
is <b>none</b>, the I/O system will flush automatically
after every output operation. The default is for
<b>&minus;buffering</b> to be set to <b>full</b> except for
channels that connect to terminal-like devices; for these
channels the initial setting is <b>line</b>. Additionally,
<b>stdin</b> and <b>stdout</b> are initially set to
<b>line</b>, and <b>stderr</b> is set to <b>none</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;buffersize</b>
<i>newSize</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><i>Newvalue</i> must be an
integer; its value is used to set the size of buffers, in
bytes, subsequently allocated for this channel to store
input or output. <i>Newvalue</i> must be between ten and one
million, allowing buffers of ten to one million bytes in
size.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;encoding</b>
<i>name</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This option is used to specify
the encoding of the channel, so that the data can be
converted to and from Unicode for use in Tcl. For instance,
in order for Tcl to read characters from a Japanese file in
<b>shiftjis</b> and properly process and display the
contents, the encoding would be set to <b>shiftjis</b>.
Thereafter, when reading from the channel, the bytes in the
Japanese file would be converted to Unicode as they are
read. Writing is also supported &minus; as Tcl strings are
written to the channel they will automatically be converted
to the specified encoding on output.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If a file
contains pure binary data (for instance, a JPEG image), the
encoding for the channel should be configured to be
<b>binary</b>. Tcl will then assign no interpretation to the
data in the file and simply read or write raw bytes. The Tcl
<b>binary</b> command can be used to manipulate this
byte-oriented data. It is usually better to set the
<b>&minus;translation</b> option to <b>binary</b> when you
want to transfer binary data, as this turns off the other
automatic interpretations of the bytes in the stream as
well.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The default
encoding for newly opened channels is the same platform- and
locale-dependent system encoding used for interfacing with
the operating system, as returned by <b>encoding
system</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;eofchar</b>
<i>char</i> <b><br>
&minus;eofchar {</b><i>inChar outChar</i><b>}</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This option supports DOS file
systems that use Control-z (\x1a) as an end of file marker.
If <i>char</i> is not an empty string, then this character
signals end-of-file when it is encountered during input. For
output, the end-of-file character is output when the channel
is closed. If <i>char</i> is the empty string, then there is
no special end of file character marker. For read-write
channels, a two-element list specifies the end of file
marker for input and output, respectively. As a convenience,
when setting the end-of-file character for a read-write
channel you can specify a single value that will apply to
both reading and writing. When querying the end-of-file
character of a read-write channel, a two-element list will
always be returned. The default value for
<b>&minus;eofchar</b> is the empty string in all cases
except for files under Windows. In that case the
<b>&minus;eofchar</b> is Control-z (\x1a) for reading and
the empty string for writing. The acceptable range for
<b>&minus;eofchar</b> values is \x01 - \x7f; attempting to
set <b>&minus;eofchar</b> to a value outside of this range
will generate an error.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;translation</b>
<i>mode</i> <b><br>
&minus;translation {</b><i>inMode outMode</i><b>}</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">In Tcl scripts the end of a
line is always represented using a single newline character
(\n). However, in actual files and devices the end of a line
may be represented differently on different platforms, or
even for different devices on the same platform. For
example, under UNIX newlines are used in files, whereas
carriage-return-linefeed sequences are normally used in
network connections. On input (i.e., with <b>gets</b> and
<b>read</b>) the Tcl I/O system automatically translates the
external end-of-line representation into newline characters.
Upon output (i.e., with <b>puts</b>), the I/O system
translates newlines to the external end-of-line
representation. The default translation mode, <b>auto</b>,
handles all the common cases automatically, but the
<b>&minus;translation</b> option provides explicit control
over the end of line translations.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The value
associated with <b>&minus;translation</b> is a single item
for read-only and write-only channels. The value is a
two-element list for read-write channels; the read
translation mode is the first element of the list, and the
write translation mode is the second element. As a
convenience, when setting the translation mode for a
read-write channel you can specify a single value that will
apply to both reading and writing. When querying the
translation mode of a read-write channel, a two-element list
will always be returned. The following values are currently
supported:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="22%"></td>
<td width="9%">


<p><b>auto</b></p></td>
<td width="1%"></td>
<td width="68%">


<p>As the input translation mode, <b>auto</b> treats any of
newline (<b>lf</b>), carriage return (<b>cr</b>), or
carriage return followed by a newline (<b>crlf</b>) as the
end of line representation. The end of line representation
can even change from line-to-line, and all cases are
translated to a newline. As the output translation mode,
<b>auto</b> chooses a platform specific representation; for
sockets on all platforms Tcl chooses <b>crlf</b>, for all
Unix flavors, it chooses <b>lf</b>, and for the various
flavors of Windows it chooses <b>crlf</b>. The default
setting for <b>&minus;translation</b> is <b>auto</b> for
both input and output.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="22%"></td>
<td width="9%">


<p><b>binary</b></p></td>
<td width="1%"></td>
<td width="68%">


<p>No end-of-line translations are performed. This is
nearly identical to <b>lf</b> mode, except that in addition
<b>binary</b> mode also sets the end-of-file character to
the empty string (which disables it) and sets the encoding
to <b>binary</b> (which disables encoding filtering). See
the description of <b>&minus;eofchar</b> and
<b>&minus;encoding</b> for more information.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:32%; margin-top: 1em">Internally,
i.e. when it comes to the actual behaviour of the translator
this value <b>is</b> identical to <b>lf</b> and is therefore
reported as such when queried. Even if <b>binary</b> was
used to set the translation.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="22%"></td>
<td width="6%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>cr</b></p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="68%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">The end of a line in the
underlying file or device is represented by a single
carriage return character. As the input translation mode,
<b>cr</b> mode converts carriage returns to newline
characters. As the output translation mode, <b>cr</b> mode
translates newline characters to carriage returns.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="22%"></td>
<td width="6%">


<p><b>crlf</b></p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="68%">


<p>The end of a line in the underlying file or device is
represented by a carriage return character followed by a
linefeed character. As the input translation mode,
<b>crlf</b> mode converts carriage-return-linefeed sequences
to newline characters. As the output translation mode,
<b>crlf</b> mode translates newline characters to
carriage-return-linefeed sequences. This mode is typically
used on Windows platforms and for network connections.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="22%"></td>
<td width="6%">


<p><b>lf</b></p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="68%">


<p>The end of a line in the underlying file or device is
represented by a single newline (linefeed) character. In
this mode no translations occur during either input or
output. This mode is typically used on UNIX platforms.</p></td></tr>

<h2>STANDARD CHANNELS
<a name="STANDARD CHANNELS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The Tcl
standard channels (<b>stdin</b>, <b>stdout</b>, and
<b>stderr</b>) can be configured through this command like
every other channel opened by the Tcl library. Beyond the
standard options described above they will also support any
special option according to their current type. If, for
example, a Tcl application is started by the <b>inet</b>
super-server common on Unix system its Tcl standard channels
will be sockets and thus support the socket options.</p>

<h2>EXAMPLES
