<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">perldiag
&minus; various Perl diagnostics</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These messages
are classified as follows (listed in increasing order of
desperation):</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    (W) A warning (optional).
    (D) A deprecation (enabled by default).
    (S) A severe warning (enabled by default).
    (F) A fatal error (trappable).
    (P) An internal error you should never see (trappable).
    (X) A very fatal error (nontrappable).
    (A) An alien error message (not generated by Perl).</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The majority of
messages from the first three classifications above (W, D
&amp; S) can be controlled using the
<tt>&quot;warnings&quot;</tt> pragma.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If a message
can be controlled by the <tt>&quot;warnings&quot;</tt>
pragma, its warning category is included with the
classification letter in the description below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Optional
warnings are enabled by using the
<tt>&quot;warnings&quot;</tt> pragma or the <b>&minus;w</b>
and <b>&minus;W</b> switches. Warnings may be captured by
setting <tt>$SIG{__WARN__}</tt> to a reference to a routine
that will be called on each warning instead of printing it.
See perlvar.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Severe warnings
are always enabled, unless they are explicitly disabled with
the <tt>&quot;warnings&quot;</tt> pragma or the
<b>&minus;X</b> switch.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Trappable
errors may be trapped using the eval operator. See
&quot;eval&quot; in perlfunc. In almost all cases, warnings
may be selectively disabled or promoted to fatal errors
using the <tt>&quot;warnings&quot;</tt> pragma. See
warnings.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The messages
are in alphabetical order, without regard to upper or
lower-case. Some of these messages are generic. Spots that
vary are denoted with a <tt>%s</tt> or other printf-style
escape. These escapes are ignored by the alphabetical order,
as are all characters other than letters. To look up your
message, just ignore anything that is not a letter. <i><br>
accept()</i> on closed socket %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W closed) You tried to do an
accept on a closed socket. Did you forget to check the
return value of your <i>socket()</i> call? See
&quot;accept&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Allocation too large: %x</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(X) You can&rsquo;t allocate
more than 64K on an MS-DOS machine.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&rsquo;%c&rsquo; allowed only
after types %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The modifiers
&rsquo;!&rsquo;, &rsquo;&lt;&rsquo; and &rsquo;&gt;&rsquo;
are allowed in <i>pack()</i> or <i>unpack()</i> only after
certain types. See &quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Ambiguous call resolved as
CORE::%s(), qualify as such or use &amp;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W ambiguous) A subroutine you
have declared has the same name as a Perl keyword, and you
have used the name without qualification for calling one or
the other. Perl decided to call the builtin because the
subroutine is not imported.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">To force
interpretation as a subroutine call, either put an ampersand
before the subroutine name, or qualify the name with its
package. Alternatively, you can import the subroutine (or
pretend that it&rsquo;s imported with the <tt>&quot;use
subs&quot;</tt> pragma).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">To silently
interpret it as the Perl operator, use the
<tt>&quot;CORE::&quot;</tt> prefix on the operator (e.g.
<tt>&quot;CORE::log($x)&quot;</tt>) or declare the
subroutine to be an object method (see &quot;Subroutine
Attributes&quot; in perlsub or attributes).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Ambiguous range in
transliteration operator</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You wrote something like
<tt>&quot;tr/a&minus;z&minus;0//&quot;</tt> which
doesn&rsquo;t mean anything at all. To include a
<tt>&quot;&minus;&quot;</tt> character in a transliteration,
put it either first or last. (In the past,
<tt>&quot;tr/a&minus;z&minus;0//&quot;</tt> was synonymous
with <tt>&quot;tr/a&minus;y//&quot;</tt>, which was probably
not what you would have expected.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Ambiguous use of %s resolved as
%s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W ambiguous)(S) You said
something that may not be interpreted the way you thought.
Normally it&rsquo;s pretty easy to disambiguate it by
supplying a missing quote, operator, parenthesis pair or
declaration.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Ambiguous use of %c resolved as
operator %c</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W ambiguous)
<tt>&quot;%&quot;</tt>, <tt>&quot;&amp;&quot;</tt>, and
<tt>&quot;*&quot;</tt> are both infix operators (modulus,
bitwise and, and multiplication) <i>and</i> initial special
characters (denoting hashes, subroutines and typeglobs), and
you said something like <tt>&quot;*foo * foo&quot;</tt> that
might be interpreted as either of them. We assumed you meant
the infix operator, but please try to make it more clear --
in the example given, you might write <tt>&quot;*foo *
foo()&quot;</tt> if you really meant to multiply a glob by
the result of calling a function.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Ambiguous use of %c{%s}
resolved to %c%s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W ambiguous) You wrote
something like <tt>&quot;@{foo}&quot;</tt>, which might be
asking for the variable <tt>@foo</tt>, or it might be
calling a function named foo, and dereferencing it as an
array reference. If you wanted the variable, you can just
write <tt>@foo</tt>. If you wanted to call the function,
write <tt>&quot;@{foo()}&quot;</tt> ... or you could just
not have a variable and a function with the same name, and
save yourself a lot of trouble.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Ambiguous use of %c{%s[...]}
resolved to %c%s[...] <br>
Ambiguous use of %c{%s{...}} resolved to %c%s{...}</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W ambiguous) You wrote
something like <tt>&quot;${foo[2]}&quot;</tt> (where foo
represents the name of a Perl keyword), which might be
looking for element number 2 of the array named
<tt>@foo</tt>, in which case please write <tt>$foo[2]</tt>,
or you might have meant to pass an anonymous arrayref to the
function named foo, and then do a scalar deref on the value
it returns. If you meant that, write
<tt>&quot;${foo([2])}&quot;</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">In regular
expressions, the <tt>&quot;${foo[2]}&quot;</tt> syntax is
sometimes necessary to disambiguate between array subscripts
and character classes. <tt>&quot;/$length[2345]/&quot;</tt>,
for instance, will be interpreted as <tt>$length</tt>
followed by the character class <tt>&quot;[2345]&quot;</tt>.
If an array subscript is what you want, you can avoid the
warning by changing <tt>&quot;/${length[2345]}/&quot;</tt>
to the unsightly <tt>&quot;/${\$length[2345]}/&quot;</tt>,
by renaming your array to something that does not coincide
with a built-in keyword, or by simply turning off warnings
with <tt>&quot;no warnings 'ambiguous';&quot;</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Ambiguous use of &minus;%s
resolved as &minus;&amp;%s()</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W ambiguous) You wrote
something like <tt>&quot;&minus;foo&quot;</tt>, which might
be the string <tt>&quot;&minus;foo&quot;</tt>, or a call to
the function <tt>&quot;foo&quot;</tt>, negated. If you meant
the string, just write <tt>&quot;&minus;foo&quot;</tt>. If
you meant the function call, write
<tt>&quot;&minus;foo()&quot;</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Ambiguous use of
&rsquo;s//le...&rsquo; resolved as &rsquo;s// le...&rsquo;;
Rewrite as &rsquo;s//el&rsquo; <br>
if you meant &rsquo;use locale rules and evaluate rhs as an
expression&rsquo;. In <br>
Perl 5.18, it will be resolved the other way</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W deprecated, ambiguous) You
wrote a pattern match with substitution immediately followed
by &quot;le&quot;. In Perl 5.16 and earlier, this is
resolved as meaning to take the result of the substitution,
and see if it is stringwise less-than-or-equal-to what
follows in the expression. Having the &quot;le&quot;
immediately following a pattern is deprecated behavior, so
in Perl 5.18, this expression will be resolved as meaning to
do the pattern match using the rules of the current locale,
and evaluate the rhs as an expression when doing the
substitution. In 5.14, and 5.16 if you want the latter
interpretation, you can simply write &quot;el&quot; instead.
But note that the <tt>&quot;/l&quot;</tt> modifier should
not be used explicitly anyway; you should use <tt>&quot;use
locale&quot;</tt> instead. See perllocale.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&rsquo;|&rsquo; and
&rsquo;&lt;&rsquo; may not both be specified on command
line</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) An error peculiar to
<small>VMS</small> . Perl does its own command line
redirection, and found that <small>STDIN</small> was a pipe,
and that you also tried to redirect <small>STDIN</small>
using &rsquo;&lt;&rsquo;. Only one <small>STDIN</small>
stream to a customer, please.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&rsquo;|&rsquo; and
&rsquo;&gt;&rsquo; may not both be specified on command
line</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) An error peculiar to
<small>VMS</small> . Perl does its own command line
redirection, and thinks you tried to redirect stdout both to
a file and into a pipe to another command. You need to
choose one or the other, though nothing&rsquo;s stopping you
from piping into a program or Perl script which
&rsquo;splits&rsquo; output into two streams, such as</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    open(OUT,&quot;&gt;$ARGV[0]&quot;) or die &quot;Can't write to $ARGV[0]: $!&quot;;
    while (&lt;STDIN&gt;) {
        print;
        print OUT;
    }
    close OUT;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%;">Applying %s to %s will act on
scalar(%s)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W misc) The pattern match
(<tt>&quot;//&quot;</tt>), substitution
(<tt>&quot;s///&quot;</tt>), and transliteration
(<tt>&quot;tr///&quot;</tt>) operators work on scalar
values. If you apply one of them to an array or a hash, it
will convert the array or hash to a scalar value (the length
of an array, or the population info of a hash) and then work
on that scalar value. This is probably not what you meant to
do. See &quot;grep&quot; in perlfunc and &quot;map&quot; in
perlfunc for alternatives.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Arg too short for msgsnd</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) <i>msgsnd()</i> requires a
string at least as long as sizeof(long).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">%s argument is not a
<small>HASH</small> or <small>ARRAY</small> element or a
subroutine</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The argument to
<i>exists()</i> must be a hash or array element or a
subroutine with an ampersand, such as:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    $foo{$bar}
    $ref&minus;&gt;{&quot;susie&quot;}[12]
    &amp;do_something</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%;">%s argument is not a
<small>HASH</small> or <small>ARRAY</small> element or
slice</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The argument to
<i>delete()</i> must be either a hash or array element, such
as:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    $foo{$bar}
    $ref&minus;&gt;{&quot;susie&quot;}[12]</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">or a hash or
array slice, such as:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    @foo[$bar, $baz, $xyzzy]
    @{$ref&minus;&gt;[12]}{&quot;susie&quot;, &quot;queue&quot;}</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%;">%s argument is not a subroutine
name</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The argument to
<i>exists()</i> for <tt>&quot;exists &amp;sub&quot;</tt>
must be a subroutine name, and not a subroutine call.
<tt>&quot;exists &amp;sub()&quot;</tt> will generate this
error.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Argument &quot;%s&quot;
isn&rsquo;t numeric%s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W numeric) The indicated
string was fed as an argument to an operator that expected a
numeric value instead. If you&rsquo;re fortunate the message
will identify which operator was so unfortunate.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Argument list not closed for
PerlIO layer &quot;%s&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W layer) When pushing a layer
with arguments onto the Perl I/O system you forgot the )
that closes the argument list. (Layers take care of
transforming data between external and internal
representations.) Perl stopped parsing the layer list at
this point and did not attempt to push this layer. If your
program didn&rsquo;t explicitly request the failing
operation, it may be the result of the value of the
environment variable <small>PERLIO</small> .</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Array @%s missing the @ in
argument %d of %s()</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(D deprecated) Really old Perl
let you omit the @ on array names in some spots. This is now
heavily deprecated.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">assertion botched: %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(X) The malloc package that
comes with Perl had an internal failure.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Assertion failed: file
&quot;%s&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(X) A general assertion failed.
The file in question must be examined.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Assigning non-zero to $[ is no
longer possible</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) When the
&quot;array_base&quot; feature is disabled (e.g., under
<tt>&quot;use v5.16;&quot;</tt>) the special variable
<tt>$[</tt>, which is deprecated, is now a fixed zero
value.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Assignment to both a list and a
scalar</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) If you assign to a
conditional operator, the 2nd and 3rd arguments must either
both be scalars or both be lists. Otherwise Perl won&rsquo;t
know which context to supply to the right side.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">A thread exited while %d
threads were running</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W threads)(S) When using
threaded Perl, a thread (not necessarily the main thread)
exited while there were still other threads running. Usually
it&rsquo;s a good idea first to collect the return values of
the created threads by joining them, and only then to exit
from the main thread. See threads.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Attempt to access disallowed
key &rsquo;%s&rsquo; in a restricted hash</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The failing code has
attempted to get or set a key which is not in the current
set of allowed keys of a restricted hash.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Attempt to bless into a
reference</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The
<small>CLASSNAME</small> argument to the <i>bless()</i>
operator is expected to be the name of the package to bless
the resulting object into. You&rsquo;ve supplied instead a
reference to something: perhaps you wrote</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    bless $self, $proto;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">when you
intended</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    bless $self, ref($proto) || $proto;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If you actually
want to bless into the stringified version of the reference
supplied, you need to stringify it yourself, for example
by:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    bless $self, &quot;$proto&quot;;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%;">Attempt to clear deleted
array</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S debugging) An array was
assigned to when it was being freed. Freed values are not
supposed to be visible to Perl code. This can also happen if
<small>XS</small> code calls <tt>&quot;av_clear&quot;</tt>
from a custom magic callback on the array.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Attempt to delete disallowed
key &rsquo;%s&rsquo; from a restricted hash</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The failing code attempted
to delete from a restricted hash a key which is not in its
key set.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Attempt to delete readonly key
&rsquo;%s&rsquo; from a restricted hash</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The failing code attempted
to delete a key whose value has been declared readonly from
a restricted hash.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Attempt to free non-arena
<small>SV:</small> 0x%x</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S internal) All
<small>SV</small> objects are supposed to be allocated from
arenas that will be garbage collected on exit. An
<small>SV</small> was discovered to be outside any of those
arenas.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Attempt to free nonexistent
shared string &rsquo;%s&rsquo;%s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S internal) Perl maintains a
reference-counted internal table of strings to optimize the
storage and access of hash keys and other strings. This
indicates someone tried to decrement the reference count of
a string that can no longer be found in the table.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Attempt to free temp
prematurely: <small>SV</small> 0x%x</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S debugging) Mortalized values
are supposed to be freed by the <i>free_tmps()</i> routine.
This indicates that something else is freeing the
<small>SV</small> before the <i>free_tmps()</i> routine gets
a chance, which means that the <i>free_tmps()</i> routine
will be freeing an unreferenced scalar when it does try to
free it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Attempt to free unreferenced
glob pointers</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S internal) The reference
counts got screwed up on symbol aliases.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Attempt to free unreferenced
scalar: <small>SV</small> 0x%x</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W internal) Perl went to
decrement the reference count of a scalar to see if it would
go to 0, and discovered that it had already gone to 0
earlier, and should have been freed, and in fact, probably
was freed. This could indicate that <i>SvREFCNT_dec()</i>
was called too many times, or that <i>SvREFCNT_inc()</i> was
called too few times, or that the <small>SV</small> was
mortalized when it shouldn&rsquo;t have been, or that memory
has been corrupted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Attempt to join self</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You tried to join a thread
from within itself, which is an impossible task. You may be
joining the wrong thread, or you may need to move the
<i>join()</i> to some other thread.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Attempt to pack pointer to
temporary value</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W pack) You tried to pass a
temporary value (like the result of a function, or a
computed expression) to the &quot;p&quot; <i>pack()</i>
template. This means the result contains a pointer to a
location that could become invalid anytime, even before the
end of the current statement. Use literals or global values
as arguments to the &quot;p&quot; <i>pack()</i> template to
avoid this warning.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Attempt to reload %s
aborted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You tried to load a file
with <tt>&quot;use&quot;</tt> or
<tt>&quot;require&quot;</tt> that failed to compile once
already. Perl will not try to compile this file again unless
you delete its entry from <tt>%INC</tt>. See
&quot;require&quot; in perlfunc and &quot;%INC&quot; in
perlvar.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Attempt to set length of freed
array</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W) You tried to set the length
of an array which has been freed. You can do this by storing
a reference to the scalar representing the last index of an
array and later assigning through that reference. For
example</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    $r = do {my @a; \$#a};
    $$r = 503</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%;">Attempt to use reference as
lvalue in substr</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W substr) You supplied a
reference as the first argument to <i>substr()</i> used as
an lvalue, which is pretty strange. Perhaps you forgot to
dereference it first. See &quot;substr&quot; in
perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Attribute &quot;locked&quot; is
deprecated</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(D deprecated) You have used
the attributes pragma to modify the &quot;locked&quot;
attribute on a code reference. The :locked attribute is
obsolete, has had no effect since 5005 threads were removed,
and will be removed in a future release of Perl 5.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Attribute &quot;unique&quot; is
deprecated</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(D deprecated) You have used
the attributes pragma to modify the &quot;unique&quot;
attribute on an array, hash or scalar reference. The :unique
attribute has had no effect since Perl 5.8.8, and will be
removed in a future release of Perl 5.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">av_reify called on tied
array</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S debugging) This indicates
that something went wrong and Perl got <i>very</i> confused
about <tt>@_</tt> or <tt>@DB::args</tt> being tied.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Bad arg length for %s, is %u,
should be %d</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You passed a buffer of the
wrong size to one of <i>msgctl()</i>, <i>semctl()</i> or
<i>shmctl()</i>. In C parlance, the correct sizes are,
respectively, sizeof(struct&nbsp;msqid_ds&nbsp;*),
sizeof(struct&nbsp;semid_ds&nbsp;*), and
sizeof(struct&nbsp;shmid_ds&nbsp;*).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Bad evalled substitution
pattern</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You&rsquo;ve used the
<tt>&quot;/e&quot;</tt> switch to evaluate the replacement
for a substitution, but perl found a syntax error in the
code to evaluate, most likely an unexpected right brace
&rsquo;}&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Bad filehandle: %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) A symbol was passed to
something wanting a filehandle, but the symbol has no
filehandle associated with it. Perhaps you didn&rsquo;t do
an <i>open()</i>, or did it in another package.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Bad <i>free()</i> ignored</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S malloc) An internal routine
called <i>free()</i> on something that had never been
<i>malloc()</i>ed in the first place. Mandatory, but can be
disabled by setting environment variable
<tt>&quot;PERL_BADFREE&quot;</tt> to 0.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This message
can be seen quite often with DB_File on systems with
&quot;hard&quot; dynamic linking, like
<tt>&quot;AIX&quot;</tt> and <tt>&quot;OS/2&quot;</tt>. It
is a bug of <tt>&quot;Berkeley DB&quot;</tt> which is left
unnoticed if <tt>&quot;DB&quot;</tt> uses <i>forgiving</i>
system <i>malloc()</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Bad hash</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) One of the internal hash
routines was passed a null <small>HV</small> pointer.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Badly placed ()&rsquo;s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(A) You&rsquo;ve accidentally
run your script through <b>csh</b> instead of Perl. Check
the #! line, or manually feed your script into Perl
yourself.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Bad name after %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You started to name a
symbol by using a package prefix, and then didn&rsquo;t
finish the symbol. In particular, you can&rsquo;t
interpolate outside of quotes, so</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    $var = 'myvar';
    $sym = mypack::$var;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">is not the same
as</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    $var = 'myvar';
    $sym = &quot;mypack::$var&quot;;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%;">Bad plugin affecting keyword
&rsquo;%s&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) An extension using the
keyword plugin mechanism violated the plugin
<small>API</small> .</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Bad <i>realloc()</i>
ignored</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S malloc) An internal routine
called <i>realloc()</i> on something that had never been
<i>malloc()</i>ed in the first place. Mandatory, but can be
disabled by setting the environment variable
<tt>&quot;PERL_BADFREE&quot;</tt> to 1.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Bad symbol for array</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) An internal request asked
to add an array entry to something that wasn&rsquo;t a
symbol table entry.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Bad symbol for dirhandle</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) An internal request asked
to add a dirhandle entry to something that wasn&rsquo;t a
symbol table entry.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Bad symbol for filehandle</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) An internal request asked
to add a filehandle entry to something that wasn&rsquo;t a
symbol table entry.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Bad symbol for hash</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) An internal request asked
to add a hash entry to something that wasn&rsquo;t a symbol
table entry.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Bareword found in
conditional</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W bareword) The compiler found
a bareword where it expected a conditional, which often
indicates that an || or &amp;&amp; was parsed as part of the
last argument of the previous construct, for example:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    open FOO || die;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">It may also
indicate a misspelled constant that has been interpreted as
a bareword:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    use constant TYPO =&gt; 1;
    if (TYOP) { print &quot;foo&quot; }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The
<tt>&quot;strict&quot;</tt> pragma is useful in avoiding
such errors.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Bareword &quot;%s&quot; not
allowed while &quot;strict subs&quot; in use</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) With &quot;strict
subs&quot; in use, a bareword is only allowed as a
subroutine identifier, in curly brackets or to the left of
the &quot;=&gt;&quot; symbol. Perhaps you need to predeclare
a subroutine?</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Bareword &quot;%s&quot; refers
to nonexistent package</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W bareword) You used a
qualified bareword of the form <tt>&quot;Foo::&quot;</tt>,
but the compiler saw no other uses of that namespace before
that point. Perhaps you need to predeclare a package?</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><small>BEGIN</small>
failed--compilation aborted</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) An untrapped exception was
raised while executing a <small>BEGIN</small> subroutine.
Compilation stops immediately and the interpreter is
exited.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><small>BEGIN</small> not safe
after errors--compilation aborted</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Perl found a
<tt>&quot;BEGIN {}&quot;</tt> subroutine (or a
<tt>&quot;use&quot;</tt> directive, which implies a
<tt>&quot;BEGIN {}&quot;</tt>) after one or more compilation
errors had already occurred. Since the intended environment
for the <tt>&quot;BEGIN {}&quot;</tt> could not be
guaranteed (due to the errors), and since subsequent code
likely depends on its correct operation, Perl just gave
up.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">\1 better written as $1</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W syntax) Outside of patterns,
backreferences live on as variables. The use of backslashes
is grandfathered on the right-hand side of a substitution,
but stylistically it&rsquo;s better to use the variable form
because other Perl programmers will expect it, and it works
better if there are more than 9 backreferences.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Binary number &gt;
0b11111111111111111111111111111111 non-portable</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W portable) The binary number
you specified is larger than 2**32&minus;1 (4294967295) and
therefore non-portable between systems. See perlport for
more on portability concerns.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>bind()</i> on closed socket
%s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W closed) You tried to do a
bind on a closed socket. Did you forget to check the return
value of your <i>socket()</i> call? See &quot;bind&quot; in
perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>binmode()</i> on closed
filehandle %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W unopened) You tried
<i>binmode()</i> on a filehandle that was never opened.
Check your control flow and number of arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot;\b{&quot; is deprecated;
use &quot;\b\{&quot; instead <br>
&quot;\B{&quot; is deprecated; use &quot;\B\{&quot;
instead</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W deprecated, regexp) Use of
an unescaped &quot;{&quot; immediately following a
<tt>&quot;\b&quot;</tt> or <tt>&quot;\B&quot;</tt> is now
deprecated so as to reserve its use for Perl itself in a
future release.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Bit vector size &gt; 32
non-portable</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W portable) Using bit vector
sizes larger than 32 is non-portable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Bizarre copy of %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) Perl detected an attempt to
copy an internal value that is not copiable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Buffer overflow in
prime_env_iter: %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W internal) A warning peculiar
to <small>VMS</small> . While Perl was preparing to iterate
over <tt>%ENV</tt>, it encountered a logical name or symbol
definition which was too long, so it was truncated to the
string shown.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Bizarre SvTYPE [%d]</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) When starting a new thread
or return values from a thread, Perl encountered an invalid
data type.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Callback called exit</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) A subroutine invoked from
an external package via <i>call_sv()</i> exited by calling
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">%s() called too early to check
prototype</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W prototype) You&rsquo;ve
called a function that has a prototype before the parser saw
a definition or declaration for it, and Perl could not check
that the call conforms to the prototype. You need to either
add an early prototype declaration for the subroutine in
question, or move the subroutine definition ahead of the
call to get proper prototype checking. Alternatively, if you
are certain that you&rsquo;re calling the function
correctly, you may put an ampersand before the name to avoid
the warning. See perlsub.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Cannot compress integer in
pack</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) An argument to
pack(&quot;w&quot;,...) was too large to compress. The
<small>BER</small> compressed integer format can only be
used with positive integers, and you attempted to compress
Infinity or a very large number (&gt; 1e308). See
&quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Cannot compress negative
numbers in pack</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) An argument to
pack(&quot;w&quot;,...) was negative. The <small>BER</small>
compressed integer format can only be used with positive
integers. See &quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Cannot convert a reference to
%s to typeglob</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You manipulated
Perl&rsquo;s symbol table directly, stored a reference in
it, then tried to access that symbol via conventional Perl
syntax. The access triggers Perl to autovivify that
typeglob, but it there is no legal conversion from that type
of reference to a typeglob.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Cannot copy to %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) Perl detected an attempt to
copy a value to an internal type that cannot be directly
assigned to.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Cannot find encoding
&quot;%s&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S io) You tried to apply an
encoding that did not exist to a filehandle, either with
<i>open()</i> or <i>binmode()</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Cannot set tied @DB::args</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) <tt>&quot;caller&quot;</tt>
tried to set <tt>@DB::args</tt>, but found it tied. Tying
<tt>@DB::args</tt> is not supported. (Before this error was
added, it used to crash.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Cannot tie unreifiable
array</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) You somehow managed to call
<tt>&quot;tie&quot;</tt> on an array that does not keep a
reference count on its arguments and cannot be made to do
so. Such arrays are not even supposed to be accessible to
Perl code, but are only used internally.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can only compress unsigned
integers in pack</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) An argument to
pack(&quot;w&quot;,...) was not an integer. The
<small>BER</small> compressed integer format can only be
used with positive integers, and you attempted to compress
something else. See &quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t bless non-reference
value</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Only hard references may be
blessed. This is how Perl &quot;enforces&quot; encapsulation
of objects. See perlobj.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t &quot;break&quot;
in a loop topicalizer</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You called
<tt>&quot;break&quot;</tt>, but you&rsquo;re in a
<tt>&quot;foreach&quot;</tt> block rather than a
<tt>&quot;given&quot;</tt> block. You probably meant to use
<tt>&quot;next&quot;</tt> or <tt>&quot;last&quot;</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t &quot;break&quot;
outside a given block</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You called
<tt>&quot;break&quot;</tt>, but you&rsquo;re not inside a
<tt>&quot;given&quot;</tt> block.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t call method
&quot;%s&quot; on an undefined value</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You used the syntax of a
method call, but the slot filled by the object reference or
package name contains an undefined value. Something like
this will reproduce the error:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    $BADREF = undef;
    process $BADREF 1,2,3;
    $BADREF&minus;&gt;process(1,2,3);</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t call method
&quot;%s&quot; on unblessed reference</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) A method call must know in
what package it&rsquo;s supposed to run. It ordinarily finds
this out from the object reference you supply, but you
didn&rsquo;t supply an object reference in this case. A
reference isn&rsquo;t an object reference until it has been
blessed. See perlobj.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t call method
&quot;%s&quot; without a package or object reference</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You used the syntax of a
method call, but the slot filled by the object reference or
package name contains an expression that returns a defined
value which is neither an object reference nor a package
name. Something like this will reproduce the error:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    $BADREF = 42;
    process $BADREF 1,2,3;
    $BADREF&minus;&gt;process(1,2,3);</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t chdir to %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You called <tt>&quot;perl
&minus;x/foo/bar&quot;</tt>, but
<tt>&quot;/foo/bar&quot;</tt> is not a directory that you
can chdir to, possibly because it doesn&rsquo;t exist.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t check filesystem of
script &quot;%s&quot; for nosuid</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) For some reason you
can&rsquo;t check the filesystem of the script for
nosuid.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t coerce %s to %s in
%s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Certain types of SVs, in
particular real symbol table entries (typeglobs),
can&rsquo;t be forced to stop being what they are. So you
can&rsquo;t say things like:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    *foo += 1;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">You
<small>CAN</small> say</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    $foo = *foo;
    $foo += 1;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">but then
<tt>$foo</tt> no longer contains a glob.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t
&quot;continue&quot; outside a when block</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You called
<tt>&quot;continue&quot;</tt>, but you&rsquo;re not inside a
<tt>&quot;when&quot;</tt> or <tt>&quot;default&quot;</tt>
block.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t create pipe
mailbox</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) An error peculiar to
<small>VMS</small> . The process is suffering from exhausted
quotas or other plumbing problems.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t declare %s in
&quot;%s&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Only scalar, array, and
hash variables may be declared as &quot;my&quot;,
&quot;our&quot; or &quot;state&quot; variables. They must
have ordinary identifiers as names.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t &quot;default&quot;
outside a topicalizer</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You have used a
<tt>&quot;default&quot;</tt> block that is neither inside a
<tt>&quot;foreach&quot;</tt> loop nor a
<tt>&quot;given&quot;</tt> block. (Note that this error is
issued on exit from the <tt>&quot;default&quot;</tt> block,
so you won&rsquo;t get the error if you use an explicit
<tt>&quot;continue&quot;</tt>.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t do inplace edit: %s
is not a regular file</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S inplace) You tried to use
the <b>&minus;i</b> switch on a special file, such as a file
in /dev, or a <small>FIFO</small> . The file was
ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t do inplace edit on
%s: %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S inplace) The creation of the
new file failed for the indicated reason.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t do inplace edit
without backup</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You&rsquo;re on a system
such as MS-DOS that gets confused if you try reading from a
deleted (but still opened) file. You have to say
<tt>&quot;&minus;i.bak&quot;</tt>, or some such.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t do inplace edit: %s
would not be unique</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S inplace) Your filesystem
does not support filenames longer than 14 characters and
Perl was unable to create a unique filename during inplace
editing with the <b>&minus;i</b> switch. The file was
ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t do {n,m} with n
&gt; m in regex; marked by &lt;&minus;&minus;
<small>HERE</small> in m/%s/</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Minima must be less than or
equal to maxima. If you really want your regexp to match
something 0 times, just put {0}. The &lt;&minus;&minus;
<small>HERE</small> shows in the regular expression about
where the problem was discovered. See perlre.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t do waitpid with
flags</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) This machine doesn&rsquo;t
have either <i>waitpid()</i> or <i>wait4()</i>, so only
<i>waitpid()</i> without flags is emulated.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t emulate &minus;%s
on #! line</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The #! line specifies a
switch that doesn&rsquo;t make sense at this point. For
example, it&rsquo;d be kind of silly to put a
<b>&minus;x</b> on the #! line.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t %s %s&minus;endian
%ss on this platform</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Your platform&rsquo;s
byte-order is neither big-endian nor little-endian, or it
has a very strange pointer size. Packing and unpacking
big&minus; or little-endian floating point values and
pointers may not be possible. See &quot;pack&quot; in
perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t exec
&quot;%s&quot;: %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W exec) A <i>system()</i>,
<i>exec()</i>, or piped open call could not execute the
named program for the indicated reason. Typical reasons
include: the permissions were wrong on the file, the file
wasn&rsquo;t found in <tt>$ENV{PATH}</tt>, the executable in
question was compiled for another architecture, or the #!
line in a script points to an interpreter that can&rsquo;t
be run for similar reasons. (Or maybe your system
doesn&rsquo;t support #! at all.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t exec %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Perl was trying to execute
the indicated program for you because that&rsquo;s what the
#! line said. If that&rsquo;s not what you wanted, you may
need to mention &quot;perl&quot; on the #! line
somewhere.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t execute %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You used the
<b>&minus;S</b> switch, but the copies of the script to
execute found in the <small>PATH</small> did not have
correct permissions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t find an opnumber
for &quot;%s&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) A string of a form
<tt>&quot;CORE::word&quot;</tt> was given to
<i>prototype()</i>, but there is no builtin with the name
<tt>&quot;word&quot;</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t find %s character
property &quot;%s&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You used
<tt>&quot;\p{}&quot;</tt> or <tt>&quot;\P{}&quot;</tt> but
the character property by that name could not be found.
Maybe you misspelled the name of the property? See
&quot;Properties accessible through \p{} and \P{}&quot; in
perluniprops for a complete list of available
properties.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t find label %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You said to goto a label
that isn&rsquo;t mentioned anywhere that it&rsquo;s possible
for us to go to. See &quot;goto&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t find %s on
<small>PATH</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You used the
<b>&minus;S</b> switch, but the script to execute could not
be found in the <small>PATH</small> .</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t find %s on
<small>PATH</small> , &rsquo;.&rsquo; not in
<small>PATH</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You used the
<b>&minus;S</b> switch, but the script to execute could not
be found in the <small>PATH</small> , or at least not with
the correct permissions. The script exists in the current
directory, but <small>PATH</small> prohibits running it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t find string
terminator %s anywhere before <small>EOF</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Perl strings can stretch
over multiple lines. This message means that the closing
delimiter was omitted. Because bracketed quotes count
nesting levels, the following is missing its final
parenthesis:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    print q(The character '(' starts a side comment.);</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If you&rsquo;re
getting this error from a here-document, you may have
included unseen whitespace before or after your closing tag
or there may not be a linebreak after it. A good
programmer&rsquo;s editor will have a way to help you find
these characters (or lack of characters). See perlop for the
full details on here-documents.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t find Unicode
property definition &quot;%s&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You may have tried to use
<tt>&quot;\p&quot;</tt> which means a Unicode property (for
example <tt>&quot;\p{Lu}&quot;</tt> matches all uppercase
letters). If you did mean to use a Unicode property, see
&quot;Properties accessible through \p{} and \P{}&quot; in
perluniprops for a complete list of available properties. If
you didn&rsquo;t mean to use a Unicode property, escape the
<tt>&quot;\p&quot;</tt>, either by <tt>&quot;\\p&quot;</tt>
(just the <tt>&quot;\p&quot;</tt>) or by
<tt>&quot;\Q\p&quot;</tt> (the rest of the string, or until
<tt>&quot;\E&quot;</tt>).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t fork: %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) A fatal error occurred
while trying to fork while opening a pipeline.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t fork, trying again
in 5 seconds</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W pipe) A fork in a piped open
failed with <small>EAGAIN</small> and will be retried after
five seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t get filespec
&minus; stale stat buffer?</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S) A warning peculiar to
<small>VMS</small> . This arises because of the difference
between access checks under <small>VMS</small> and under the
Unix model Perl assumes. Under <small>VMS</small> , access
checks are done by filename, rather than by bits in the stat
buffer, so that ACLs and other protections can be taken into
account. Unfortunately, Perl assumes that the stat buffer
contains all the necessary information, and passes it,
instead of the filespec, to the access-checking routine. It
will try to retrieve the filespec using the device name and
<small>FID</small> present in the stat buffer, but this
works only if you haven&rsquo;t made a subsequent call to
the <small>CRTL</small> <i>stat()</i> routine, because the
device name is overwritten with each call. If this warning
appears, the name lookup failed, and the access-checking
routine gave up and returned <small>FALSE</small> , just to
be conservative. (Note: The access-checking routine knows
about the Perl <tt>&quot;stat&quot;</tt> operator and file
tests, so you shouldn&rsquo;t ever see this warning in
response to a Perl command; it arises only if some internal
code takes stat buffers lightly.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t get pipe mailbox
device name</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) An error peculiar to
<small>VMS</small> . After creating a mailbox to act as a
pipe, Perl can&rsquo;t retrieve its name for later use.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t get
<small>SYSGEN</small> parameter value for
<small>MAXBUF</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) An error peculiar to
<small>VMS</small> . Perl asked <tt>$GETSYI</tt> how big you
want your mailbox buffers to be, and didn&rsquo;t get an
answer.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t &quot;goto&quot;
into the middle of a foreach loop</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) A &quot;goto&quot;
statement was executed to jump into the middle of a foreach
loop. You can&rsquo;t get there from here. See
&quot;goto&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t &quot;goto&quot;
out of a pseudo block</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) A &quot;goto&quot;
statement was executed to jump out of what might look like a
block, except that it isn&rsquo;t a proper block. This
usually occurs if you tried to jump out of a <i>sort()</i>
block or subroutine, which is a no-no. See &quot;goto&quot;
in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t goto subroutine
from a sort sub (or similar callback)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The &quot;goto
subroutine&quot; call can&rsquo;t be used to jump out of the
comparison sub for a <i>sort()</i>, or from a similar
callback (such as the <i>reduce()</i> function in
List::Util).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t goto subroutine
from an eval&minus;%s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The &quot;goto
subroutine&quot; call can&rsquo;t be used to jump out of an
eval &quot;string&quot; or block.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t goto subroutine
outside a subroutine</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The deeply magical
&quot;goto subroutine&quot; call can only replace one
subroutine call for another. It can&rsquo;t manufacture one
out of whole cloth. In general you should be calling it out
of only an <small>AUTOLOAD</small> routine anyway. See
&quot;goto&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t ignore signal
<small>CHLD</small> , forcing to default</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W signal) Perl has detected
that it is being run with the <small>SIGCHLD</small> signal
(sometimes known as <small>SIGCLD</small> ) disabled. Since
disabling this signal will interfere with proper
determination of exit status of child processes, Perl has
reset the signal to its default value. This situation
typically indicates that the parent program under which Perl
may be running (e.g. cron) is being very careless.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t kill a non-numeric
process <small>ID</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Process identifiers must be
(signed) integers. It is a fatal error to attempt to
<i>kill()</i> an undefined, empty-string or otherwise
non-numeric process identifier.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t &quot;last&quot;
outside a loop block</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) A &quot;last&quot;
statement was executed to break out of the current block,
except that there&rsquo;s this itty bitty problem called
there isn&rsquo;t a current block. Note that an
&quot;if&quot; or &quot;else&quot; block doesn&rsquo;t count
as a &quot;loopish&quot; block, as doesn&rsquo;t a block
given to <i>sort()</i>, <i>map()</i> or <i>grep()</i>. You
can usually double the curlies to get the same effect
though, because the inner curlies will be considered a block
that loops once. See &quot;last&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t linearize anonymous
symbol table</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Perl tried to calculate the
method resolution order ( <small>MRO</small> ) of a package,
but failed because the package stash has no name.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t load
&rsquo;%s&rsquo; for module %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The module you tried to
load failed to load a dynamic extension. This may either
mean that you upgraded your version of perl to one that is
incompatible with your old dynamic extensions (which is
known to happen between major versions of perl), or (more
likely) that your dynamic extension was built against an
older version of the library that is installed on your
system. You may need to rebuild your old dynamic
extensions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t localize lexical
variable %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You used local on a
variable name that was previously declared as a lexical
variable using &quot;my&quot; or &quot;state&quot;. This is
not allowed. If you want to localize a package variable of
the same name, qualify it with the package name.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t localize through a
reference</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You said something like
<tt>&quot;local $$ref&quot;</tt>, which Perl can&rsquo;t
currently handle, because when it goes to restore the old
value of whatever <tt>$ref</tt> pointed to after the scope
of the <i>local()</i> is finished, it can&rsquo;t be sure
that <tt>$ref</tt> will still be a reference.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t locate %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You said to
<tt>&quot;do&quot;</tt> (or <tt>&quot;require&quot;</tt>, or
<tt>&quot;use&quot;</tt>) a file that couldn&rsquo;t be
found. Perl looks for the file in all the locations
mentioned in <tt>@INC</tt>, unless the file name included
the full path to the file. Perhaps you need to set the
<small>PERL5LIB</small> or <small>PERL5OPT</small>
environment variable to say where the extra library is, or
maybe the script needs to add the library name to
<tt>@INC</tt>. Or maybe you just misspelled the name of the
file. See &quot;require&quot; in perlfunc and lib.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t locate auto/%s.al
in @INC</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) A function (or method) was
called in a package which allows autoload, but there is no
function to autoload. Most probable causes are a misprint in
a function/method name or a failure to
<tt>&quot;AutoSplit&quot;</tt> the file, say, by doing
<tt>&quot;make install&quot;</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t locate loadable
object for module %s in @INC</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The module you loaded is
trying to load an external library, like for example,
<i>foo.so</i> or <i>bar.dll</i>, but the DynaLoader module
was unable to locate this library. See DynaLoader.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t locate object
method &quot;%s&quot; via package &quot;%s&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You called a method
correctly, and it correctly indicated a package functioning
as a class, but that package doesn&rsquo;t define that
particular method, nor does any of its base classes. See
perlobj.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t locate package %s
for @%s::ISA</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W syntax) The <tt>@ISA</tt>
array contained the name of another package that
doesn&rsquo;t seem to exist.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t locate PerlIO%s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You tried to use in
<i>open()</i> a PerlIO layer that does not exist, e.g. open(
<small>FH</small> , &quot;&gt;:nosuchlayer&quot;,
&quot;somefile&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t make list
assignment to %ENV on this system</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) List assignment to
<tt>%ENV</tt> is not supported on some systems, notably
<small>VMS</small> .</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t modify %s in %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You aren&rsquo;t allowed to
assign to the item indicated, or otherwise try to change it,
such as with an auto-increment.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t modify nonexistent
substring</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) The internal routine that
does assignment to a <i>substr()</i> was handed a
<small>NULL</small> .</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t modify non-lvalue
subroutine call</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Subroutines meant to be
used in lvalue context should be declared as such. See
&quot;Lvalue subroutines&quot; in perlsub.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t msgrcv to read-only
var</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The target of a msgrcv must
be modifiable to be used as a receive buffer.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t &quot;next&quot;
outside a loop block</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) A &quot;next&quot;
statement was executed to reiterate the current block, but
there isn&rsquo;t a current block. Note that an
&quot;if&quot; or &quot;else&quot; block doesn&rsquo;t count
as a &quot;loopish&quot; block, as doesn&rsquo;t a block
given to <i>sort()</i>, <i>map()</i> or <i>grep()</i>. You
can usually double the curlies to get the same effect
though, because the inner curlies will be considered a block
that loops once. See &quot;next&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t open %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You tried to run a perl
built with <small>MAD</small> support with the
<small>PERL_XMLDUMP</small> environment variable set, but
the file named by that variable could not be opened.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t open %s: %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S inplace) The implicit
opening of a file through use of the
<tt>&quot;&lt;&gt;&quot;</tt> filehandle, either implicitly
under the <tt>&quot;&minus;n&quot;</tt> or
<tt>&quot;&minus;p&quot;</tt> command-line switches, or
explicitly, failed for the indicated reason. Usually this is
because you don&rsquo;t have read permission for a file
which you named on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">(F) You tried
to call perl with the <b>&minus;e</b> switch, but
<i>/dev/null</i> (or your operating system&rsquo;s
equivalent) could not be opened.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t open a
reference</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W io) You tried to open a
scalar reference for reading or writing, using the
3&minus;arg <i>open()</i> syntax:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    open FH, '&gt;', $ref;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">but your
version of perl is compiled without perlio, and this form of
open is not supported.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t open bidirectional
pipe</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W pipe) You tried to say
<tt>&quot;open(CMD, &quot;|cmd|&quot;)&quot;</tt>, which is
not supported. You can try any of several modules in the
Perl library to do this, such as IPC::Open2. Alternately,
direct the pipe&rsquo;s output to a file using
&quot;&gt;&quot;, and then read it in under a different file
handle.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t open error file %s
as stderr</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) An error peculiar to
<small>VMS</small> . Perl does its own command line
redirection, and couldn&rsquo;t open the file specified
after &rsquo;2&gt;&rsquo; or &rsquo;2&gt;&gt;&rsquo; on the
command line for writing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t open input file %s
as stdin</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) An error peculiar to
<small>VMS</small> . Perl does its own command line
redirection, and couldn&rsquo;t open the file specified
after &rsquo;&lt;&rsquo; on the command line for
reading.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t open output file %s
as stdout</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) An error peculiar to
<small>VMS</small> . Perl does its own command line
redirection, and couldn&rsquo;t open the file specified
after &rsquo;&gt;&rsquo; or &rsquo;&gt;&gt;&rsquo; on the
command line for writing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t open output pipe
(name: %s)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) An error peculiar to
<small>VMS</small> . Perl does its own command line
redirection, and couldn&rsquo;t open the pipe into which to
send data destined for stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t open perl script
&quot;%s&quot;: %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The script you specified
can&rsquo;t be opened for the indicated reason.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If you&rsquo;re
debugging a script that uses #!, and normally relies on the
shell&rsquo;s <tt>$PATH</tt> search, the &minus;S option
causes perl to do that search, so you don&rsquo;t have to
type the path or <tt>&quot;`which
$scriptname`&quot;</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t read
<small>CRTL</small> environ</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S) A warning peculiar to
<small>VMS</small> . Perl tried to read an element of
<tt>%ENV</tt> from the <small>CRTL</small> &rsquo;s internal
environment array and discovered the array was missing. You
need to figure out where your <small>CRTL</small> misplaced
its environ or define <i><small>PERL_ENV_TABLES</small></i>
(see perlvms) so that environ is not searched.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t &quot;redo&quot;
outside a loop block</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) A &quot;redo&quot;
statement was executed to restart the current block, but
there isn&rsquo;t a current block. Note that an
&quot;if&quot; or &quot;else&quot; block doesn&rsquo;t count
as a &quot;loopish&quot; block, as doesn&rsquo;t a block
given to <i>sort()</i>, <i>map()</i> or <i>grep()</i>. You
can usually double the curlies to get the same effect
though, because the inner curlies will be considered a block
that loops once. See &quot;redo&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t remove %s: %s,
skipping file</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S inplace) You requested an
inplace edit without creating a backup file. Perl was unable
to remove the original file to replace it with the modified
file. The file was left unmodified.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t rename %s to %s:
%s, skipping file</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S inplace) The rename done by
the <b>&minus;i</b> switch failed for some reason, probably
because you don&rsquo;t have write permission to the
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t reopen input pipe
(name: %s) in binary mode</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) An error peculiar to
<small>VMS</small> . Perl thought stdin was a pipe, and
tried to reopen it to accept binary data. Alas, it
failed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t reset %ENV on this
system</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You called
<tt>&quot;reset('E')&quot;</tt> or similar, which tried to
reset all variables in the current package beginning with
&quot;E&quot;. In the main package, that includes
<tt>%ENV</tt>. Resetting <tt>%ENV</tt> is not supported on
some systems, notably <small>VMS</small> .</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t resolve method
&quot;%s&quot; overloading &quot;%s&quot; in package
&quot;%s&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F)(P) Error resolving
overloading specified by a method name (as opposed to a
subroutine reference): no such method callable via the
package. If the method name is <tt>&quot;???&quot;</tt>,
this is an internal error.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t return %s from
lvalue subroutine</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Perl detected an attempt to
return illegal lvalues (such as temporary or readonly
values) from a subroutine used as an lvalue. This is not
allowed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t return outside a
subroutine</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The return statement was
executed in mainline code, that is, where there was no
subroutine call to return out of. See perlsub.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t return %s to lvalue
scalar context</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You tried to return a
complete array or hash from an lvalue subroutine, but you
called the subroutine in a way that made Perl think you
meant to return only one value. You probably meant to write
parentheses around the call to the subroutine, which tell
Perl that the call should be in list context.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t stat script
&quot;%s&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) For some reason you
can&rsquo;t <i>fstat()</i> the script even though you have
it open already. Bizarre.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t take log of %g</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) For ordinary real numbers,
you can&rsquo;t take the logarithm of a negative number or
zero. There&rsquo;s a Math::Complex package that comes
standard with Perl, though, if you really want to do that
for the negative numbers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t take sqrt of %g</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) For ordinary real numbers,
you can&rsquo;t take the square root of a negative number.
There&rsquo;s a Math::Complex package that comes standard
with Perl, though, if you really want to do that.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t undef active
subroutine</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You can&rsquo;t undefine a
routine that&rsquo;s currently running. You can, however,
redefine it while it&rsquo;s running, and you can even undef
the redefined subroutine while the old routine is running.
Go figure.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t upgrade %s (%d) to
%d</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) The internal sv_upgrade
routine adds &quot;members&quot; to an <small>SV</small> ,
making it into a more specialized kind of <small>SV</small>
. The top several <small>SV</small> types are so
specialized, however, that they cannot be interconverted.
This message indicates that such a conversion was
attempted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t use
&rsquo;%c&rsquo; after &minus;mname</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You tried to call perl with
the <b>&minus;m</b> switch, but you put something other than
&quot;=&quot; after the module name.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t use anonymous
symbol table for method lookup</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The internal routine that
does method lookup was handed a symbol table that
doesn&rsquo;t have a name. Symbol tables can become
anonymous for example by undefining stashes: <tt>&quot;undef
%Some::Package::&quot;</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t use an undefined
value as %s reference</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) A value used as either a
hard reference or a symbolic reference must be a defined
value. This helps to delurk some insidious errors.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t use bareword
(&quot;%s&quot;) as %s ref while &quot;strict refs&quot; in
use</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Only hard references are
allowed by &quot;strict refs&quot;. Symbolic references are
disallowed. See perlref.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t use %! because
Errno.pm is not available</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The first time the
<tt>&quot;%!&quot;</tt> hash is used, perl automatically
loads the Errno.pm module. The Errno module is expected to
tie the %! hash to provide symbolic names for <tt>$!</tt>
errno values.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t use both
&rsquo;&lt;&rsquo; and &rsquo;&gt;&rsquo; after type
&rsquo;%c&rsquo; in %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) A type cannot be forced to
have both big-endian and little-endian byte-order at the
same time, so this combination of modifiers is not allowed.
See &quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t use %s for loop
variable</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Only a simple scalar
variable may be used as a loop variable on a foreach.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t use global %s in
&quot;%s&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You tried to declare a
magical variable as a lexical variable. This is not allowed,
because the magic can be tied to only one location (namely
the global variable) and it would be incredibly confusing to
have variables in your program that looked like magical
variables but weren&rsquo;t.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t use
&rsquo;%c&rsquo; in a group with different byte-order in
%s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You attempted to force a
different byte-order on a type that is already inside a
group with a byte-order modifier. For example you cannot
force little-endianness on a type that is inside a
big-endian group.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t use &quot;my
%s&quot; in sort comparison</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The global variables
<tt>$a</tt> and <tt>$b</tt> are reserved for sort
comparisons. You mentioned <tt>$a</tt> or <tt>$b</tt> in the
same line as the &lt;=&gt; or cmp operator, and the variable
had earlier been declared as a lexical variable. Either
qualify the sort variable with the package name, or rename
the lexical variable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t use %s ref as %s
ref</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You&rsquo;ve mixed up your
reference types. You have to dereference a reference of the
type needed. You can use the <i>ref()</i> function to test
the type of the reference, if need be.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t use string
(&quot;%s&quot;) as %s ref while &quot;strict refs&quot; in
use</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Only hard references are
allowed by &quot;strict refs&quot;. Symbolic references are
disallowed. See perlref.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t use subscript on
%s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The compiler tried to
interpret a bracketed expression as a subscript. But to the
left of the brackets was an expression that didn&rsquo;t
look like a hash or array reference, or anything else
subscriptable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t use \%c to mean $%c
in expression</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W syntax) In an ordinary
expression, backslash is a unary operator that creates a
reference to its argument. The use of backslash to indicate
a backreference to a matched substring is valid only as part
of a regular expression pattern. Trying to do this in
ordinary Perl code produces a value that prints out looking
like <i><small>SCALAR</small></i> (0xdecaf). Use the
<tt>$1</tt> form instead.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t weaken a
nonreference</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You attempted to weaken
something that was not a reference. Only references can be
weakened.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t &quot;when&quot;
outside a topicalizer</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You have used a
<i>when()</i> block that is neither inside a
<tt>&quot;foreach&quot;</tt> loop nor a
<tt>&quot;given&quot;</tt> block. (Note that this error is
issued on exit from the <tt>&quot;when&quot;</tt> block, so
you won&rsquo;t get the error if the match fails, or if you
use an explicit <tt>&quot;continue&quot;</tt>.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t x= to read-only
value</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You tried to repeat a
constant value (often the undefined value) with an
assignment operator, which implies modifying the value
itself. Perhaps you need to copy the value to a temporary,
and repeat that.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Character following
&quot;\c&quot; must be <small>ASCII</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F)(W deprecated, syntax) In
<tt>&quot;\c</tt><i>X</i><tt>&quot;</tt>, <i>X</i> must be
an <small>ASCII</small> character. It is planned to make
this fatal in all instances in Perl 5.18. In the cases where
it isn&rsquo;t fatal, the character this evaluates to is
derived by exclusive or&rsquo;ing the code point of this
character with 0x40.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
non-alphabetic <small>ASCII</small> characters are
discouraged here as well.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Character in &rsquo;C&rsquo;
format wrapped in pack</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W pack) You said</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    pack(&quot;C&quot;, $x)</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">where
<tt>$x</tt> is either less than 0 or more than 255; the
<tt>&quot;C&quot;</tt> format is only for encoding native
operating system characters ( <small>ASCII</small> ,
<small>EBCDIC</small> , and so on) and not for Unicode
characters, so Perl behaved as if you meant</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    pack(&quot;C&quot;, $x &amp; 255)</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If you actually
want to pack Unicode codepoints, use the
<tt>&quot;U&quot;</tt> format instead.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Character in &rsquo;W&rsquo;
format wrapped in pack</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W pack) You said</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    pack(&quot;U0W&quot;, $x)</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">where
<tt>$x</tt> is either less than 0 or more than 255. However,
<tt>&quot;U0&quot;</tt>&minus;mode expects all values to

the ability to specify a semi-colon this way in Perl 5.18.
Just use a semi-colon or a backslash-semi-colon without the

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Perl allows
strings to contain a superset of Unicode code points, up to
the limit of what is storable in an unsigned integer on your

immediately.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Complex regular subexpression
recursion limit (%d) exceeded</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W regexp) The regular
expression engine uses recursion in complex situations where
back-tracking is required. Recursion depth is limited to
32766, or perhaps less in architectures where the stack
cannot grow arbitrarily. (&quot;Simple&quot; and
&quot;medium&quot; situations are handled without recursion
and are not subject to a limit.) Try shortening the string
under examination; looping in Perl code (e.g. with
<tt>&quot;while&quot;</tt>) rather than in the regular
expression engine; or rewriting the regular expression so
that it is simpler or backtracks less. (See perlfaq2 for
information on <i>Mastering Regular Expressions</i>.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>cond_broadcast()</i> called
on unlocked variable</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W threads) Within a
thread-enabled program, you tried to call
<i>cond_broadcast()</i> on a variable which wasn&rsquo;t
locked. The <i>cond_broadcast()</i> function is used to wake
up another thread that is waiting in a <i>cond_wait()</i>.
To ensure that the signal isn&rsquo;t sent before the other
thread has a chance to enter the wait, it is usual for the
signaling thread first to wait for a lock on variable. This
lock attempt will only succeed after the other thread has
entered <i>cond_wait()</i> and thus relinquished the
lock.</p>

&quot;connect&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Constant(%s)%s: %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The parser found

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Constant is not %s
reference</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) A constant value (perhaps
declared using the <tt>&quot;use constant&quot;</tt> pragma)
is being dereferenced, but it amounts to the wrong type of
reference. The message indicates the type of reference that
was expected. This usually indicates a syntax error in
dereferencing the constant value. See &quot;Constant
Functions&quot; in perlsub and constant.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Constant subroutine %s

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Deep recursion on anonymous

Deep recursion on subroutine &quot;%s&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W recursion) This subroutine
has called itself (directly or indirectly) 100 times more
than it has returned. This probably indicates an infinite
recursion, unless you&rsquo;re writing strange benchmark
programs, in which case it indicates something else.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This threshold
can be changed from 100, by recompiling the <i>perl</i>
binary, setting the C pre-processor macro
<tt>&quot;PERL_SUB_DEPTH_WARN&quot;</tt> to the desired

<p style="margin-left:11%;">defined(@array) is
deprecated</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(D deprecated) <i>defined()</i>
is not usually useful on arrays because it checks for an
undefined <i>scalar</i> value. If you want to see if the
array is empty, just use <tt>&quot;if (@array) { # not empty

<p style="margin-left:11%;">defined(%hash) is
deprecated</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(D deprecated)
<tt>&quot;defined()&quot;</tt> is not usually right on
hashes and has been discouraged since 5.004.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Although
<tt>&quot;defined %hash&quot;</tt> is false on a plain
not-yet-used hash, it becomes true in several non-obvious
circumstances, including iterators, weak references, stash

%hash&quot;</tt>. These things make <tt>&quot;defined
%hash&quot;</tt> fairly useless in practice.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If a check for

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Deprecated use of <i>my()</i>
in false conditional</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(D deprecated) You used a
declaration similar to <tt>&quot;my $x if 0&quot;</tt>.
There has been a long-standing bug in Perl that causes a
lexical variable not to be cleared at scope exit when its
declaration includes a false conditional. Some people have
exploited this bug to achieve a kind of static variable.
Since we intend to fix this bug, we don&rsquo;t want people
relying on this behavior. You can achieve a similar static
effect by declaring the variable in a separate block outside
the function, eg</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    sub f { my $x if 0; return $x++ }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">becomes</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Beginning with
perl 5.9.4, you can also use <tt>&quot;state&quot;</tt>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) A <i><small>DESTROY</small>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">See Server error.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">%s did not return a true
value</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) A required (or used) file
must return a true value to indicate that it compiled
correctly and ran its initialization code correctly.
It&rsquo;s traditional to end such a file with a
&quot;1;&quot;, though any true value would do. See
&quot;require&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">(Did you mean &amp;%s

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W misc) You probably referred
to an imported subroutine &amp;FOO as <tt>$FOO</tt> or some
such.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">(Did you mean &quot;local&quot;
instead of &quot;our&quot;?)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W misc) Remember that
&quot;our&quot; does not localize the declared global
variable. You have declared it again in the same lexical
scope, which seems superfluous.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">(Did you mean $ or @ instead of
%?)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W) You probably said
<tt>%hash</tt>{$key} when you meant <tt>$hash</tt>{$key} or
<tt>@hash</tt>{@keys}. On the other hand, maybe you just
meant <tt>%hash</tt> and got carried away.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Died</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You passed <i>die()</i> an
empty string (the equivalent of <tt>&quot;die

<p style="margin-left:11%;">(Do you need to predeclare
%s?)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S syntax) This is an educated
guess made in conjunction with the message &quot;%s found
where operator expected&quot;. It often means a subroutine
or module name is being referenced that hasn&rsquo;t been
declared yet. This may be because of ordering problems in
your file, or because of a missing &quot;sub&quot;,
&quot;package&quot;, &quot;require&quot;, or &quot;use&quot;
statement. If you&rsquo;re referencing something that
isn&rsquo;t defined yet, you don&rsquo;t actually have to
define the subroutine or package before the current
location. You can use an empty &quot;sub foo;&quot; or
&quot;package <small>FOO</small> ;&quot; to enter a
&quot;forward&quot; declaration.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>dump()</i> better written as

<p style="margin-left:11%;">elseif should be elsif</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S syntax) There is no keyword
&quot;elseif&quot; in Perl because Larry thinks it&rsquo;s
ugly. Your code will be interpreted as an attempt to call a
method named &quot;elseif&quot; for the class returned by
the following block. This is unlikely to be what you

<p style="margin-left:11%;">%ENV is aliased to %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You&rsquo;re running under
taint mode, and the <tt>%ENV</tt> variable has been aliased
to another hash, so it doesn&rsquo;t reflect anymore the
state of the program&rsquo;s environment. This is
potentially insecure.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Error converting file
specification %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) An error peculiar to
<small>VMS</small> . Because Perl may have to deal with file
specifications in either <small>VMS</small> or Unix syntax,
it converts them to a single form when it must operate on
them directly. Either you&rsquo;ve passed an invalid file
specification to Perl, or you&rsquo;ve found a case the
conversion routines don&rsquo;t handle. Drat.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">%s: Eval-group in insecure
regular expression</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Perl detected tainted data
when trying to compile a regular expression that contains
the <tt>&quot;(?{ ... })&quot;</tt> zero-width assertion,
which is unsafe. See &quot;(?{ code })&quot; in perlre, and
perlsec.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">%s: Eval-group not allowed at

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Perl tried to compile a
regular expression containing the <tt>&quot;(?{ ...

when the pattern contains interpolated values. Since that is
a security risk, it is not allowed. If you insist, you may
still do this by using the <tt>&quot;re 'eval'&quot;</tt>
pragma or by explicitly building the pattern from an
interpolated string at run time and using that in an
<i>eval()</i>. See &quot;(?{ code })&quot; in perlre.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">%s: Eval-group not allowed, use
re &rsquo;eval&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) A regular expression
contained the <tt>&quot;(?{ ... })&quot;</tt> zero-width
assertion, but that construct is only allowed when the
<tt>&quot;use re 'eval'&quot;</tt> pragma is in effect. See
&quot;(?{ code })&quot; in perlre.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><small>EVAL</small> without pos
change exceeded limit in regex; marked by &lt;&minus;&minus;
<small>HERE</small> in <br>
m/%s/</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You used a pattern that
nested too many <small>EVAL</small> calls without consuming
any text. Restructure the pattern so that text is
consumed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The
&lt;&minus;&minus; <small>HERE</small> shows in the regular
expression about where the problem was discovered.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Excessively long &lt;&gt;
operator</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The contents of a &lt;&gt;
operator may not exceed the maximum size of a Perl
identifier. If you&rsquo;re just trying to glob a long list
of filenames, try using the <i>glob()</i> operator, or put
the filenames into a variable and glob that.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">exec? I&rsquo;m not *that* kind
of operating system</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The
<tt>&quot;exec&quot;</tt> function is not implemented on
some systems, e.g., Symbian <small>OS</small> . See
perlport.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Execution of %s aborted due to
compilation errors.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The final summary message
when a Perl compilation fails.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Exiting eval via %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W exiting) You are exiting an
eval by unconventional means, such as a goto, or a loop
control statement.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Exiting format via %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W exiting) You are exiting a
format by unconventional means, such as a goto, or a loop
control statement.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Exiting pseudo-block via %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W exiting) You are exiting a
rather special block construct (like a sort block or
subroutine) by unconventional means, such as a goto, or a
loop control statement. See &quot;sort&quot; in
perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Exiting subroutine via %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W exiting) You are exiting a
subroutine by unconventional means, such as a goto, or a
loop control statement.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Exiting substitution via %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W exiting) You are exiting a
substitution by unconventional means, such as a return, a
goto, or a loop control statement.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Explicit blessing to
&rsquo;&rsquo; (assuming package main)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W misc) You are blessing a
reference to a zero length string. This has the effect of
blessing the reference into the package main. This is
usually not what you want. Consider providing a default
target package, e.g. bless($ref, <tt>$p</tt> ||
&rsquo;MyPackage&rsquo;);</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">%s: Expression syntax</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(A) You&rsquo;ve accidentally
run your script through <b>csh</b> instead of Perl. Check
the #! line, or manually feed your script into Perl
yourself.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">%s failed--call queue
aborted</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) An untrapped exception was
raised while executing a <small>UNITCHECK</small> ,
<small>CHECK</small> , <small>INIT</small> , or
<small>END</small> subroutine. Processing of the remainder
of the queue of such routines has been prematurely
ended.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">False [] range &quot;%s&quot;
in regex; marked by &lt;&minus;&minus; <small>HERE</small>
in m/%s/</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W regexp) A character class
range must start and end at a literal character, not another
character class like <tt>&quot;\d&quot;</tt> or
<tt>&quot;[:alpha:]&quot;</tt>. The &quot;&minus;&quot; in
your false range is interpreted as a literal
&quot;&minus;&quot;. Consider quoting the
&quot;&minus;&quot;, &quot;\&minus;&quot;. The
&lt;&minus;&minus; <small>HERE</small> shows in the regular
expression about where the problem was discovered. See
perlre.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Fatal <small>VMS</small> error
(status=%d) at %s, line %d</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) An error peculiar to
<small>VMS</small> . Something untoward happened in a
<small>VMS</small> system service or <small>RTL</small>
routine; Perl&rsquo;s exit status should provide more
details. The filename in &quot;at <tt>%s</tt>&quot; and the
line number in &quot;line <tt>%d</tt>&quot; tell you which
section of the Perl source code is distressed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">fcntl is not implemented</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Your machine apparently
doesn&rsquo;t implement <i>fcntl()</i>. What is this, a
<small>PDP&minus;11</small> or something?</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><small>FETCHSIZE</small>
returned a negative value</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) A tied array claimed to
have a negative number of elements, which is not
possible.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Field too wide in
&rsquo;u&rsquo; format in pack</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W pack) Each line in an
uuencoded string start with a length indicator which
can&rsquo;t encode values above 63. So there is no point in
asking for a line length bigger than that. Perl will behave
as if you specified <tt>&quot;u63&quot;</tt> as the
format.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Filehandle %s opened only for
input</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W io) You tried to write on a
read-only filehandle. If you intended it to be a read-write
filehandle, you needed to open it with &quot;+&lt;&quot; or
&quot;+&gt;&quot; or &quot;+&gt;&gt;&quot; instead of with
&quot;&lt;&quot; or nothing. If you intended only to write
the file, use &quot;&gt;&quot; or &quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;. See
&quot;open&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Filehandle %s opened only for
output</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W io) You tried to read from a
filehandle opened only for writing, If you intended it to be
a read/write filehandle, you needed to open it with
&quot;+&lt;&quot; or &quot;+&gt;&quot; or
&quot;+&gt;&gt;&quot; instead of with &quot;&gt;&quot;. If
you intended only to read from the file, use
&quot;&lt;&quot;. See &quot;open&quot; in perlfunc. Another
possibility is that you attempted to open filedescriptor 0
(also known as <small>STDIN</small> ) for output (maybe you
closed <small>STDIN</small> earlier?).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Filehandle %s reopened as %s
only for input</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W io) You opened for reading a
filehandle that got the same filehandle id as
<small>STDOUT</small> or <small>STDERR</small> . This
occurred because you closed <small>STDOUT</small> or
<small>STDERR</small> previously.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Filehandle <small>STDIN</small>
reopened as %s only for output</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W io) You opened for writing a
filehandle that got the same filehandle id as
<small>STDIN</small> . This occurred because you closed
<small>STDIN</small> previously.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Final $ should be \$ or
$name</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You must now decide whether
the final $ in a string was meant to be a literal dollar
sign, or was meant to introduce a variable name that happens
to be missing. So you have to put either the backslash or
the name.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>flock()</i> on closed
filehandle %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W closed) The filehandle
you&rsquo;re attempting to <i>flock()</i> got itself closed
some time before now. Check your control flow.
<i>flock()</i> operates on filehandles. Are you attempting
to call <i>flock()</i> on a dirhandle by the same name?</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Format not terminated</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) A format must be terminated
by a line with a solitary dot. Perl got to the end of your
file without finding such a line.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Format %s redefined</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W redefine) You redefined a
format. To suppress this warning, say</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    {
        no warnings 'redefine';
        eval &quot;format NAME =...&quot;;
    }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%;">Found = in conditional, should
be ==</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W syntax) You said</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    if ($foo = 123)</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">when you
meant</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    if ($foo == 123)</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">(or something
like that).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">%s found where operator
expected</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S syntax) The Perl lexer knows
whether to expect a term or an operator. If it sees what it
knows to be a term when it was expecting to see an operator,
it gives you this warning. Usually it indicates that an
operator or delimiter was omitted, such as a semicolon.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">gdbm store returned %d, errno
%d, key &quot;%s&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S) A warning from the
GDBM_File extension that a store failed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">gethostent not implemented</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Your C library apparently
doesn&rsquo;t implement <i>gethostent()</i>, probably
because if it did, it&rsquo;d feel morally obligated to
return every hostname on the Internet.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">get%<i>sname()</i> on closed
socket %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W closed) You tried to get a
socket or peer socket name on a closed socket. Did you
forget to check the return value of your <i>socket()</i>
call?</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">getpwnam returned invalid
<small>UIC</small> %#o for user &quot;%s&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S) A warning peculiar to
<small>VMS</small> . The call to
<tt>&quot;sys$getuai&quot;</tt> underlying the
<tt>&quot;getpwnam&quot;</tt> operator returned an invalid
<small>UIC</small> .</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>getsockopt()</i> on closed
socket %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W closed) You tried to get a
socket option on a closed socket. Did you forget to check
the return value of your <i>socket()</i> call? See
&quot;getsockopt&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Global symbol &quot;%s&quot;
requires explicit package name</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You&rsquo;ve said &quot;use
strict&quot; or &quot;use strict vars&quot;, which indicates
that all variables must either be lexically scoped (using
&quot;my&quot; or &quot;state&quot;), declared beforehand
using &quot;our&quot;, or explicitly qualified to say which
package the global variable is in (using
&quot;::&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">glob failed (%s)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S glob) Something went wrong
with the external program(s) used for
<tt>&quot;glob&quot;</tt> and
<tt>&quot;&lt;*.c&gt;&quot;</tt>. Usually, this means that
you supplied a <tt>&quot;glob&quot;</tt> pattern that caused
the external program to fail and exit with a nonzero status.
If the message indicates that the abnormal exit resulted in
a coredump, this may also mean that your csh (C shell) is
broken. If so, you should change all of the csh-related
variables in config.sh: If you have tcsh, make the variables
refer to it as if it were csh (e.g.
<tt>&quot;full_csh='/usr/bin/tcsh'&quot;</tt>); otherwise,
make them all empty (except that <tt>&quot;d_csh&quot;</tt>
should be <tt>'undef'</tt>) so that Perl will think csh is
missing. In either case, after editing config.sh, run
<tt>&quot;./Configure &minus;S&quot;</tt> and rebuild
Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Glob not terminated</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The lexer saw a left angle
bracket in a place where it was expecting a term, so
it&rsquo;s looking for the corresponding right angle
bracket, and not finding it. Chances are you left some
needed parentheses out earlier in the line, and you really
meant a &quot;less than&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">gmtime(%f) too large</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W overflow) You called
<tt>&quot;gmtime&quot;</tt> with a number that was larger
than it can reliably handle and <tt>&quot;gmtime&quot;</tt>
probably returned the wrong date. This warning is also
triggered with NaN (the special not-a-number value).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">gmtime(%f) too small</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W overflow) You called
<tt>&quot;gmtime&quot;</tt> with a number that was smaller
than it can reliably handle and <tt>&quot;gmtime&quot;</tt>
probably returned the wrong date.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Got an error from
DosAllocMem</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) An error peculiar to
<small>OS/2</small> . Most probably you&rsquo;re using an
obsolete version of Perl, and this should not happen
anyway.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">goto must have label</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Unlike with
&quot;next&quot; or &quot;last&quot;, you&rsquo;re not
allowed to goto an unspecified destination. See
&quot;goto&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Goto undefined subroutine%s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You tried to call a
subroutine with <tt>&quot;goto &amp;sub&quot;</tt> syntax,
but the indicated subroutine hasn&rsquo;t been defined, or
if it was, it has since been undefined.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">()&minus;group starts with a
count</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) A ()&minus;group started
with a count. A count is supposed to follow something: a
template character or a ()&minus;group. See &quot;pack&quot;
in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">%s had compilation errors.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The final summary message
when a <tt>&quot;perl &minus;c&quot;</tt> fails.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Had to create %s
unexpectedly</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S internal) A routine asked
for a symbol from a symbol table that ought to have existed
already, but for some reason it didn&rsquo;t, and had to be
created on an emergency basis to prevent a core dump.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Hash %%s missing the % in
argument %d of %s()</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(D deprecated) Really old Perl
let you omit the % on hash names in some spots. This is now
heavily deprecated.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">%s has too many errors</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The parser has given up
trying to parse the program after 10 errors. Further error
messages would likely be uninformative.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Having no space between pattern
and following word is deprecated</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(D syntax)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">You had a word
that isn&rsquo;t a regex modifier immediately following a
pattern without an intervening space. If you are trying to
use the <tt>&quot;/le&quot;</tt> flags on a substitution,
use <tt>&quot;/el&quot;</tt> instead. Otherwise, add white
space between the pattern and following word to eliminate
the warning. As an example of the latter, the two
constructs:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"> $a =~ m/$foo/sand $bar
 $a =~ m/$foo/s and $bar</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">both currently
mean the same thing, but it is planned to disallow the first
form in Perl 5.18. And,</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"> $a =~ m/$foo/and $bar</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">will be
disallowed too.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Hexadecimal number &gt;
0xffffffff non-portable</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W portable) The hexadecimal
number you specified is larger than 2**32&minus;1
(4294967295) and therefore non-portable between systems. See
perlport for more on portability concerns.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Identifier too long</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Perl limits identifiers
(names for variables, functions, etc.) to about 250
characters for simple names, and somewhat more for compound
names (like <tt>$A::B</tt>). You&rsquo;ve exceeded
Perl&rsquo;s limits. Future versions of Perl are likely to
eliminate these arbitrary limitations.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Ignoring zero length \N{} in
character class</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W) Named Unicode character
escapes <tt>&quot;(\N{...})&quot;</tt> may return a
zero-length sequence. When such an escape is used in a
character class its behaviour is not well defined. Check
that the correct escape has been used, and the correct
charname handler is in scope.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Illegal binary digit %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You used a digit other than
0 or 1 in a binary number.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Illegal binary digit %s
ignored</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W digit) You may have tried to
use a digit other than 0 or 1 in a binary number.
Interpretation of the binary number stopped before the
offending digit.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Illegal character after
&rsquo;_&rsquo; in prototype for %s : %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W illegalproto) An illegal
character was found in a prototype declaration. Legal
characters in prototypes are $, @, %, *, ;, [, ], &amp;, \,
and +.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Illegal character \%o (carriage
return)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Perl normally treats
carriage returns in the program text as it would any other
whitespace, which means you should never see this error when
Perl was built using standard options. For some reason, your
version of Perl appears to have been built without this
support. Talk to your Perl administrator.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Illegal character in prototype
for %s : %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W illegalproto) An illegal
character was found in a prototype declaration. Legal
characters in prototypes are $, @, %, *, ;, [, ], &amp;, \,
and +.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Illegal declaration of
anonymous subroutine</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) When using the
<tt>&quot;sub&quot;</tt> keyword to construct an anonymous
subroutine, you must always specify a block of code. See
perlsub.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Illegal declaration of
subroutine %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) A subroutine was not
declared correctly. See perlsub.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Illegal division by zero</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You tried to divide a
number by 0. Either something was wrong in your logic, or
you need to put a conditional in to guard against
meaningless input.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Illegal hexadecimal digit %s
ignored</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W digit) You may have tried to
use a character other than 0 &minus; 9 or A &minus; F, a
&minus; f in a hexadecimal number. Interpretation of the
hexadecimal number stopped before the illegal character.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Illegal modulus zero</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You tried to divide a
number by 0 to get the remainder. Most numbers don&rsquo;t
take to this kindly.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Illegal number of bits in
vec</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The number of bits in
<i>vec()</i> (the third argument) must be a power of two
from 1 to 32 (or 64, if your platform supports that).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Illegal octal digit %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You used an 8 or 9 in an
octal number.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Illegal octal digit %s
ignored</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W digit) You may have tried to
use an 8 or 9 in an octal number. Interpretation of the
octal number stopped before the 8 or 9.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Illegal switch in
<small>PERL5OPT:</small> &minus;%c</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(X) The <small>PERL5OPT</small>
environment variable may only be used to set the following
switches: <b>&minus;[CDIMUdmtw]</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Ill-formed <small>CRTL</small>
environ value &quot;%s&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W internal) A warning peculiar
to <small>VMS</small> . Perl tried to read the
<small>CRTL</small> &rsquo;s internal environ array, and
encountered an element without the <tt>&quot;=&quot;</tt>
delimiter used to separate keys from values. The element is
ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Ill-formed message in
prime_env_iter: |%s|</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W internal) A warning peculiar
to <small>VMS</small> . Perl tried to read a logical name or
<small>CLI</small> symbol definition when preparing to
iterate over <tt>%ENV</tt>, and didn&rsquo;t see the
expected delimiter between key and value, so the line was
ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">(in cleanup) %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W misc) This prefix usually
indicates that a <i><small>DESTROY</small> ()</i> method
raised the indicated exception. Since destructors are
usually called by the system at arbitrary points during
execution, and often a vast number of times, the warning is
issued only once for any number of failures that would
otherwise result in the same message being repeated.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Failure of user
callbacks dispatched using the
<tt>&quot;G_KEEPERR&quot;</tt> flag could also result in
this warning. See &quot;G_KEEPERR&quot; in perlcall.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Inconsistent hierarchy during
C3 merge of class &rsquo;%s&rsquo;: merging failed on <br>
parent &rsquo;%s&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The method resolution order
( <small>MRO</small> ) of the given class is not
C3&minus;consistent, and you have enabled the C3
<small>MRO</small> for this class. See the C3 documentation
in mro for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">In <small>EBCDIC</small> the
v&minus;string components cannot exceed 2147483647</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) An error peculiar to
<small>EBCDIC</small> . Internally, v&minus;strings are
stored as Unicode code points, and encoded in
<small>EBCDIC</small> as UTF-EBCDIC. The UTF-EBCDIC encoding
is limited to code points no larger than 2147483647
(0x7FFFFFFF).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Infinite recursion in regex;
marked by &lt;&minus;&minus; <small>HERE</small> in
m/%s/</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You used a pattern that
references itself without consuming any input text. You
should check the pattern to ensure that recursive patterns
either consume text or fail.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The
&lt;&minus;&minus; <small>HERE</small> shows in the regular
expression about where the problem was discovered.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Initialization of state
variables in list context currently forbidden</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Currently the
implementation of &quot;state&quot; only permits the
initialization of scalar variables in scalar context.
Re-write <tt>&quot;state ($a) = 42&quot;</tt> as
<tt>&quot;state $a = 42&quot;</tt> to change from list to
scalar context. Constructions such as <tt>&quot;state (@a) =
foo()&quot;</tt> will be supported in a future perl
release.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Insecure dependency in %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You tried to do something
that the tainting mechanism didn&rsquo;t like. The tainting
mechanism is turned on when you&rsquo;re running setuid or
setgid, or when you specify <b>&minus;T</b> to turn it on
explicitly. The tainting mechanism labels all data
that&rsquo;s derived directly or indirectly from the user,
who is considered to be unworthy of your trust. If any such
data is used in a &quot;dangerous&quot; operation, you get
this error. See perlsec for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Insecure directory in %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You can&rsquo;t use
<i>system()</i>, <i>exec()</i>, or a piped open in a setuid
or setgid script if <tt>$ENV{PATH}</tt> contains a directory
that is writable by the world. Also, the <small>PATH</small>
must not contain any relative directory. See perlsec.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Insecure $ENV{%s} while running
%s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You can&rsquo;t use
<i>system()</i>, <i>exec()</i>, or a piped open in a setuid
or setgid script if any of <tt>$ENV{PATH}</tt>,
<tt>$ENV{IFS}</tt>, <tt>$ENV{CDPATH}</tt>,
<tt>$ENV{ENV}</tt>, <tt>$ENV{BASH_ENV}</tt> or
<tt>$ENV{TERM}</tt> are derived from data supplied (or
potentially supplied) by the user. The script must set the
path to a known value, using trustworthy data. See
perlsec.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Insecure user-defined property
%s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Perl detected tainted data
when trying to compile a regular expression that contains a
call to a user-defined character property function, i.e.
<tt>&quot;\p{IsFoo}&quot;</tt> or
<tt>&quot;\p{InFoo}&quot;</tt>. See &quot;User-Defined
Character Properties&quot; in perlunicode and perlsec.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Integer overflow in format
string for %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The indexes and widths
specified in the format string of
<tt>&quot;printf()&quot;</tt> or
<tt>&quot;sprintf()&quot;</tt> are too large. The numbers
must not overflow the size of integers for your
architecture.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Integer overflow in %s
number</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W overflow) The hexadecimal,
octal or binary number you have specified either as a
literal or as an argument to <i>hex()</i> or <i>oct()</i> is
too big for your architecture, and has been converted to a
floating point number. On a 32&minus;bit architecture the
largest hexadecimal, octal or binary number representable
without overflow is 0xFFFFFFFF, 037777777777, or
0b11111111111111111111111111111111 respectively. Note that
Perl transparently promotes all numbers to a floating point
representation internally--subject to loss of precision
errors in subsequent operations.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Integer overflow in version</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Some portion of a version
initialization is too large for the size of integers for
your architecture. This is not a warning because there is no
rational reason for a version to try and use a element
larger than typically 2**32. This is usually caused by
trying to use some odd mathematical operation as a version,
like 100/9.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Internal disaster in regex;
marked by &lt;&minus;&minus; <small>HERE</small> in
m/%s/</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) Something went badly wrong
in the regular expression parser. The &lt;&minus;&minus;
<small>HERE</small> shows in the regular expression about
where the problem was discovered.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Internal inconsistency in
tracking vforks</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S) A warning peculiar to
<small>VMS</small> . Perl keeps track of the number of times
you&rsquo;ve called <tt>&quot;fork&quot;</tt> and
<tt>&quot;exec&quot;</tt>, to determine whether the current
call to <tt>&quot;exec&quot;</tt> should affect the current
script or a subprocess (see &quot;exec <small>LIST</small>
&quot; in perlvms). Somehow, this count has become
scrambled, so Perl is making a guess and treating this
<tt>&quot;exec&quot;</tt> as a request to terminate the Perl
script and execute the specified command.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Internal urp in regex; marked
by &lt;&minus;&minus; <small>HERE</small> in m/%s/</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) Something went badly awry
in the regular expression parser. The &lt;&minus;&minus;
<small>HERE</small> shows in the regular expression about
where the problem was discovered.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">%s (...) interpreted as
function</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W syntax) You&rsquo;ve run
afoul of the rule that says that any list operator followed
by parentheses turns into a function, with all the list
operators arguments found inside the parentheses. See
&quot;Terms and List Operators (Leftward)&quot; in
perlop.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Invalid %s attribute: %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The indicated attribute for
a subroutine or variable was not recognized by Perl or by a
user-supplied handler. See attributes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Invalid %s attributes: %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The indicated attributes
for a subroutine or variable were not recognized by Perl or
by a user-supplied handler. See attributes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Invalid conversion in %s:
&quot;%s&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W printf) Perl does not
understand the given format conversion. See
&quot;sprintf&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Invalid escape in the specified
encoding in regex; marked by &lt;&minus;&minus;
<small>HERE</small> <br>
in m/%s/</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W regexp) The numeric escape
(for example <tt>&quot;\xHH&quot;</tt>) of value &lt; 256
didn&rsquo;t correspond to a single character through the
conversion from the encoding specified by the encoding
pragma. The escape was replaced with <small>REPLACEMENT
CHARACTER</small> (U+FFFD) instead. The &lt;&minus;&minus;
<small>HERE</small> shows in the regular expression about
where the escape was discovered.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Invalid hexadecimal number in
\N{U+...}</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The character constant
represented by <tt>&quot;...&quot;</tt> is not a valid
hexadecimal number. Either it is empty, or you tried to use
a character other than 0 &minus; 9 or A &minus; F, a &minus;
f in a hexadecimal number.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Invalid module name %s with
&minus;%c option: contains single &rsquo;:&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The module argument to
perl&rsquo;s <b>&minus;m</b> and <b>&minus;M</b>
command-line options cannot contain single colons in the
module name, but only in the arguments after &quot;=&quot;.
In other words, <b>&minus;MFoo::Bar=:baz</b> is ok, but
<b>&minus;MFoo:Bar=baz</b> is not.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Invalid mro name:
&rsquo;%s&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You tried to
<tt>&quot;mro::set_mro(&quot;classname&quot;,
&quot;foo&quot;)&quot;</tt> or <tt>&quot;use mro
'foo'&quot;</tt>, where <tt>&quot;foo&quot;</tt> is not a
valid method resolution order ( <small>MRO</small> ).
Currently, the only valid ones supported are
<tt>&quot;dfs&quot;</tt> and <tt>&quot;c3&quot;</tt>, unless
you have loaded a module that is a <small>MRO</small>
plugin. See mro and perlmroapi.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">invalid option &minus;D%c, use
&minus;D&rsquo;&rsquo; to see choices</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Perl was called with
invalid debugger flags. Call perl with the <b>&minus;D</b>
option with no flags to see the list of acceptable values.
See also &quot;<b>&minus;D</b><i>letters</i>&quot; in
perlrun.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Invalid [] range &quot;%s&quot;
in regex; marked by &lt;&minus;&minus; <small>HERE</small>
in m/%s/</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The range specified in a
character class had a minimum character greater than the
maximum character. One possibility is that you forgot the
<tt>&quot;{}&quot;</tt> from your ending
<tt>&quot;\x{}&quot;</tt> &minus; <tt>&quot;\x&quot;</tt>
without the curly braces can go only up to
<tt>&quot;ff&quot;</tt>. The &lt;&minus;&minus;
<small>HERE</small> shows in the regular expression about
where the problem was discovered. See perlre.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Invalid range &quot;%s&quot; in
transliteration operator</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The range specified in the
tr/// or y/// operator had a minimum character greater than
the maximum character. See perlop.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Invalid separator character %s
in attribute list</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Something other than a
colon or whitespace was seen between the elements of an
attribute list. If the previous attribute had a
parenthesised parameter list, perhaps that list was
terminated too soon. See attributes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Invalid separator character %s
in PerlIO layer specification %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W layer) When pushing layers
onto the Perl I/O system, something other than a colon or
whitespace was seen between the elements of a layer list. If
the previous attribute had a parenthesised parameter list,
perhaps that list was terminated too soon.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Invalid strict version format
(%s)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) A version number did not
meet the &quot;strict&quot; criteria for versions. A
&quot;strict&quot; version number is a positive decimal
number (integer or decimal-fraction) without exponentiation
or else a dotted-decimal v&minus;string with a leading
&rsquo;v&rsquo; character and at least three components. The
parenthesized text indicates which criteria were not met.
See the version module for more details on allowed version
formats.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Invalid type &rsquo;%s&rsquo;
in %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The given character is not
a valid pack or unpack type. See &quot;pack&quot; in
perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">(W) The given
character is not a valid pack or unpack type but used to be
silently ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Invalid version format (%s)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) A version number did not
meet the &quot;lax&quot; criteria for versions. A
&quot;lax&quot; version number is a positive decimal number
(integer or decimal-fraction) without exponentiation or else
a dotted-decimal v&minus;string. If the v&minus;string has
fewer than three components, it must have a leading
&rsquo;v&rsquo; character. Otherwise, the leading
&rsquo;v&rsquo; is optional. Both decimal and dotted-decimal
versions may have a trailing &quot;alpha&quot; component
separated by an underscore character after a fractional or
dotted-decimal component. The parenthesized text indicates
which criteria were not met. See the version module for more
details on allowed version formats.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Invalid version object</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The internal structure of
the version object was invalid. Perhaps the internals were
modified directly in some way or an arbitrary reference was
blessed into the &quot;version&quot; class.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">ioctl is not implemented</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Your machine apparently
doesn&rsquo;t implement <i>ioctl()</i>, which is pretty
strange for a machine that supports C.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>ioctl()</i> on unopened
%s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W unopened) You tried
<i>ioctl()</i> on a filehandle that was never opened. Check
your control flow and number of arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><small>IO</small> layers (like
&rsquo;%s&rsquo;) unavailable</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Your Perl has not been
configured to have PerlIO, and therefore you cannot use
<small>IO</small> layers. To have PerlIO, Perl must be
configured with &rsquo;useperlio&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">IO::Socket::atmark not
implemented on this architecture</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Your machine doesn&rsquo;t
implement the <i>sockatmark()</i> functionality, neither as
a system call nor an ioctl call ( <small>SIOCATMARK</small>
).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">$* is no longer supported</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(D deprecated, syntax) The
special variable <tt>$*</tt>, deprecated in older perls, has
been removed as of 5.9.0 and is no longer supported. In
previous versions of perl the use of <tt>$*</tt> enabled or
disabled multi-line matching within a string.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Instead of
using <tt>$*</tt> you should use the <tt>&quot;/m&quot;</tt>
(and maybe <tt>&quot;/s&quot;</tt>) regexp modifiers. You
can enable <tt>&quot;/m&quot;</tt> for a lexical scope (even
a whole file) with <tt>&quot;use re '/m'&quot;</tt>. (In
older versions: when <tt>$*</tt> was set to a true value
then all regular expressions behaved as if they were written
using <tt>&quot;/m&quot;</tt>.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">$# is no longer supported</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(D deprecated, syntax) The
special variable <tt>$#</tt>, deprecated in older perls, has
been removed as of 5.9.3 and is no longer supported. You
should use the printf/sprintf functions instead.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&rsquo;%s&rsquo; is not a code
reference</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W overload) The second
(fourth, sixth, ...) argument of overload::constant needs to
be a code reference. Either an anonymous subroutine, or a
reference to a subroutine.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&rsquo;%s&rsquo; is not an
overloadable type</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W overload) You tried to
overload a constant type the overload package is unaware
of.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">junk on end of regexp</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) The regular expression
parser is confused.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Label not found for &quot;last
%s&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You named a loop to break
out of, but you&rsquo;re not currently in a loop of that
name, not even if you count where you were called from. See
&quot;last&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Label not found for &quot;next
%s&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You named a loop to
continue, but you&rsquo;re not currently in a loop of that
name, not even if you count where you were called from. See
&quot;last&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Label not found for &quot;redo
%s&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You named a loop to
restart, but you&rsquo;re not currently in a loop of that
name, not even if you count where you were called from. See
&quot;last&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">leaving effective %s failed</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) While under the
<tt>&quot;use filetest&quot;</tt> pragma, switching the real
and effective uids or gids failed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">length/code after end of string
in unpack</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) While unpacking, the string
buffer was already used up when an unpack length/code
combination tried to obtain more data. This results in an
undefined value for the length. See &quot;pack&quot; in
perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>length()</i> used on %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W syntax) You used
<i>length()</i> on either an array or a hash when you
probably wanted a count of the items.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Array size can
be obtained by doing:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    scalar(@array);</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The number of
items in a hash can be obtained by doing:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    scalar(keys %hash);</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%;">Lexing code attempted to stuff
non&minus;Latin&minus;1 character into Latin&minus;1
input</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) An extension is attempting
to insert text into the current parse (using lex_stuff_pvn
or similar), but tried to insert a character that
couldn&rsquo;t be part of the current input. This is an
inherent pitfall of the stuffing mechanism, and one of the
reasons to avoid it. Where it is necessary to stuff,
stuffing only plain <small>ASCII</small> is recommended.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Lexing code internal error
(%s)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Lexing code supplied by an
extension violated the lexer&rsquo;s <small>API</small> in a
detectable way.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>listen()</i> on closed
socket %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W closed) You tried to do a
listen on a closed socket. Did you forget to check the
return value of your <i>socket()</i> call? See
&quot;listen&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">List form of piped open not
implemented</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) On some platforms, notably
Windows, the three-or-more-arguments form of
<tt>&quot;open&quot;</tt> does not support pipes, such as
<tt>&quot;open($pipe, '|&minus;', @args)&quot;</tt>. Use the
two-argument <tt>&quot;open($pipe, '|prog arg1
arg2...')&quot;</tt> form instead.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">localtime(%f) too large</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W overflow) You called
<tt>&quot;localtime&quot;</tt> with a number that was larger
than it can reliably handle and
<tt>&quot;localtime&quot;</tt> probably returned the wrong
date. This warning is also triggered with NaN (the special
not-a-number value).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">localtime(%f) too small</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W overflow) You called
<tt>&quot;localtime&quot;</tt> with a number that was
smaller than it can reliably handle and
<tt>&quot;localtime&quot;</tt> probably returned the wrong
date.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Lookbehind longer than %d not
implemented in regex m/%s/</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) There is currently a limit
on the length of string which lookbehind can handle. This
restriction may be eased in a future release.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Lost precision when %s %f by
1</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W) The value you attempted to
increment or decrement by one is too large for the
underlying floating point representation to store
accurately, hence the target of <tt>&quot;++&quot;</tt> or
<tt>&quot;&minus;&minus;&quot;</tt> is unchanged. Perl
issues this warning because it has already switched from
integers to floating point when values are too large for
integers, and now even floating point is insufficient. You
may wish to switch to using Math::BigInt explicitly.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>lstat()</i> on
filehandle%s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W io) You tried to do an lstat
on a filehandle. What did you mean by that? <i>lstat()</i>
makes sense only on filenames. (Perl did a <i>fstat()</i>
instead on the filehandle.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">lvalue attribute %s
already-defined subroutine</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W misc) Although attributes.pm
allows this, turning the lvalue attribute on or off on a
Perl subroutine that is already defined does not always work
properly. It may or may not do what you want, depending on
what code is inside the subroutine, with exact details
subject to change between Perl versions. Only do this if you
really know what you are doing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">lvalue attribute ignored after
the subroutine has been defined</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W misc) Using the
<tt>&quot;:lvalue&quot;</tt> declarative syntax to make a
Perl subroutine an lvalue subroutine after it has been
defined is not permitted. To make the subroutine an lvalue
subroutine, add the lvalue attribute to the definition, or
put the <tt>&quot;sub foo :lvalue;&quot;</tt> declaration
before the definition.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">See also
attributes.pm.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Malformed integer in [] in

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Between the brackets
enclosing a numeric repeat count only digits are permitted.
See &quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Malformed integer in [] in

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) An error peculiar to
<small>OS/2</small> . <small>PERLLIB_PREFIX</small> should
be of the form</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    prefix1;prefix2</pre>

<small>PERLLIB_PREFIX</small> &quot; in perlos2.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Malformed prototype for %s:
%s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You tried to use a function
with a malformed prototype. The syntax of function
prototypes is given a brief compile-time check for obvious
errors like invalid characters. A more rigorous check is run
when the function is called.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Malformed
<small>UTF&minus;8</small> character (%s)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S utf8)(F) Perl detected a
string that didn&rsquo;t comply with
<small>UTF&minus;8</small> encoding rules, even though it
had the <small>UTF8</small> flag on.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">One possible
cause is that you set the <small>UTF8</small> flag yourself
for data that you thought to be in
<small>UTF&minus;8</small> but it wasn&rsquo;t (it was for
example legacy 8&minus;bit data). To guard against this, you
can use Encode::decode_utf8.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If you use the
<tt>&quot;:encoding(UTF&minus;8)&quot;</tt> PerlIO layer for
input, invalid byte sequences are handled gracefully, but if
you use <tt>&quot;:utf8&quot;</tt>, the flag is set without
validating the data, possibly resulting in this error
message.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">See also
&quot;Handling Malformed Data&quot; in Encode.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Malformed

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The charnames handler
returned malformed <small>UTF&minus;8</small> .</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Malformed
<small>UTF&minus;8</small> string in &rsquo;%c&rsquo; format
in unpack</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You tried to unpack
something that didn&rsquo;t comply with
<small>UTF&minus;8</small> encoding rules and perl was
unable to guess how to make more progress.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Malformed
<small>UTF&minus;8</small> string in pack</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You tried to pack something

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Malformed
<small>UTF&minus;16</small> surrogate</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Perl thought it was reading
<small>UTF&minus;16</small> encoded character data but while
doing it Perl met a malformed Unicode surrogate.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">%s matches null string many
times in regex; marked by &lt;&minus;&minus;
<small>HERE</small> in m/%s/</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W regexp) The pattern
you&rsquo;ve specified would be an infinite loop if the
regular expression engine didn&rsquo;t specifically check
for that. The &lt;&minus;&minus; <small>HERE</small> shows
in the regular expression about where the problem was
discovered. See perlre.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Maximal count of pending
signals (%u) exceeded</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Perl aborted due to too
high a number of signals pending. This usually indicates
that your operating system tried to deliver signals too fast
(with a very high priority), starving the perl process from
resources it would need to reach a point where it can
process signals safely. (See &quot;Deferred Signals (Safe
Signals)&quot; in perlipc.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot;%s&quot; may clash with
future reserved word</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W) This warning may be due to

&quot;use&quot; or &quot;my&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&rsquo;%&rsquo; may not be used

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Might be a runaway multi-line
%s string starting on line %d</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S) An advisory indicating that
the previous error may have been caused by a missing
delimiter on a string or pattern, because it eventually
ended earlier on the current line.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Misplaced _ in number</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W syntax) An underscore
(underbar) in a numeric constant did not separate two
digits.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Missing argument in %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W uninitialized) A printf-type
format required more arguments than were supplied.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Missing argument to
&minus;%c</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The argument to the
indicated command line switch must follow immediately after
the switch, without intervening spaces.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Missing braces on \N{}</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Wrong syntax of character
name literal <tt>&quot;\N{charname}&quot;</tt> within
double-quotish context. This can also happen when there is a
space (or comment) between the <tt>&quot;\N&quot;</tt> and
the <tt>&quot;{&quot;</tt> in a regex with the
<tt>&quot;/x&quot;</tt> modifier. This modifier does not
change the requirement that the brace immediately follow the
<tt>&quot;\N&quot;</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Missing braces on \o{}</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) A <tt>&quot;\o&quot;</tt>
must be followed immediately by a <tt>&quot;{&quot;</tt> in
double-quotish context.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Missing comma after first
argument to %s function</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) While certain functions
allow you to specify a filehandle or an &quot;indirect
object&quot; before the argument list, this ain&rsquo;t one
of them.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Missing command in piped
open</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W pipe) You used the
<tt>&quot;open(FH, &quot;| command&quot;)&quot;</tt> or
<tt>&quot;open(FH, &quot;command |&quot;)&quot;</tt>
construction, but the command was missing or blank.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Missing control char name in
\c</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) A double-quoted string
ended with &quot;\c&quot;, without the required control
character name.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Missing name in &quot;my
sub&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The reserved syntax for
lexically scoped subroutines requires that they have a name
with which they can be found.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Missing $ on loop variable</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Apparently you&rsquo;ve
been programming in <b>csh</b> too much. Variables are
always mentioned with the $ in Perl, unlike in the shells,
where it can vary from one line to the next.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">(Missing operator before
%s?)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S syntax) This is an educated
guess made in conjunction with the message &quot;%s found
where operator expected&quot;. Often the missing operator is
a comma.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Missing right brace on %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Missing right brace in
<tt>&quot;\x{...}&quot;</tt>, <tt>&quot;\p{...}&quot;</tt>,
<tt>&quot;\P{...}&quot;</tt>, or
<tt>&quot;\N{...}&quot;</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Missing right brace on \N{} or
unescaped left brace after \N</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) <tt>&quot;\N&quot;</tt> has
two meanings.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The traditional
one has it followed by a name enclosed in braces, meaning
the character (or sequence of characters) given by that
name. Thus <tt>&quot;\N{ASTERISK}&quot;</tt> is another way
of writing <tt>&quot;*&quot;</tt>, valid in both
double-quoted strings and regular expression patterns. In
patterns, it doesn&rsquo;t have the meaning an unescaped
<tt>&quot;*&quot;</tt> does.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Starting in
Perl 5.12.0, <tt>&quot;\N&quot;</tt> also can have an
additional meaning (only) in patterns, namely to match a
non-newline character. (This is short for
<tt>&quot;[^\n]&quot;</tt>, and like <tt>&quot;.&quot;</tt>
but is not affected by the <tt>&quot;/s&quot;</tt> regex
modifier.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This can lead
to some ambiguities. When <tt>&quot;\N&quot;</tt> is not
followed immediately by a left brace, Perl assumes the
<tt>&quot;[^\n]&quot;</tt> meaning. Also, if the braces form
a valid quantifier such as <tt>&quot;\N{3}&quot;</tt> or
<tt>&quot;\N{5,}&quot;</tt>, Perl assumes that this means to
match the given quantity of non-newlines (in these examples,
3; and 5 or more, respectively). In all other case, where
there is a <tt>&quot;\N{&quot;</tt> and a matching
<tt>&quot;}&quot;</tt>, Perl assumes that a character name
is desired.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">However, if
there is no matching <tt>&quot;}&quot;</tt>, Perl
doesn&rsquo;t know if it was mistakenly omitted, or if
<tt>&quot;[^\n]{&quot;</tt> was desired, and raises this
error. If you meant the former, add the right brace; if you
meant the latter, escape the brace with a backslash, like
so: <tt>&quot;\N\{&quot;</tt></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Missing right curly or square
bracket</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The lexer counted more
opening curly or square brackets than closing ones. As a
general rule, you&rsquo;ll find it&rsquo;s missing near the
place you were last editing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">(Missing semicolon on previous
line?)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S syntax) This is an educated
guess made in conjunction with the message &quot;%s found
where operator expected&quot;. Don&rsquo;t automatically put
a semicolon on the previous line just because you saw this
message.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Modification of a read-only
value attempted</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You tried, directly or
indirectly, to change the value of a constant. You
didn&rsquo;t, of course, try &quot;2 = 1&quot;, because the
compiler catches that. But an easy way to do the same thing
is:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    sub mod { $_[0] = 1 }
    mod(2);</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Another way is
to assign to a <i>substr()</i> that&rsquo;s off the end of
the string.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Yet another way
is to assign to a <tt>&quot;foreach&quot;</tt> loop
<i><small>VAR</small></i> when <i><small>VAR</small></i> is
aliased to a constant in the look <i><small>LIST</small></i>
:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    $x = 1;
    foreach my $n ($x, 2) {
        $n *= 2; # modifies the $x, but fails on attempt to
    }            # modify the 2</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%;">Modification of non-creatable
array value attempted, %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You tried to make an array
value spring into existence, and the subscript was probably
negative, even counting from end of the array backwards.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Modification of non-creatable
hash value attempted, %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) You tried to make a hash
value spring into existence, and it couldn&rsquo;t be
created for some peculiar reason.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Module name must be
constant</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Only a bare module name is
allowed as the first argument to a &quot;use&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Module name required with
&minus;%c option</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The
<tt>&quot;&minus;M&quot;</tt> or
<tt>&quot;&minus;m&quot;</tt> options say that Perl should
load some module, but you omitted the name of the module.
Consult perlrun for full details about
<tt>&quot;&minus;M&quot;</tt> and
<tt>&quot;&minus;m&quot;</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">More than one argument to
&rsquo;%s&rsquo; open</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The
<tt>&quot;open&quot;</tt> function has been asked to open
multiple files. This can happen if you are trying to open a
pipe to a command that takes a list of arguments, but have
forgotten to specify a piped open mode. See &quot;open&quot;
in perlfunc for details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">msg%s not implemented</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You don&rsquo;t have System
V message <small>IPC</small> on your system.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Multidimensional syntax %s not
supported</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W syntax) Multidimensional
arrays aren&rsquo;t written like <tt>$foo[1,2,3]</tt>.
They&rsquo;re written like <tt>$foo[1][2][3]</tt>, as in
C.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&rsquo;/&rsquo; must follow a
numeric type in unpack</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You had an unpack template
that contained a &rsquo;/&rsquo;, but this did not follow
some unpack specification producing a numeric value. See
&quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot;my sub&quot; not yet
implemented</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Lexically scoped
subroutines are not yet implemented. Don&rsquo;t try that
yet.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot;my&quot; variable %s
can&rsquo;t be in a package</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Lexically scoped variables
aren&rsquo;t in a package, so it doesn&rsquo;t make sense to
try to declare one with a package qualifier on the front.
Use <i>local()</i> if you want to localize a package
variable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Name &quot;%s::%s&quot; used
only once: possible typo</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W once) Typographical errors
often show up as unique variable names. If you had a good
reason for having a unique name, then just mention it again
somehow to suppress the message. The
<tt>&quot;our&quot;</tt> declaration is provided for this
purpose.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><small>NOTE:</small>
This warning detects symbols that have been used only once
so <tt>$c</tt>, <tt>@c</tt>, <tt>%c</tt>, *c, &amp;c, sub
c{}, c(), and c (the filehandle or format) are considered
the same; if a program uses <tt>$c</tt> only once but also
uses any of the others it will not trigger this warning.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">\N in a character class must be
a named character: \N{...}</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The new (5.12) meaning of
<tt>&quot;\N&quot;</tt> as <tt>&quot;[^\n]&quot;</tt> is not
valid in a bracketed character class, for the same reason
that <tt>&quot;.&quot;</tt> in a character class loses its
specialness: it matches almost everything, which is probably
not what you want.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">\N{ <small>NAME</small> } must
be resolved by the lexer</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) When compiling a regex
pattern, an unresolved named character or sequence was
encountered. This can happen in any of several ways that
bypass the lexer, such as using single-quotish context, or
an extra backslash in double-quotish:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    $re = '\N{SPACE}';  # Wrong!
    $re = &quot;\\N{SPACE}&quot;; # Wrong!
    /$re/;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Instead, use
double-quotes with a single backslash:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    $re = &quot;\N{SPACE}&quot;;  # ok
    /$re/;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The lexer can
be bypassed as well by creating the pattern from smaller
components:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    $re = '\N';
    /${re}{SPACE}/;     # Wrong!</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">It&rsquo;s not
a good idea to split a construct in the middle like this,
and it doesn&rsquo;t work here. Instead use the solution
above.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Finally, the
message also can happen under the <tt>&quot;/x&quot;</tt>
regex modifier when the <tt>&quot;\N&quot;</tt> is separated
by spaces from the <tt>&quot;{&quot;</tt>, in which case,
remove the spaces.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    /\N {SPACE}/x;      # Wrong!
    /\N{SPACE}/x;       # ok</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%;">Negative &rsquo;/&rsquo; count
in unpack</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The length count obtained
from a length/code unpack operation was negative. See
&quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Negative length</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You tried to do a
read/write/send/recv operation with a buffer length that is
less than 0. This is difficult to imagine.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Negative offset to vec in
lvalue context</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) When
<tt>&quot;vec&quot;</tt> is called in an lvalue context, the
second argument must be greater than or equal to zero.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Nested quantifiers in regex;
marked by &lt;&minus;&minus; <small>HERE</small> in
m/%s/</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You can&rsquo;t quantify a
quantifier without intervening parentheses. So things like
** or +* or ?* are illegal. The &lt;&minus;&minus;
<small>HERE</small> shows in the regular expression about
where the problem was discovered.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that the
minimal matching quantifiers, <tt>&quot;*?&quot;</tt>,
<tt>&quot;+?&quot;</tt>, and <tt>&quot;??&quot;</tt> appear
to be nested quantifiers, but aren&rsquo;t. See perlre.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">%s never introduced</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S internal) The symbol in
question was declared but somehow went out of scope before
it could possibly have been used.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;">next::method/next::can/maybe::next::method
cannot find enclosing method</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F)
<tt>&quot;next::method&quot;</tt> needs to be called within
the context of a real method in a real package, and it could
not find such a context. See mro.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">No %s allowed while running
setuid</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Certain operations are
deemed to be too insecure for a setuid or setgid script to
even be allowed to attempt. Generally speaking there will be
another way to do what you want that is, if not secure, at
least securable. See perlsec.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">No code specified for
&minus;%c</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Perl&rsquo;s
<b>&minus;e</b> and <b>&minus;E</b> command-line options
require an argument. If you want to run an empty program,
pass the empty string as a separate argument or run a
program consisting of a single 0 or 1:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    perl &minus;e &quot;&quot;
    perl &minus;e0
    perl &minus;e1</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%;">No comma allowed after %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) A list operator that has a
filehandle or &quot;indirect object&quot; is not allowed to
have a comma between that and the following arguments.
Otherwise it&rsquo;d be just another one of the
arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">One possible
cause for this is that you expected to have imported a
constant to your name space with <b>use</b> or <b>import</b>
while no such importing took place, it may for example be
that your operating system does not support that particular
constant. Hopefully you did use an explicit import list for
the constants you expect to see; please see &quot;use&quot;
in perlfunc and &quot;import&quot; in perlfunc. While an
explicit import list would probably have caught this error
earlier it naturally does not remedy the fact that your
operating system still does not support that constant. Maybe
you have a typo in the constants of the symbol import list
of <b>use</b> or <b>import</b> or in the constant name at
the line where this error was triggered?</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">No command into which to pipe
on command line</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) An error peculiar to
<small>VMS</small> . Perl handles its own command line
redirection, and found a &rsquo;|&rsquo; at the end of the
command line, so it doesn&rsquo;t know where you want to
pipe the output from this command.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">No <small>DB::DB</small>
routine defined</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The currently executing
code was compiled with the <b>&minus;d</b> switch, but for
some reason the current debugger (e.g. <i>perl5db.pl</i> or
a <tt>&quot;Devel::&quot;</tt> module) didn&rsquo;t define a
routine to be called at the beginning of each statement.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">No dbm on this machine</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) This is counted as an
internal error, because every machine should supply dbm
nowadays, because Perl comes with <small>SDBM</small> . See
SDBM_File.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">No DB::sub routine defined</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The currently executing
code was compiled with the <b>&minus;d</b> switch, but for
some reason the current debugger (e.g. <i>perl5db.pl</i> or
a <tt>&quot;Devel::&quot;</tt> module) didn&rsquo;t define a
<tt>&quot;DB::sub&quot;</tt> routine to be called at the
beginning of each ordinary subroutine call.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">No directory specified for
&minus;I</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The <b>&minus;I</b>
command-line switch requires a directory name as part of the
<i>same</i> argument. Use <b>&minus;Ilib</b>, for instance.
<b>&minus;I lib</b> won&rsquo;t work.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">No error file after 2&gt; or
2&gt;&gt; on command line</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) An error peculiar to
<small>VMS</small> . Perl handles its own command line
redirection, and found a &rsquo;2&gt;&rsquo; or a
&rsquo;2&gt;&gt;&rsquo; on the command line, but can&rsquo;t
find the name of the file to which to write data destined
for stderr.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">No group ending character
&rsquo;%c&rsquo; found in template</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) A pack or unpack template
has an opening &rsquo;(&rsquo; or &rsquo;[&rsquo; without
its matching counterpart. See &quot;pack&quot; in
perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">No input file after &lt; on
command line</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) An error peculiar to
<small>VMS</small> . Perl handles its own command line
redirection, and found a &rsquo;&lt;&rsquo; on the command
line, but can&rsquo;t find the name of the file from which
to read data for stdin.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">No next::method
&rsquo;%s&rsquo; found for %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F)
<tt>&quot;next::method&quot;</tt> found no further instances
of this method name in the remaining packages of the
<small>MRO</small> of this class. If you don&rsquo;t want it
throwing an exception, use
<tt>&quot;maybe::next::method&quot;</tt> or
<tt>&quot;next::can&quot;</tt>. See mro.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot;no&quot; not allowed in
expression</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The &quot;no&quot; keyword
is recognized and executed at compile time, and returns no
useful value. See perlmod.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">No output file after &gt; on
command line</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) An error peculiar to
<small>VMS</small> . Perl handles its own command line
redirection, and found a lone &rsquo;&gt;&rsquo; at the end
of the command line, so it doesn&rsquo;t know where you
wanted to redirect stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">No output file after &gt; or
&gt;&gt; on command line</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) An error peculiar to
<small>VMS</small> . Perl handles its own command line
redirection, and found a &rsquo;&gt;&rsquo; or a
&rsquo;&gt;&gt;&rsquo; on the command line, but can&rsquo;t
find the name of the file to which to write data destined
for stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">No package name allowed for
variable %s in &quot;our&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Fully qualified variable
names are not allowed in &quot;our&quot; declarations,
because that doesn&rsquo;t make much sense under existing
semantics. Such syntax is reserved for future
extensions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">No Perl script found in
input</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You called <tt>&quot;perl
&minus;x&quot;</tt>, but no line was found in the file
beginning with #! and containing the word
&quot;perl&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">No setregid available</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Configure didn&rsquo;t find
anything resembling the <i>setregid()</i> call for your
system.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">No setreuid available</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Configure didn&rsquo;t find
anything resembling the <i>setreuid()</i> call for your
system.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">No such class field
&quot;%s&quot; in variable %s of type %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You tried to access a key
from a hash through the indicated typed variable but that
key is not allowed by the package of the same type. The
indicated package has restricted the set of allowed keys
using the fields pragma.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">No such class %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You provided a class
qualifier in a &quot;my&quot;, &quot;our&quot; or
&quot;state&quot; declaration, but this class doesn&rsquo;t
exist at this point in your program.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">No such hook: %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You specified a signal hook
that was not recognized by Perl. Currently, Perl accepts
<tt>&quot;__DIE__&quot;</tt> and
<tt>&quot;__WARN__&quot;</tt> as valid signal hooks.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">No such pipe open</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) An error peculiar to
<small>VMS</small> . The internal routine <i>my_pclose()</i>
tried to close a pipe which hadn&rsquo;t been opened. This
should have been caught earlier as an attempt to close an
unopened filehandle.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">No such signal: SIG%s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W signal) You specified a
signal name as a subscript to <tt>%SIG</tt> that was not
recognized. Say <tt>&quot;kill &minus;l&quot;</tt> in your
shell to see the valid signal names on your system.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Not a <small>CODE</small>
reference</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Perl was trying to evaluate
a reference to a code value (that is, a subroutine), but
found a reference to something else instead. You can use the
<i>ref()</i> function to find out what kind of ref it really
was. See also perlref.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Not a format reference</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) I&rsquo;m not sure how you
managed to generate a reference to an anonymous format, but
this indicates you did, and that it didn&rsquo;t exist.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Not a <small>GLOB</small>
reference</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Perl was trying to evaluate
a reference to a &quot;typeglob&quot; (that is, a symbol
table entry that looks like <tt>*foo</tt>), but found a
reference to something else instead. You can use the
<i>ref()</i> function to find out what kind of ref it really
was. See perlref.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Not a <small>HASH</small>
reference</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Perl was trying to evaluate
a reference to a hash value, but found a reference to
something else instead. You can use the <i>ref()</i>
function to find out what kind of ref it really was. See
perlref.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Not an <small>ARRAY</small>
reference</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Perl was trying to evaluate
a reference to an array value, but found a reference to
something else instead. You can use the <i>ref()</i>
function to find out what kind of ref it really was. See
perlref.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Not an unblessed
<small>ARRAY</small> reference</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You passed a reference to a
blessed array to <tt>&quot;push&quot;</tt>,
<tt>&quot;shift&quot;</tt> or another array function. These
only accept unblessed array references or arrays beginning
explicitly with <tt>&quot;@&quot;</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Not a <small>SCALAR</small>
reference</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Perl was trying to evaluate
a reference to a scalar value, but found a reference to
something else instead. You can use the <i>ref()</i>
function to find out what kind of ref it really was. See
perlref.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Not a subroutine reference</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Perl was trying to evaluate
a reference to a code value (that is, a subroutine), but
found a reference to something else instead. You can use the
<i>ref()</i> function to find out what kind of ref it really
was. See also perlref.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Not a subroutine reference in
overload table</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) An attempt was made to
specify an entry in an overloading table that doesn&rsquo;t
somehow point to a valid subroutine. See overload.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Not enough arguments for %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The function requires more
arguments than you specified.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Not enough format arguments</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W syntax) A format specified
more picture fields than the next line supplied. See
perlform.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">%s: not found</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(A) You&rsquo;ve accidentally
run your script through the Bourne shell instead of Perl.
Check the #! line, or manually feed your script into Perl
yourself.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">no <small>UTC</small> offset
information; assuming local time is <small>UTC</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S) A warning peculiar to
<small>VMS</small> . Perl was unable to find the local
timezone offset, so it&rsquo;s assuming that local system
time is equivalent to <small>UTC</small> . If it&rsquo;s
not, define the logical name
<i><small>SYS$TIMEZONE_DIFFERENTIAL</small></i> to translate
to the number of seconds which need to be added to
<small>UTC</small> to get local time.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Non-octal character
&rsquo;%c&rsquo;. Resolved as &quot;%s&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W digit) In parsing an octal
numeric constant, a character was unexpectedly encountered
that isn&rsquo;t octal. The resulting value is as
indicated.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Non-string passed as
bitmask</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W misc) A number has been
passed as a bitmask argument to <i>select()</i>. Use the
<i>vec()</i> function to construct the file descriptor
bitmasks for select. See &quot;select&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Null filename used</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You can&rsquo;t require the
null filename, especially because on many machines that
means the current directory! See &quot;require&quot; in
perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><small>NULL OP IN
RUN</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S debugging) Some internal
routine called <i>run()</i> with a null opcode pointer.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Null picture in formline</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The first argument to
formline must be a valid format picture specification. It
was found to be empty, which probably means you supplied it
an uninitialized value. See perlform.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Null realloc</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) An attempt was made to
realloc <small>NULL</small> .</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><small>NULL</small> regexp
argument</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) The internal pattern
matching routines blew it big time.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><small>NULL</small> regexp
parameter</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) The internal pattern
matching routines are out of their gourd.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Number too long</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Perl limits the
representation of decimal numbers in programs to about 250
characters. You&rsquo;ve exceeded that length. Future
versions of Perl are likely to eliminate this arbitrary
limitation. In the meantime, try using scientific notation
(e.g. &quot;1e6&quot; instead of &quot;1_000_000&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Number with no digits</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Perl was looking for a
number but found nothing that looked like a number. This
happens, for example with <tt>&quot;\o{}&quot;</tt>, with no
number between the braces.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Octal number &gt; 037777777777
non-portable</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W portable) The octal number
you specified is larger than 2**32&minus;1 (4294967295) and
therefore non-portable between systems. See perlport for
more on portability concerns.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Odd number of arguments for
overload::constant</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W overload) The call to
overload::constant contained an odd number of arguments. The
arguments should come in pairs.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Odd number of elements in
anonymous hash</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W misc) You specified an odd
number of elements to initialize a hash, which is odd,
because hashes come in key/value pairs.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Odd number of elements in hash
assignment</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W misc) You specified an odd
number of elements to initialize a hash, which is odd,
because hashes come in key/value pairs.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Offset outside string</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F)(W layer) You tried to do a
read/write/send/recv/seek operation with an offset pointing
outside the buffer. This is difficult to imagine. The sole
exceptions to this are that zero padding will take place
when going past the end of the string when either
<tt>&quot;sysread()&quot;</tt>ing a file, or when seeking
past the end of a scalar opened for I/O (in anticipation of
future reads and to imitate the behaviour with real
files).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">%s() on unopened %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W unopened) An I/O operation
was attempted on a filehandle that was never initialized.
You need to do an <i>open()</i>, a <i>sysopen()</i>, or a
<i>socket()</i> call, or call a constructor from the
FileHandle package.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&minus;%s on unopened
filehandle %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W unopened) You tried to
invoke a file test operator on a filehandle that isn&rsquo;t
open. Check your control flow. See also &quot;&minus;X&quot;
in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">oops: oopsAV</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S internal) An internal
warning that the grammar is screwed up.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">oops: oopsHV</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S internal) An internal
warning that the grammar is screwed up.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Opening dirhandle %s also as a
file</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W io, deprecated) You used
<i>open()</i> to associate a filehandle to a symbol (glob or
scalar) that already holds a dirhandle. Although legal, this
idiom might render your code confusing and is
deprecated.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Opening filehandle %s also as a
directory</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W io, deprecated) You used
<i>opendir()</i> to associate a dirhandle to a symbol (glob
or scalar) that already holds a filehandle. Although legal,
this idiom might render your code confusing and is
deprecated.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Operation &quot;%s&quot;: no
method found, %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) An attempt was made to
perform an overloaded operation for which no handler was
defined. While some handlers can be autogenerated in terms
of other handlers, there is no default handler for any
operation, unless the <tt>&quot;fallback&quot;</tt>
overloading key is specified to be true. See overload.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Operation &quot;%s&quot;
returns its argument for non-Unicode code point 0x%X</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W utf8, non_unicode) You
performed an operation requiring Unicode semantics on a code
point that is not in Unicode, so what it should do is not
defined. Perl has chosen to have it do nothing, and warn
you.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If the
operation shown is &quot;ToFold&quot;, it means that
case-insensitive matching in a regular expression was done
on the code point.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If you know
what you are doing you can turn off this warning by
<tt>&quot;no warnings 'non_unicode';&quot;</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Operation &quot;%s&quot;
returns its argument for <small>UTF&minus;16</small>
surrogate U+%X</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W utf8, surrogate) You
performed an operation requiring Unicode semantics on a
Unicode surrogate. Unicode frowns upon the use of surrogates
for anything but storing strings in
<small>UTF&minus;16</small> , but semantics are
(reluctantly) defined for the surrogates, and they are to do
nothing for this operation. Because the use of surrogates
can be dangerous, Perl warns.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If the
operation shown is &quot;ToFold&quot;, it means that
case-insensitive matching in a regular expression was done
on the code point.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If you know
what you are doing you can turn off this warning by
<tt>&quot;no warnings 'surrogate';&quot;</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Operator or semicolon missing
before %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S ambiguous) You used a
variable or subroutine call where the parser was expecting
an operator. The parser has assumed you really meant to use
an operator, but this is highly likely to be incorrect. For
example, if you say &quot;*foo *foo&quot; it will be
interpreted as if you said &quot;*foo *
&rsquo;foo&rsquo;&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot;our&quot; variable %s
redeclared</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W misc) You seem to have
already declared the same global once before in the current
lexical scope.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Out of memory!</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(X) The <i>malloc()</i>
function returned 0, indicating there was insufficient
remaining memory (or virtual memory) to satisfy the request.
Perl has no option but to exit immediately.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">At least in
Unix you may be able to get past this by increasing your
process datasize limits: in csh/tcsh use
<tt>&quot;limit&quot;</tt> and <tt>&quot;limit datasize
n&quot;</tt> (where <tt>&quot;n&quot;</tt> is the number of
kilobytes) to check the current limits and change them, and
in ksh/bash/zsh use <tt>&quot;ulimit &minus;a&quot;</tt> and
<tt>&quot;ulimit &minus;d n&quot;</tt>, respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Out of memory during %s
extend</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(X) An attempt was made to
extend an array, a list, or a string beyond the largest
possible memory allocation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Out of memory during
&quot;large&quot; request for %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The <i>malloc()</i>
function returned 0, indicating there was insufficient
remaining memory (or virtual memory) to satisfy the request.
However, the request was judged large enough (compile-time
default is 64K), so a possibility to shut down by trapping
this error is granted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Out of memory during request
for %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(X)(F) The <i>malloc()</i>
function returned 0, indicating there was insufficient
remaining memory (or virtual memory) to satisfy the
request.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The request was
judged to be small, so the possibility to trap it depends on
the way perl was compiled. By default it is not trappable.
However, if compiled for this, Perl may use the contents of
<tt>$^M</tt> as an emergency pool after <i>die()</i>ing with
this message. In this case the error is trappable
<i>once</i>, and the error message will include the line and
file where the failed request happened.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Out of memory during
ridiculously large request</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You can&rsquo;t allocate
more than 2^31+&quot;small amount&quot; bytes. This error is
most likely to be caused by a typo in the Perl program.
e.g., <tt>$arr[time]</tt> instead of
<tt>$arr[$time]</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Out of memory for yacc
stack</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The yacc parser wanted to
grow its stack so it could continue parsing, but
<i>realloc()</i> wouldn&rsquo;t give it more memory, virtual
or otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&rsquo;.&rsquo; outside of
string in pack</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The argument to a
&rsquo;.&rsquo; in your template tried to move the working
position to before the start of the packed string being
built.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&rsquo;@&rsquo; outside of
string in unpack</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You had a template that
specified an absolute position outside the string being
unpacked. See &quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&rsquo;@&rsquo; outside of
string with malformed <small>UTF&minus;8</small> in
unpack</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You had a template that
specified an absolute position outside the string being
unpacked. The string being unpacked was also invalid
<small>UTF&minus;8</small> . See &quot;pack&quot; in
perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">overload arg &rsquo;%s&rsquo;
is invalid</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W overload) The overload
pragma was passed an argument it did not recognize. Did you
mistype an operator?</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Overloaded dereference did not
return a reference</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) An object with an
overloaded dereference operator was dereferenced, but the
overloaded operation did not return a reference. See
overload.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Overloaded qr did not return a
<small>REGEXP</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) An object with a
<tt>&quot;qr&quot;</tt> overload was used as part of a
match, but the overloaded operation didn&rsquo;t return a
compiled regexp. See overload.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">%s package attribute may clash
with future reserved word: %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W reserved) A lowercase
attribute name was used that had a package-specific handler.
That name might have a meaning to Perl itself some day, even
though it doesn&rsquo;t yet. Perhaps you should use a
mixed-case attribute name, instead. See attributes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">pack/unpack repeat count
overflow</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You can&rsquo;t specify a
repeat count so large that it overflows your signed
integers. See &quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">page overflow</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W io) A single call to
<i>write()</i> produced more lines than can fit on a page.
See perlform.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">panic: %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) An internal error.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">panic: attempt to call %s in
%s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) One of the file test
operators entered a code branch that calls an
<small>ACL</small> related-function, but that function is
not available on this platform. Earlier checks mean that it
should not be possible to enter this branch on this
platform.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">panic: ck_grep, type=%u</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) Failed an internal
consistency check trying to compile a grep.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">panic: ck_split, type=%u</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) Failed an internal
consistency check trying to compile a split.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">panic: corrupt saved stack

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) The savestack was requested
to restore more localized values than there are in the
savestack.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">panic: del_backref</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) Failed an internal
consistency check while trying to reset a weak

<p style="margin-left:11%;">panic: die %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) We popped the context stack
to an eval context, and then discovered it wasn&rsquo;t an
eval context.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">panic: do_subst</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) The internal
<i>pp_subst()</i> routine was called with invalid
operational data.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">panic: do_trans_%s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) The internal do_trans
routines were called with invalid operational data.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">panic: fold_constants
<small>JMPENV_PUSH</small> returned %d</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) While attempting folding
constants an exception other than an
<tt>&quot;eval&quot;</tt> failure was caught.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">panic: frexp</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) The library function
<i>frexp()</i> failed, making printf(&quot;%f&quot;)
impossible.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">panic: goto, type=%u,
ix=%ld</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) We popped the context stack
to a context with the specified label, and then discovered
it wasn&rsquo;t a context we know how to do a goto in.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">panic: gp_free failed to free
glob pointer</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) The internal routine used
to clear a typeglob&rsquo;s entries tried repeatedly, but
each time something re-created entries in the glob. Most
likely the glob contains an object with a reference back to
the glob and a destructor that adds a new object to the
glob.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">panic:
<small>INTERPCASEMOD</small> , %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) The lexer got into a bad

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) The lexer got into a bad
state parsing a string with brackets.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">panic: kid popen errno read</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) forked child returned an
incomprehensible message about its errno.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">panic: last, type=%u</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) We popped the context stack
to a block context, and then discovered it wasn&rsquo;t a
block context.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">panic: leave_scope clearsv</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) A writable lexical variable
became read-only somehow within the scope.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">panic: leave_scope
inconsistency %u</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) The savestack probably got
out of sync. At least, there was an invalid enum on the top
of it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">panic: magic_killbackrefs</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) Failed an internal
consistency check while trying to reset all weak references

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) The compiler got confused
about which scratch pad it was allocating and freeing
temporaries and lexicals from.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">panic: pad_swipe po</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) An invalid scratch pad
offset was detected internally.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) Something terrible went
wrong in setting up for the split.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">panic: realloc, %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) Something requested a
negative number of bytes of realloc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">panic: reference miscount on
nsv in <i>sv_replace()</i> (%d != 1)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) The internal
<i>sv_replace()</i> function was handed a new
<small>SV</small> with a reference count other than 1.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">panic: restartop in %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) Some internal routine
requested a goto (or something like it), and didn&rsquo;t
supply the destination.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">panic: return, type=%u</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) We popped the context stack
to a subroutine or eval context, and then discovered it
wasn&rsquo;t a subroutine or eval context.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">panic: scan_num, %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) <i>scan_num()</i> got
called on something that wasn&rsquo;t a number.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">panic: sv_chop %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) The <i>sv_chop()</i>
routine was passed a position that is not within the
scalar&rsquo;s string buffer.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">panic: sv_insert, midend=%p,
bigend=%p</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) The <i>sv_insert()</i>
routine was told to remove more string than there was
string.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">panic: <i>strxfrm()</i> gets
absurd &minus; a =&gt; %u, ab =&gt; %u</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) The interpreter&rsquo;s
sanity check of the C function <i>strxfrm()</i> failed. In
your current locale the returned transformation of the
string &quot;ab&quot; is shorter than that of the string
&quot;a&quot;, which makes no sense.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">panic: top_env</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) The compiler attempted to
do a goto, or something weird like that.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">panic: unimplemented op %s
(#%d) called</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) The compiler is screwed up
and attempted to use an op that isn&rsquo;t permitted at run
time.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">panic: utf16_to_utf8: odd

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) Something tried to call
utf16_to_utf8 with an odd (as opposed to even) byte
length.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">panic: utf16_to_utf8_reversed:

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W regex, deprecated) You used
a regular expression with case-insensitive matching, and
there is a bug in Perl in which the built-in regular

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Perl_my_%s() not available</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Your platform has very
uncommon byte-order and integer size, so it was not possible

(un)pack templates. See &quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Perl %s required (did you mean
%s?)&minus;&minus;this is only %s, stopped</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The code you are trying to
run has asked for a newer version of Perl than you are
running. Perhaps <tt>&quot;use 5.10&quot;</tt> was written
instead of <tt>&quot;use 5.010&quot;</tt> or <tt>&quot;use
v5.10&quot;</tt>. Without the leading
<tt>&quot;v&quot;</tt>, the number is interpreted as a
decimal, with every three digits after the decimal point
representing a part of the version number. So 5.10 is
equivalent to v5.100.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Perl %s required--this is only

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Exactly what
were the failed locale settings varies. In the above the
settings were that the <small>LC_ALL</small> was
&quot;En_US&quot; and the <small>LANG</small> had no value.
This error means that Perl detected that you and/or your
operating system supplier and/or system administrator have
set up the so-called locale system but Perl could not use
those settings. This was not dead serious, fortunately:
there is a &quot;default locale&quot; called &quot;C&quot;

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W qw) <i>qw()</i> lists
contain items separated by whitespace; as with literal
strings, comment characters are not ignored, but are instead
treated as literal data. (You may have used different
delimiters than the parentheses shown here; braces are also
frequently used.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">You probably
wrote something like this:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    @list = qw(
        a # a comment

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    @list = qw(
        a
        b

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If you really
want comments, build your list the old-fashioned way, with
quotes and commas:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    @list = (
        'a',    # a comment
        'b',    # another comment
    );</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%;">Possible attempt to separate
words with commas</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W qw) <i>qw()</i> lists
contain items separated by whitespace; therefore commas
aren&rsquo;t needed to separate the items. (You may have
used different delimiters than the parentheses shown here;
braces are also frequently used.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">You probably
wrote something like this:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    qw! a, b, c !;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">which puts
literal commas into some of the list items. Write it without
commas if you don&rsquo;t want them to appear in your

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    qw! a b c !;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%;">Possible memory corruption: %s
overflowed 3rd argument</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) An <i>ioctl()</i> or
<i>fcntl()</i> returned more than Perl was bargaining for.
Perl guesses a reasonable buffer size, but puts a sentinel
byte at the end of the buffer just in case. This sentinel
byte got clobbered, and Perl assumes that memory is now
corrupted. See &quot;ioctl&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Possible precedence problem on
bitwise %c operator</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W precedence) Your program
uses a bitwise logical operator in conjunction with a
numeric comparison operator, like this :</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    if ($x &amp; $y == 0) { ... }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This expression
is actually equivalent to <tt>&quot;$x &amp; ($y ==
0)&quot;</tt>, due to the higher precedence of
<tt>&quot;==&quot;</tt>. This is probably not what you want.
(If you really meant to write this, disable the warning, or,
better, put the parentheses explicitly and write
<tt>&quot;$x &amp; ($y == 0)&quot;</tt>).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Possible unintended
interpolation of $\ in regex</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W ambiguous) You said
something like <tt>&quot;m/$\/&quot;</tt> in a regex. The
regex <tt>&quot;m/foo$\s+bar/m&quot;</tt> translates to:
match the word &rsquo;foo&rsquo;, the output record
separator (see &quot;$\&quot; in perlvar) and the letter
&rsquo;s&rsquo; (one time or more) followed by the word
&rsquo;bar&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If this is what
you intended then you can silence the warning by using
<tt>&quot;m/${\}/&quot;</tt> (for example:
<tt>&quot;m/foo${\}s+bar/&quot;</tt>).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If instead you
intended to match the word &rsquo;foo&rsquo; at the end of
the line followed by whitespace and the word
&rsquo;bar&rsquo; on the next line then you can use
<tt>&quot;m/$(?)\/&quot;</tt> (for example:
<tt>&quot;m/foo$(?)\s+bar/&quot;</tt>).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Possible unintended
interpolation of %s in string</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W ambiguous) You said
something like &rsquo;@foo&rsquo; in a double-quoted string
but there was no array <tt>@foo</tt> in scope at the time.
If you wanted a literal <tt>@foo</tt>, then write it as
\@foo; otherwise find out what happened to the array you
apparently lost track of.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Precedence problem: open %s
should be open(%s)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S precedence) The old
irregular construct</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    open FOO || die;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">is now
misinterpreted as</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    open(FOO || die);</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">because of the
strict regularization of Perl 5&rsquo;s grammar into unary
and list operators. (The old open was a little of both.) You
must put parentheses around the filehandle, or use the new
&quot;or&quot; operator instead of &quot;||&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Premature end of script

<p style="margin-left:17%;">See Server error.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>printf()</i> on closed

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Process terminated by SIG%s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W) This is a standard message
issued by <small>OS/2</small> applications, while *nix
applications die in silence. It is considered a feature of
the <small>OS/2</small> port. One can easily disable this by
appropriate sighandlers, see &quot;Signals&quot; in perlipc.
See also &quot;Process terminated by
<small>SIGTERM/SIGINT</small> &quot; in perlos2.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Prototype after
&rsquo;%c&rsquo; for %s : %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W illegalproto) A character
follows % or @ in a prototype. This is useless, since % and
@ gobble the rest of the subroutine arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Prototype mismatch: %s vs
%s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S prototype) The subroutine
being declared or defined had previously been declared or
defined with a different function prototype.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Prototype not terminated</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You&rsquo;ve omitted the
closing parenthesis in a function prototype definition.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">\p{} uses Unicode rules, not
locale rules</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W) You compiled a regular
expression that contained a Unicode property match
(<tt>&quot;\p&quot;</tt> or <tt>&quot;\P&quot;</tt>), but
the regular expression is also being told to use the
run-time locale, not Unicode. Instead, use a
<small>POSIX</small> character class, which should know
about the locale&rsquo;s rules. (See &quot;
<small>POSIX</small> Character Classes&quot; in
perlrecharclass.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Even if the
run-time locale is <small>ISO</small> 8859&minus;1 (Latin1),
which is a subset of Unicode, some properties will give
results that are not valid for that subset.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Here are a
couple of examples to help you see what&rsquo;s going on. If
the locale is <small>ISO</small> 8859&minus;7, the character
at code point 0xD7 is the &quot; <small>GREEK CAPITAL LETTER
CHI</small> &quot;. But in Unicode that code point means the
&quot; <small>MULTIPLICATION SIGN</small> &quot; instead,
and <tt>&quot;\p&quot;</tt> always uses the Unicode meaning.
That means that <tt>&quot;\p{Alpha}&quot;</tt> won&rsquo;t
match, but <tt>&quot;[[:alpha:]]&quot;</tt> should. Only in
the Latin1 locale are all the characters in the same
positions as they are in Unicode. But, even here, some
properties give incorrect results. An example is
<tt>&quot;\p{Changes_When_Uppercased}&quot;</tt> which is
true for &quot; <small>LATIN SMALL LETTER</small> Y
<small>WITH DIAERESIS</small> &quot;, but since the upper
case of that character is not in Latin1, in that locale it
doesn&rsquo;t change when upper cased.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Quantifier follows nothing in
regex; marked by &lt;&minus;&minus; <small>HERE</small> in
m/%s/</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You started a regular

literally. The &lt;&minus;&minus; <small>HERE</small> shows
in the regular expression about where the problem was
discovered. See perlre.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Quantifier in {,} bigger than
%d in regex; marked by &lt;&minus;&minus;

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Quantifier unexpected on
zero-length expression; marked by &lt;&minus;&minus;
<small>HERE</small> in <br>
m/%s/</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W regexp) You applied a
regular expression quantifier in a place where it makes no
sense, such as on a zero-width assertion. Try putting the
quantifier inside the assertion instead. For example, the
way to match &quot;abc&quot; provided that it is followed by
three repetitions of &quot;xyz&quot; is
<tt>&quot;/abc(?=(?:xyz){3})/&quot;</tt>, not
<tt>&quot;/abc(?=xyz){3}/&quot;</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Range iterator outside integer
range</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) One (or both) of the
numeric arguments to the range operator &quot;..&quot; are
outside the range which can be represented by integers
internally. One possible workaround is to force Perl to use
magical string increment by prepending &quot;0&quot; to your

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>readdir()</i> attempted on

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Recursive call to
Perl_load_module in PerlIO_find_layer</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) It is currently not
permitted to load modules when creating a filehandle inside
an <tt>%INC</tt> hook. This can happen with <tt>&quot;open
my $fh, '&lt;', \$scalar&quot;</tt>, which implicitly loads
PerlIO::scalar. Try loading PerlIO::scalar explicitly
first.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Recursive inheritance detected
in package &rsquo;%s&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) While calculating the
method resolution order ( <small>MRO</small> ) of a package,
Perl believes it found an infinite loop in the <tt>@ISA</tt>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Reference found where
even-sized list expected</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W misc) You gave a single
reference where Perl was expecting a list with an even
number of elements (for assignment to a hash). This usually
means that you used the anon hash constructor when you meant
to use parens. In any case, a hash requires key/value
<b>pairs</b>.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    %hash = { one =&gt; 1, two =&gt; 2, };    # WRONG

unclosed group in regex; marked by &lt;&minus;&minus;
<small>HERE</small> <br>
in m/%s/</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You used something like
<tt>&quot;\g{&minus;7}&quot;</tt> in your regular
expression, but there are not at least seven sets of closed
capturing parentheses in the expression before where the
<tt>&quot;\g{&minus;7}&quot;</tt> was located.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The
&lt;&minus;&minus; <small>HERE</small> shows in the regular
expression about where the problem was discovered.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">regexp memory corruption</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) The regular expression
engine got confused by what the regular expression compiler
gave it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Regexp modifier &quot;/%c&quot;
may appear a maximum of twice <br>
Regexp modifier &quot;/%c&quot; may not appear twice</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F syntax, regexp) The regular
expression pattern had too many occurrences of the specified
modifier. Remove the extraneous ones.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Regexp modifier &quot;%c&quot;
may not appear after the &quot;&minus;&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F regexp) Turning off the
given modifier has the side effect of turning on another
one. Perl currently doesn&rsquo;t allow this. Reword the
regular expression to use the modifier you want to turn on
(and place it before the minus), instead of the one you want
to turn off.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Regexp modifiers
&quot;/%c&quot; and &quot;/%c&quot; are mutually
exclusive</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F syntax, regexp) The regular
expression pattern had more than one of these mutually
exclusive modifiers. Retain only the modifier that is
supposed to be there.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Regexp out of space</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) A &quot;can&rsquo;t
happen&quot; error, because <i>safemalloc()</i> should have
caught it earlier.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Repeated format line will never
terminate (~~ and @# incompatible)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Your format contains the ~~
repeat-until-blank sequence and a numeric field that will
never go blank so that the repetition never terminates. You
might use ^# instead. See perlform.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Replacement list is longer than
search list</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W misc) You have used a
replacement list that is longer than the search list. So the
additional elements in the replacement list are
meaningless.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Reversed %s= operator</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W syntax) You wrote your
assignment operator backwards. The = must always come last,
to avoid ambiguity with subsequent unary operators.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>rewinddir()</i> attempted on
invalid dirhandle %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W io) The dirhandle you tried
to do a <i>rewinddir()</i> on is either closed or not really
a dirhandle. Check your control flow.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Scalars leaked: %d</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) Something went wrong in
Perl&rsquo;s internal bookkeeping of scalars: not all scalar
variables were deallocated by the time Perl exited. What
this usually indicates is a memory leak, which is of course
bad, especially if the Perl program is intended to be
long-running.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Scalar value @%s[%s] better
written as $%s[%s]</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W syntax) You&rsquo;ve used an
array slice (indicated by @) to select a single element of
an array. Generally it&rsquo;s better to ask for a scalar
value (indicated by $). The difference is that
<tt>$foo[&amp;bar]</tt> always behaves like a scalar, both
when assigning to it and when evaluating its argument, while
<tt>@foo[&amp;bar]</tt> behaves like a list when you assign
to it, and provides a list context to its subscript, which
can do weird things if you&rsquo;re expecting only one
subscript.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">On the other
hand, if you were actually hoping to treat the array element
as a list, you need to look into how references work,
because Perl will not magically convert between scalars and
lists for you. See perlref.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Scalar value @%s{%s} better
written as $%s{%s}</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W syntax) You&rsquo;ve used a
hash slice (indicated by @) to select a single element of a
hash. Generally it&rsquo;s better to ask for a scalar value
(indicated by $). The difference is that
<tt>$foo{&amp;bar}</tt> always behaves like a scalar, both
when assigning to it and when evaluating its argument, while
<tt>@foo{&amp;bar}</tt> behaves like a list when you assign
to it, and provides a list context to its subscript, which
can do weird things if you&rsquo;re expecting only one
subscript.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">On the other
hand, if you were actually hoping to treat the hash element
as a list, you need to look into how references work,
because Perl will not magically convert between scalars and

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Search pattern not
terminated</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The lexer couldn&rsquo;t
find the final delimiter of a // or m{} construct. Remember
that bracketing delimiters count nesting level. Missing the
leading <tt>&quot;$&quot;</tt> from a variable <tt>$m</tt>
may cause this error.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that since
Perl 5.9.0 a // can also be the <i>defined-or</i> construct,
not just the empty search pattern. Therefore code written in
Perl 5.9.0 or later that uses the // as the
<i>defined-or</i> can be misparsed by pre&minus;5.9.0 Perls
as a non-terminated search pattern.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Search pattern not terminated
or ternary operator parsed as search <br>
pattern</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The lexer couldn&rsquo;t
find the final delimiter of a <tt>&quot;?PATTERN?&quot;</tt>
construct.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The question
mark is also used as part of the ternary operator (as in
<tt>&quot;foo ? 0 : 1&quot;</tt>) leading to some ambiguous
constructions being wrongly parsed. One way to disambiguate
the parsing is to put parentheses around the conditional
expression, i.e. <tt>&quot;(foo) ? 0 : 1&quot;</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>seekdir()</i> attempted on
invalid dirhandle %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W io) The dirhandle you are
doing a <i>seekdir()</i> on is either closed or not really a
dirhandle. Check your control flow.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">%<i>sseek()</i> on unopened
filehandle</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W unopened) You tried to use
the <i>seek()</i> or <i>sysseek()</i> function on a
filehandle that was either never opened or has since been
closed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">select not implemented</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) This machine doesn&rsquo;t
implement the <i>select()</i> system call.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Self-ties of arrays and hashes
are not supported</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Self-ties are of arrays and
hashes are not supported in the current implementation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Semicolon seems to be
missing</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W semicolon) A nearby syntax
error was probably caused by a missing semicolon, or
possibly some other missing operator, such as a comma.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">semi-panic: attempt to dup
freed string</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S internal) The internal
<i>newSVsv()</i> routine was called to duplicate a scalar
that had previously been marked as free.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">sem%s not implemented</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You don&rsquo;t have System
V semaphore <small>IPC</small> on your system.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>send()</i> on closed socket
%s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W closed) The socket
you&rsquo;re sending to got itself closed sometime before
now. Check your control flow.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Sequence (? incomplete in
regex; marked by &lt;&minus;&minus; <small>HERE</small> in
m/%s/</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) A regular expression ended
with an incomplete extension (?. The &lt;&minus;&minus;
<small>HERE</small> shows in the regular expression about
where the problem was discovered. See perlre.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Sequence (?%s...) not
implemented in regex; marked by &lt;&minus;&minus;
<small>HERE</small> in m/%s/</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) A proposed regular
expression extension has the character reserved but has not
yet been written. The &lt;&minus;&minus; <small>HERE</small>
shows in the regular expression about where the problem was
discovered. See perlre.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Sequence (?%s...) not
recognized in regex; marked by &lt;&minus;&minus;
<small>HERE</small> in m/%s/</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You used a regular
expression extension that doesn&rsquo;t make sense. The
&lt;&minus;&minus; <small>HERE</small> shows in the regular
expression about where the problem was discovered. This
happens when using the <tt>&quot;(?^...)&quot;</tt>
construct to tell Perl to use the default regular expression
modifiers, and you redundantly specify a default modifier.
For other causes, see perlre.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Sequence \%s... not terminated
in regex; marked by &lt;&minus;&minus; <small>HERE</small>
in m/%s/</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The regular expression
expects a mandatory argument following the escape sequence
and this has been omitted or incorrectly written.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Sequence (?#... not terminated
in regex; marked by &lt;&minus;&minus; <small>HERE</small>
in m/%s/</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) A regular expression
comment must be terminated by a closing parenthesis.
Embedded parentheses aren&rsquo;t allowed. The
&lt;&minus;&minus; <small>HERE</small> shows in the regular
expression about where the problem was discovered. See
perlre.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Sequence (?{...}) not
terminated or not {}&minus;balanced in regex; marked by <br>
&lt;&minus;&minus; <small>HERE</small> in m/%s/</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) If the contents of a
(?{...}) clause contain braces, they must balance for Perl
to detect the end of the clause properly. The
&lt;&minus;&minus; <small>HERE</small> shows in the regular
expression about where the problem was discovered. See
perlre.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">500 Server error</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">See Server error.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Server error</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(A) This is the error message
generally seen in a browser window when trying to run a
<small>CGI</small> program (including <small>SSI</small> )
over the web. The actual error text varies widely from
server to server. The most frequently-seen variants are
&quot;500 Server error&quot;, &quot;Method (something) not
permitted&quot;, &quot;Document contains no data&quot;,
&quot;Premature end of script headers&quot;, and &quot;Did
not produce a valid header&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><b>This is a
<small>CGI</small> error, not a Perl error</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">You need to
make sure your script is executable, is accessible by the
user <small>CGI</small> is running the script under (which
is probably not the user account you tested it under), does
not rely on any environment variables (like
<small>PATH</small> ) from the user it isn&rsquo;t running

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>setegid()</i> not
implemented</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You tried to assign to
<tt>$)</tt>, and your operating system doesn&rsquo;t support
the <i>setegid()</i> system call (or equivalent), or at
least Configure didn&rsquo;t think so.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>seteuid()</i> not

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You tried to assign to
<tt>$&gt;</tt>, and your operating system doesn&rsquo;t
support the <i>seteuid()</i> system call (or equivalent), or
at least Configure didn&rsquo;t think so.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">setpgrp can&rsquo;t take
arguments</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Your system has the
<i>setpgrp()</i> from <small>BSD</small> 4.2, which takes no
arguments, unlike <small>POSIX</small> <i>setpgid()</i>,
which takes a process <small>ID</small> and process group
<small>ID</small> .</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>setrgid()</i> not
implemented</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You tried to assign to
<tt>$(</tt>, and your operating system doesn&rsquo;t support
the <i>setrgid()</i> system call (or equivalent), or at
least Configure didn&rsquo;t think so.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>setruid()</i> not

at least Configure didn&rsquo;t think so.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>setsockopt()</i> on closed
socket %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W closed) You tried to set a
socket option on a closed socket. Did you forget to check
the return value of your <i>socket()</i> call? See
&quot;setsockopt&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">shm%s not implemented</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You don&rsquo;t have System
V shared memory <small>IPC</small> on your system.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">!=~ should be !~</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W syntax) The non-matching
operator is !~, not !=~. !=~ will be interpreted as the !=
(numeric not equal) and ~ (1&rsquo;s complement) operators:
probably not what you intended.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&lt;&gt; should be quotes</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You wrote <tt>&quot;require
&lt;file&gt;&quot;</tt> when you should have written
<tt>&quot;require 'file'&quot;</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">/%s/ should probably be written
as &quot;%s&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W syntax) You have used a
pattern where Perl expected to find a string, as in the
first argument to <tt>&quot;join&quot;</tt>. Perl will treat
the true or false result of matching the pattern against
<tt>$_</tt> as the string, which is probably not what you
had in mind.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>shutdown()</i> on closed
socket %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W closed) You tried to do a
shutdown on a closed socket. Seems a bit superfluous.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">SIG%s handler &quot;%s&quot;
not defined</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W signal) The signal handler
named in <tt>%SIG</tt> doesn&rsquo;t, in fact, exist.
Perhaps you put it into the wrong package?</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Smart matching a non-overloaded
object breaks encapsulation</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You should not use the
<tt>&quot;~~&quot;</tt> operator on an object that does not
overload it: Perl refuses to use the object&rsquo;s
underlying structure for the smart match.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">sort is now a reserved word</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) An ancient error message
that almost nobody ever runs into anymore. But before sort
was a keyword, people sometimes used it as a filehandle.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Sort subroutine didn&rsquo;t
return single value</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) A sort comparison
subroutine may not return a list value with more or less
than one element. See &quot;sort&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Source filters apply only to
byte streams</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You tried to activate a
source filter (usually by loading a source filter module)
within a string passed to <tt>&quot;eval&quot;</tt>. This is
not permitted under the <tt>&quot;unicode_eval&quot;</tt>
feature. Consider using <tt>&quot;evalbytes&quot;</tt>
instead. See feature.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>splice()</i> offset past end
of array</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W misc) You attempted to
specify an offset that was past the end of the array passed
to <i>splice()</i>. Splicing will instead commence at the
end of the array, rather than past it. If this isn&rsquo;t
what you want, try explicitly pre-extending the array by
assigning $#array = <tt>$offset</tt>. See &quot;splice&quot;
in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Split loop</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) The split was looping
infinitely. (Obviously, a split shouldn&rsquo;t iterate more
times than there are characters of input, which is what
happened.) See &quot;split&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Statement unlikely to be
reached</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W exec) You did an
<i>exec()</i> with some statement after it other than a
<i>die()</i>. This is almost always an error, because
<i>exec()</i> never returns unless there was a failure. You
probably wanted to use <i>system()</i> instead, which does
return. To suppress this warning, put the <i>exec()</i> in a
block by itself.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot;state&quot; variable %s
can&rsquo;t be in a package</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Lexically scoped variables
aren&rsquo;t in a package, so it doesn&rsquo;t make sense to
try to declare one with a package qualifier on the front.
Use <i>local()</i> if you want to localize a package
variable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>stat()</i> on unopened
filehandle %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W unopened) You tried to use
the <i>stat()</i> function on a filehandle that was either
never opened or has since been closed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Stub found while resolving
method &quot;%s&quot; overloading &quot;%s&quot; in package
&quot;%s&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) Overloading resolution over
<tt>@ISA</tt> tree may be broken by importation stubs. Stubs
should never be implicitly created, but explicit calls to
<tt>&quot;can&quot;</tt> may break this.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Subroutine %s redefined</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W redefine) You redefined a
subroutine. To suppress this warning, say</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    {
        no warnings 'redefine';
        eval &quot;sub name { ... }&quot;;
    }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%;">Substitution loop</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) The substitution was
looping infinitely. (Obviously, a substitution
shouldn&rsquo;t iterate more times than there are characters
of input, which is what happened.) See the discussion of
substitution in &quot;Regexp Quote-Like Operators&quot; in
perlop.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Substitution pattern not
terminated</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The lexer couldn&rsquo;t
find the interior delimiter of an s/// or s{}{} construct.
Remember that bracketing delimiters count nesting level.
Missing the leading <tt>&quot;$&quot;</tt> from variable
<tt>$s</tt> may cause this error.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Substitution replacement not
terminated</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The lexer couldn&rsquo;t
find the final delimiter of an s/// or s{}{} construct.
Remember that bracketing delimiters count nesting level.
Missing the leading <tt>&quot;$&quot;</tt> from variable
<tt>$s</tt> may cause this error.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">substr outside of string</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W substr)(F) You tried to
reference a <i>substr()</i> that pointed outside of a
string. That is, the absolute value of the offset was larger
than the length of the string. See &quot;substr&quot; in
perlfunc. This warning is fatal if substr is used in an
lvalue context (as the left hand side of an assignment or as
a subroutine argument for example).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">sv_upgrade from type %d down to
type %d</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) Perl tried to force the
upgrade of an <small>SV</small> to a type which was actually
inferior to its current type.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Switch (?(condition)...
contains too many branches in regex; marked by <br>
&lt;&minus;&minus; <small>HERE</small> in m/%s/</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) A
(?(condition)if&minus;clause|else&minus;clause) construct
can have at most two branches (the if-clause and the
else-clause). If you want one or both to contain
alternation, such as using
<tt>&quot;this|that|other&quot;</tt>, enclose it in
clustering parentheses:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    (?(condition)(?:this|that|other)|else&minus;clause)</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The
&lt;&minus;&minus; <small>HERE</small> shows in the regular
expression about where the problem was discovered. See
perlre.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Switch condition not recognized
in regex; marked by &lt;&minus;&minus; <small>HERE</small>
in m/%s/</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) If the argument to the
(?(...)if&minus;clause|else&minus;clause) construct is a
number, it can be only a number. The &lt;&minus;&minus;
<small>HERE</small> shows in the regular expression about
where the problem was discovered. See perlre.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">switching effective %s is not
implemented</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) While under the
<tt>&quot;use filetest&quot;</tt> pragma, we cannot switch
the real and effective uids or gids.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">%s syntax <small>OK</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The final summary message
when a <tt>&quot;perl &minus;c&quot;</tt> succeeds.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">syntax error</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Probably means you had a
syntax error. Common reasons include:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    A keyword is misspelled.
    A semicolon is missing.
    A comma is missing.
    An opening or closing parenthesis is missing.
    An opening or closing brace is missing.
    A closing quote is missing.</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Often there
will be another error message associated with the syntax
error giving more information. (Sometimes it helps to turn
on <b>&minus;w</b>.) The error message itself often tells
you where it was in the line when it decided to give up.
Sometimes the actual error is several tokens before this,
because Perl is good at understanding random input.
Occasionally the line number may be misleading, and once in
a blue moon the only way to figure out what&rsquo;s
triggering the error is to call <tt>&quot;perl
&minus;c&quot;</tt> repeatedly, chopping away half the
program each time to see if the error went away. Sort of the
cybernetic version of 20&nbsp;questions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">syntax error at line %d:
&rsquo;%s&rsquo; unexpected</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(A) You&rsquo;ve accidentally
run your script through the Bourne shell instead of Perl.
Check the #! line, or manually feed your script into Perl
yourself.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">syntax error in file %s at line
%d, next 2 tokens &quot;%s&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) This error is likely to
occur if you run a perl5 script through a perl4 interpreter,
especially if the next 2 tokens are &quot;use strict&quot;
or &quot;my <tt>$var</tt>&quot; or &quot;our
<tt>$var</tt>&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>sysread()</i> on closed
filehandle %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W closed) You tried to read
from a closed filehandle.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>sysread()</i> on unopened
filehandle %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W unopened) You tried to read
from a filehandle that was never opened.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">System V %s is not implemented
on this machine</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You tried to do something
with a function beginning with &quot;sem&quot;,
&quot;shm&quot;, or &quot;msg&quot; but that System V
<small>IPC</small> is not implemented in your machine. In
some machines the functionality can exist but be
unconfigured. Consult your system support.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>syswrite()</i> on closed
filehandle %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W closed) The filehandle
you&rsquo;re writing to got itself closed sometime before
now. Check your control flow.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot;&minus;T&quot; and
&quot;&minus;B&quot; not implemented on filehandles</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Perl can&rsquo;t peek at
the stdio buffer of filehandles when it doesn&rsquo;t know
about your kind of stdio. You&rsquo;ll have to use a
filename instead.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Target of goto is too deeply
nested</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You tried to use
<tt>&quot;goto&quot;</tt> to reach a label that was too
deeply nested for Perl to reach. Perl is doing you a favor
by refusing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>telldir()</i> attempted on
invalid dirhandle %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W io) The dirhandle you tried
to <i>telldir()</i> is either closed or not really a
dirhandle. Check your control flow.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>tell()</i> on unopened
filehandle</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W unopened) You tried to use
the <i>tell()</i> function on a filehandle that was either
never opened or has since been closed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">That use of $[ is
unsupported</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Assignment to <tt>$[</tt>
is now strictly circumscribed, and interpreted as a compiler
directive. You may say only one of</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    $[ = 0;
    $[ = 1;
    ...
    local $[ = 0;
    local $[ = 1;
    ...</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This is to
prevent the problem of one module changing the array base
out from under another module inadvertently. See
&quot;$[&quot; in perlvar and arybase.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">The <i>crypt()</i> function is
unimplemented due to excessive paranoia</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Configure couldn&rsquo;t
find the <i>crypt()</i> function on your machine, probably
because your vendor didn&rsquo;t supply it, probably because
they think the U.S. Government thinks it&rsquo;s a secret,
or at least that they will continue to pretend that it is.
And if you quote me on that, I will deny it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">The %s function is
unimplemented</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The function indicated
isn&rsquo;t implemented on this architecture, according to
the probings of Configure.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">The stat preceding %s
wasn&rsquo;t an lstat</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) It makes no sense to test
the current stat buffer for symbolic linkhood if the last
stat that wrote to the stat buffer already went past the
symlink to get to the real file. Use an actual filename
instead.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">The &rsquo;unique&rsquo;
attribute may only be applied to &rsquo;our&rsquo;
variables</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) This attribute was never
supported on <tt>&quot;my&quot;</tt> or
<tt>&quot;sub&quot;</tt> declarations.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">This Perl can&rsquo;t reset
<small>CRTL</small> environ elements (%s) <br>
This Perl can&rsquo;t set <small>CRTL</small> environ
elements (%s=%s)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W internal) Warnings peculiar
to <small>VMS</small> . You tried to change or delete an
element of the <small>CRTL</small> &rsquo;s internal environ
array, but your copy of Perl wasn&rsquo;t built with a
<small>CRTL</small> that contained the <i>setenv()</i>
function. You&rsquo;ll need to rebuild Perl with a
<small>CRTL</small> that does, or redefine
<i><small>PERL_ENV_TABLES</small></i> (see perlvms) so that
the environ array isn&rsquo;t the target of the change to
<tt>%ENV</tt> which produced the warning.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">thread failed to start: %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W threads)(S) The entry point
function of threads&minus;&gt;<i>create()</i> failed for
some reason.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">times not implemented</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Your version of the C
library apparently doesn&rsquo;t do <i>times()</i>. I
suspect you&rsquo;re not running on Unix.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot;&minus;T&quot; is on the
#! line, it must also be used on the command line</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(X) The #! line (or local
equivalent) in a Perl script contains the <b>&minus;T</b>
option (or the <b>&minus;t</b> option), but Perl was not
invoked with <b>&minus;T</b> in its command line. This is an
error because, by the time Perl discovers a <b>&minus;T</b>
in a script, it&rsquo;s too late to properly taint
everything from the environment. So Perl gives up.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If the Perl
script is being executed as a command using the #! mechanism
(or its local equivalent), this error can usually be fixed
by editing the #! line so that the <b>&minus;%c</b> option
is a part of Perl&rsquo;s first argument: e.g. change
<tt>&quot;perl &minus;n &minus;%c&quot;</tt> to
<tt>&quot;perl &minus;%c &minus;n&quot;</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If the Perl
script is being executed as <tt>&quot;perl
scriptname&quot;</tt>, then the <b>&minus;%c</b> option must
appear on the command line: <tt>&quot;perl &minus;%c
scriptname&quot;</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">To%s: illegal mapping
&rsquo;%s&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You tried to define a
customized To-mapping for <i>lc()</i>, lcfirst, <i>uc()</i>,
or <i>ucfirst()</i> (or their string-inlined versions), but
you specified an illegal mapping. See &quot;User-Defined
Character Properties&quot; in perlunicode.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Too deeply nested
()&minus;groups</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Your template contains
()&minus;groups with a ridiculously deep nesting level.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Too few args to syscall</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) There has to be at least
one argument to <i>syscall()</i> to specify the system call
to call, silly dilly.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Too late for
&quot;&minus;%s&quot; option</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(X) The #! line (or local
equivalent) in a Perl script contains the <b>&minus;M</b>,
<b>&minus;m</b> or <b>&minus;C</b> option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">In the case of
<b>&minus;M</b> and <b>&minus;m</b>, this is an error
because those options are not intended for use inside
scripts. Use the <tt>&quot;use&quot;</tt> pragma
instead.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>&minus;C</b> option only works if it is specified on the
command line as well (with the same sequence of letters or
numbers following). Either specify this option on the
command line, or, if your system supports it, make your
script executable and run it directly instead of passing it
to perl.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Too late to run %s block</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W void) A <small>CHECK</small>
or <small>INIT</small> block is being defined during run
time proper, when the opportunity to run them has already
passed. Perhaps you are loading a file with
<tt>&quot;require&quot;</tt> or <tt>&quot;do&quot;</tt> when
you should be using <tt>&quot;use&quot;</tt> instead. Or
perhaps you should put the <tt>&quot;require&quot;</tt> or
<tt>&quot;do&quot;</tt> inside a <small>BEGIN</small>
block.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Too many args to syscall</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Perl supports a maximum of
only 14 args to <i>syscall()</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Too many arguments for %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The function requires fewer
arguments than you specified.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Too many )&rsquo;s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(A) You&rsquo;ve accidentally
run your script through <b>csh</b> instead of Perl. Check
the #! line, or manually feed your script into Perl
yourself.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Too many (&rsquo;s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(A) You&rsquo;ve accidentally
run your script through <b>csh</b> instead of Perl. Check
the #! line, or manually feed your script into Perl
yourself.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Trailing \ in regex m/%s/</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The regular expression ends
with an unbackslashed backslash. Backslash it. See
perlre.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Transliteration pattern not
terminated</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The lexer couldn&rsquo;t
find the interior delimiter of a tr/// or tr[][] or y/// or
y[][] construct. Missing the leading <tt>&quot;$&quot;</tt>
from variables <tt>$tr</tt> or <tt>$y</tt> may cause this
error.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Transliteration replacement not
terminated</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The lexer couldn&rsquo;t
find the final delimiter of a tr///, tr[][], y/// or y[][]
construct.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&rsquo;%s&rsquo; trapped by
operation mask</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You tried to use an
operator from a Safe compartment in which it&rsquo;s
disallowed. See Safe.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">truncate not implemented</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Your machine doesn&rsquo;t
implement a file truncation mechanism that Configure knows
about.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Type of arg %d to &amp;CORE::%s
must be %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The subroutine in question
in the <small>CORE</small> package requires its argument to
be a hard reference to data of the specified type.
Overloading is ignored, so a reference to an object that is
not the specified type, but nonetheless has overloading to
handle it, will still not be accepted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Type of arg %d to %s must be %s
(not %s)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) This function requires the
argument in that position to be of a certain type. Arrays
must be <tt>@NAME</tt> or <tt>&quot;@{EXPR}&quot;</tt>.
Hashes must be <tt>%NAME</tt> or
<tt>&quot;%{EXPR}&quot;</tt>. No implicit dereferencing is
allowed--use the { <small>EXPR</small> } forms as an
explicit dereference. See perlref.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Type of argument to %s must be
unblessed hashref or arrayref</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You called
<tt>&quot;keys&quot;</tt>, <tt>&quot;values&quot;</tt> or
<tt>&quot;each&quot;</tt> with a scalar argument that was
not a reference to an unblessed hash or array.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">umask not implemented</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Your machine doesn&rsquo;t
implement the umask function and you tried to use it to
restrict permissions for yourself ( <small>EXPR</small>
&amp; 0700).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Unable to create sub named
&quot;%s&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You attempted to create or
access a subroutine with an illegal name.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Unbalanced context: %d more
PUSHes than POPs</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W internal) The exit code
detected an internal inconsistency in how many execution
contexts were entered and left.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Unbalanced saves: %d more saves
than restores</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W internal) The exit code
detected an internal inconsistency in how many values were
temporarily localized.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Unbalanced scopes: %d more
ENTERs than LEAVEs</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W internal) The exit code
detected an internal inconsistency in how many blocks were
entered and left.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Unbalanced string table
refcount: (%d) for &quot;%s&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W internal) On exit, Perl
found some strings remaining in the shared string table used
for copy on write and for hash keys. The entries should have
been freed, so this indicates a bug somewhere.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Unbalanced tmps: %d more allocs
than frees</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W internal) The exit code
detected an internal inconsistency in how many mortal
scalars were allocated and freed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Undefined format &quot;%s&quot;
called</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The format indicated
doesn&rsquo;t seem to exist. Perhaps it&rsquo;s really in
another package? See perlform.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Undefined sort subroutine
&quot;%s&quot; called</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The sort comparison routine
specified doesn&rsquo;t seem to exist. Perhaps it&rsquo;s in
a different package? See &quot;sort&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Undefined subroutine &amp;%s
called</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The subroutine indicated
hasn&rsquo;t been defined, or if it was, it has since been
undefined.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Undefined subroutine called</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The anonymous subroutine
you&rsquo;re trying to call hasn&rsquo;t been defined, or if
it was, it has since been undefined.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Undefined subroutine in
sort</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The sort comparison routine
specified is declared but doesn&rsquo;t seem to have been
defined yet. See &quot;sort&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Undefined top format
&quot;%s&quot; called</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The format indicated
doesn&rsquo;t seem to exist. Perhaps it&rsquo;s really in
another package? See perlform.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Undefined value assigned to
typeglob</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W misc) An undefined value was
assigned to a typeglob, a la <tt>&quot;*foo =
undef&quot;</tt>. This does nothing. It&rsquo;s possible
that you really mean <tt>&quot;undef *foo&quot;</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">%s: Undefined variable</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(A) You&rsquo;ve accidentally
run your script through <b>csh</b> instead of Perl. Check
the #! line, or manually feed your script into Perl
yourself.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">unexec of %s into %s
failed!</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The <i>unexec()</i> routine
failed for some reason. See your local <small>FSF</small>
representative, who probably put it there in the first
place.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Unexpected constant lvalue
entersub entry via type/targ %d:%d</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) When compiling a subroutine
call in lvalue context, Perl failed an internal consistency
check. It encountered a malformed op tree.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Unicode non-character U+%X is
illegal for open interchange</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W utf8, nonchar) Certain
codepoints, such as U+FFFE and U+FFFF, are defined by the
Unicode standard to be non-characters. Those are legal
codepoints, but are reserved for internal use; so,
applications shouldn&rsquo;t attempt to exchange them. If
you know what you are doing you can turn off this warning by
<tt>&quot;no warnings 'nonchar';&quot;</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Unicode surrogate U+%X is
illegal in <small>UTF&minus;8</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W utf8, surrogate) You had a
<small>UTF&minus;16</small> surrogate in a context where
they are not considered acceptable. These code points,
between U+D800 and U+DFFF (inclusive), are used by Unicode
only for <small>UTF&minus;16</small> . However, Perl
internally allows all unsigned integer code points (up to
the size limit available on your platform), including
surrogates. But these can cause problems when being input or
output, which is likely where this message came from. If you
really really know what you are doing you can turn off this
warning by <tt>&quot;no warnings
'surrogate';&quot;</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Unknown
<small>BYTEORDER</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) There are no byte-swapping
functions for a machine with this byte order.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Unknown error</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) Perl was about to print an
error message in <tt>$@</tt>, but the <tt>$@</tt> variable
did not exist, even after an attempt to create it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Unknown <i>open()</i> mode
&rsquo;%s&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The second argument of
3&minus;argument <i>open()</i> is not among the list of
valid modes: <tt>&quot;&lt;&quot;</tt>,
<tt>&quot;&gt;&quot;</tt>, <tt>&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;</tt>,

<tt>&quot;&lt;&amp;&quot;</tt>,
<tt>&quot;&gt;&amp;&quot;</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Unknown PerlIO layer
&quot;%s&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W layer) An attempt was made
to push an unknown layer onto the Perl I/O system. (Layers
take care of transforming data between external and internal
representations.) Note that some layers, such as
<tt>&quot;mmap&quot;</tt>, are not supported in all
environments. If your program didn&rsquo;t explicitly
request the failing operation, it may be the result of the
value of the environment variable <small>PERLIO</small>
.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Unknown process %x sent message
to prime_env_iter: %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) An error peculiar to
<small>VMS</small> . Perl was reading values for
<tt>%ENV</tt> before iterating over it, and someone else
stuck a message in the stream of data Perl expected.
Someone&rsquo;s very confused, or perhaps trying to subvert
Perl&rsquo;s population of <tt>%ENV</tt> for nefarious
purposes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Unknown &quot;re&quot;
subpragma &rsquo;%s&rsquo; (known ones are: %s)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W) You tried to use an unknown
subpragma of the &quot;re&quot; pragma.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Unknown switch condition (?(%s
in regex; marked by &lt;&minus;&minus; <small>HERE</small>
in m/%s/</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The condition part of a
(?(condition)if&minus;clause|else&minus;clause) construct is
not known. The condition must be one of the following:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"> (1) (2) ...        true if 1st, 2nd, etc., capture matched
 (&lt;NAME&gt;) ('NAME')  true if named capture matched
 (?=...) (?&lt;=...)   true if subpattern matches
 (?!...) (?&lt;!...)   true if subpattern fails to match
 (?{ CODE })        true if code returns a true value
 (R)                true if evaluating inside recursion
 (R1) (R2) ...      true if directly inside capture group 1, 2, etc.
 (R&amp;NAME)           true if directly inside named capture
 (DEFINE)           always false; for defining named subpatterns</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The
&lt;&minus;&minus; <small>HERE</small> shows in the regular
expression about where the problem was discovered. See
perlre.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Unknown Unicode option letter
&rsquo;%c&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You specified an unknown
Unicode option. See perlrun documentation of the
<tt>&quot;&minus;C&quot;</tt> switch for the list of known
options.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Unknown Unicode option value
%x</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You specified an unknown
Unicode option. See perlrun documentation of the
<tt>&quot;&minus;C&quot;</tt> switch for the list of known
options.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Unknown verb pattern
&rsquo;%s&rsquo; in regex; marked by &lt;&minus;&minus;
<small>HERE</small> in m/%s/</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You either made a typo or
have incorrectly put a <tt>&quot;*&quot;</tt> quantifier
after an open brace in your pattern. Check the pattern and
review perlre for details on legal verb patterns.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Unknown warnings category
&rsquo;%s&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) An error issued by the
<tt>&quot;warnings&quot;</tt> pragma. You specified a
warnings category that is unknown to perl at this point.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that if
you want to enable a warnings category registered by a
module (e.g. <tt>&quot;use warnings
'File::Find'&quot;</tt>), you must have loaded this module
first.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">unmatched [ in regex; marked by
&lt;&minus;&minus; <small>HERE</small> in m/%s/</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The brackets around a
character class must match. If you wish to include a closing
bracket in a character class, backslash it or put it first.
The &lt;&minus;&minus; <small>HERE</small> shows in the
regular expression about where the problem was discovered.
See perlre.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">unmatched ( in regex; marked by
&lt;&minus;&minus; <small>HERE</small> in m/%s/</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Unbackslashed parentheses
must always be balanced in regular expressions. If
you&rsquo;re a vi user, the % key is valuable for finding
the matching parenthesis. The &lt;&minus;&minus;
<small>HERE</small> shows in the regular expression about
where the problem was discovered. See perlre.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Unmatched right %s bracket</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The lexer counted more
closing curly or square brackets than opening ones, so
you&rsquo;re probably missing a matching opening bracket. As
a general rule, you&rsquo;ll find the missing one (so to
speak) near the place you were last editing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Unquoted string &quot;%s&quot;
may clash with future reserved word</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W reserved) You used a
bareword that might someday be claimed as a reserved word.
It&rsquo;s best to put such a word in quotes, or capitalize
it somehow, or insert an underbar into it. You might also
declare it as a subroutine.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Unrecognized character %s;
marked by &lt;&minus;&minus; <small>HERE</small> after %s
near column %d</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The Perl parser has no idea
what to do with the specified character in your Perl script
(or eval) near the specified column. Perhaps you tried to
run a compressed script, a binary program, or a directory as
a Perl program.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Unrecognized escape \%c in
character class passed through in regex; <br>
marked by &lt;&minus;&minus; <small>HERE</small> in
m/%s/</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W regexp) You used a
backslash-character combination which is not recognized by
Perl inside character classes. The character was understood
literally, but this may change in a future version of Perl.
The &lt;&minus;&minus; <small>HERE</small> shows in the
regular expression about where the escape was
discovered.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Unrecognized escape \%c passed
through</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W misc) You used a
backslash-character combination which is not recognized by
Perl. The character was understood literally, but this may
change in a future version of Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Unrecognized escape \%s passed
through in regex; marked by &lt;&minus;&minus;
<small>HERE</small> in <br>
m/%s/</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W regexp) You used a
backslash-character combination which is not recognized by
Perl. The character(s) were understood literally, but this
may change in a future version of Perl. The
&lt;&minus;&minus; <small>HERE</small> shows in the regular
expression about where the escape was discovered.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Unrecognized signal name
&quot;%s&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You specified a signal name
to the <i>kill()</i> function that was not recognized. Say
<tt>&quot;kill &minus;l&quot;</tt> in your shell to see the
valid signal names on your system.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Unrecognized switch: &minus;%s
(&minus;h will show valid options)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You specified an illegal
option to Perl. Don&rsquo;t do that. (If you think you
didn&rsquo;t do that, check the #! line to see if it&rsquo;s
supplying the bad switch on your behalf.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Unsuccessful %s on filename
containing newline</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W newline) A file operation
was attempted on a filename, and that operation failed,
<small>PROBABLY</small> because the filename contained a
newline, <small>PROBABLY</small> because you forgot to
<i>chomp()</i> it off. See &quot;chomp&quot; in
perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Unsupported directory function

support <i>opendir()</i> and <i>readdir()</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Unsupported function %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) This machine doesn&rsquo;t
implement the indicated function, apparently. At least,
Configure doesn&rsquo;t think so.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Unsupported function fork</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that under
some systems, like <small>OS/2</small> , there may be
different flavors of Perl executables, some of which may

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Unsupported script encoding
%s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Your program file begins

declares it to be in a Unicode encoding that Perl cannot
read.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Unsupported socket function
&quot;%s&quot; called</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Your machine doesn&rsquo;t
support the Berkeley socket mechanism, or at least
that&rsquo;s what Configure thought.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Unterminated attribute list</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The lexer found something
other than a simple identifier at the start of an attribute,
and it wasn&rsquo;t a semicolon or the start of a block.
Perhaps you terminated the parameter list of the previous
attribute too soon. See attributes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Unterminated attribute
parameter in attribute list</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The lexer saw an opening
(left) parenthesis character while parsing an attribute
list, but the matching closing (right) parenthesis character
was not found. You may need to add (or remove) a backslash
character to get your parentheses to balance. See
attributes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Unterminated compressed
integer</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) An argument to
unpack(&quot;w&quot;,...) was incompatible with the
<small>BER</small> compressed integer format and could not
be converted to an integer. See &quot;pack&quot; in
perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Unterminated \g{...} pattern in

Fix the pattern and retry.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Unterminated &lt;&gt;
operator</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The lexer saw a left angle
bracket in a place where it was expecting a term, so
it&rsquo;s looking for the corresponding right angle
bracket, and not finding it. Chances are you left some
needed parentheses out earlier in the line, and you really
meant a &quot;less than&quot;.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    if ($[ &gt; 5.006) {
        ...

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Useless assignment to a
temporary</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W misc) You assigned to an
lvalue subroutine, but what the subroutine returned was a
temporary scalar about to be discarded, so the assignment
had no effect.</p>

lvalues such as <tt>&quot;local($x=10)&quot;</tt> is legal,
but in fact the <i>local()</i> currently has no effect. This
may change at some point in the future, but in the meantime
such code is discouraged.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Useless (?%s) &minus; use /%s

replacelist. See perlop for more information about the /d
modifier.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Useless use of \E</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W misc) You have a \E in a
double-quotish string without a <tt>&quot;\U&quot;</tt>,
<tt>&quot;\L&quot;</tt> or <tt>&quot;\Q&quot;</tt> preceding
it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Useless use of %s in void
context</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W void) You did something
without a side effect in a context that does nothing with
the return value, such as a statement that doesn&rsquo;t
return a value from a block, or the left side of a scalar
comma operator. Very often this points not to stupidity on
your part, but a failure of Perl to parse your program the
way you thought it would. For example, you&rsquo;d get this
if you mixed up your C precedence with Python precedence and
said</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    $one, $two = 1, 2;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">when you meant
to say</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    ($one, $two) = (1, 2);</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Another common
error is to use ordinary parentheses to construct a list
reference when you should be using square or curly brackets,
for example, if you say</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    $array = (1,2);</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">when you should
have said</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    $array = [1,2];</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The square
brackets explicitly turn a list value into a scalar value,
while parentheses do not. So when a parenthesized list is
evaluated in a scalar context, the comma is treated like
C&rsquo;s comma operator, which throws away the left
argument, which is not what you want. See perlref for more
on this.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This warning

useful.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Useless use of sort in scalar

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W void) You used sort in
scalar context, as in :</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    my $x = sort @y;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This is not
very useful, and perl currently optimizes this away.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Useless use of %s with no
values</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W syntax) You used the
<i>push()</i> or <i>unshift()</i> function with no arguments
apart from the array, like <tt>&quot;push(@x)&quot;</tt> or
<tt>&quot;unshift(@foo)&quot;</tt>. That won&rsquo;t usually
have any effect on the array, so is completely useless.
It&rsquo;s possible in principle that push(@tied_array)
could have some effect if the array is tied to a class which
implements a <small>PUSH</small> method. If so, you can
write it as <tt>&quot;push(@tied_array,())&quot;</tt> to
avoid this warning.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot;use&quot; not allowed in
expression</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The &quot;use&quot; keyword
is recognized and executed at compile time, and returns no
useful value. See perlmod.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Use of assignment to $[ is
deprecated</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(D deprecated) The <tt>$[</tt>

deprecated. See &quot;$[&quot; in perlvar.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Use of bare &lt;&lt; to mean

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(D deprecated) You are now
encouraged to use the explicitly quoted form if you wish to
use an empty line as the terminator of the
here-document.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Use of comma-less variable list
is deprecated</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(D deprecated) The values you
give to a format should be separated by commas, not just
aligned on a line.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Use of chdir(&rsquo;&rsquo;) or
chdir(undef) as <i>chdir()</i> deprecated</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(D deprecated) <i>chdir()</i>
with no arguments is documented to change to <tt>$ENV</tt>{
<small>HOME</small> } or <tt>$ENV</tt>{
<small>LOGDIR</small> }. chdir(undef) and
chdir(&rsquo;&rsquo;) share this behavior, but that has been
deprecated. In future versions they will simply fail.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Be careful to
check that what you pass to <i>chdir()</i> is defined and
not blank, else you might find yourself in your home
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Use of /c modifier is
meaningless in s///</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W regexp) You used the /c
modifier in a substitution. The /c modifier is not presently
meaningful in substitutions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Use of /c modifier is
meaningless without /g</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W regexp) You used the /c
modifier with a regex operand, but didn&rsquo;t use the /g
modifier. Currently, /c is meaningful only when /g is used.
(This may change in the future.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Use of := for an empty
attribute list is not allowed</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The construction
<tt>&quot;my $x := 42&quot;</tt> used to parse as equivalent
to <tt>&quot;my $x : = 42&quot;</tt> (applying an empty
attribute list to <tt>$x</tt>). This construct was
deprecated in 5.12.0, and has now been made a syntax error,
so <tt>&quot;:=&quot;</tt> can be reclaimed as a new
operator in the future.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If you need an
empty attribute list, for example in a code generator, add a
space before the <tt>&quot;=&quot;</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Use of freed value in
iteration</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Perhaps you modified the
iterated array within the loop? This error is typically
caused by code like the following:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    @a = (3,4);
    @a = () for (1,2,@a);</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">You are not
supposed to modify arrays while they are being iterated
over. For speed and efficiency reasons, Perl internally does
not do full reference-counting of iterated items, hence
deleting such an item in the middle of an iteration causes
Perl to see a freed value.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Use of *glob{
<small>FILEHANDLE</small> } is deprecated</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(D deprecated) You are now
encouraged to use the shorter *glob{ <small>IO</small> }
form to access the filehandle slot within a typeglob.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Use of /g modifier is
meaningless in split</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W regexp) You used the /g
modifier on the pattern for a <tt>&quot;split&quot;</tt>
operator. Since <tt>&quot;split&quot;</tt> always tries to
match the pattern repeatedly, the <tt>&quot;/g&quot;</tt>
has no effect.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Use of &quot;goto&quot; to jump
into a construct is deprecated</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(D deprecated) Using
<tt>&quot;goto&quot;</tt> to jump from an outer scope into
an inner scope is deprecated and should be avoided.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Use of inherited
<small>AUTOLOAD</small> for non-method %s() is
deprecated</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(D deprecated) As an (ahem)
accidental feature, <tt>&quot;AUTOLOAD&quot;</tt>
subroutines are looked up as methods (using the
<tt>@ISA</tt> hierarchy) even when the subroutines to be
autoloaded were called as plain functions (e.g.
<tt>&quot;Foo::bar()&quot;</tt>), not as methods (e.g.
<tt>&quot;Foo&minus;&gt;bar()&quot;</tt> or
<tt>&quot;$obj&minus;&gt;bar()&quot;</tt>).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This bug will
be rectified in future by using method lookup only for
methods&rsquo; <tt>&quot;AUTOLOAD&quot;</tt>s. However,
there is a significant base of existing code that may be
using the old behavior. So, as an interim step, Perl
currently issues an optional warning when non-methods use
inherited <tt>&quot;AUTOLOAD&quot;</tt>s.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The simple rule
is: Inheritance will not work when autoloading non-methods.
The simple fix for old code is: In any module that used to
depend on inheriting <tt>&quot;AUTOLOAD&quot;</tt> for
non-methods from a base class named
<tt>&quot;BaseClass&quot;</tt>, execute <tt>&quot;*AUTOLOAD
= \&amp;BaseClass::AUTOLOAD&quot;</tt> during startup.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">In code that
currently says <tt>&quot;use AutoLoader; @ISA =
qw(AutoLoader);&quot;</tt> you should remove AutoLoader from
<tt>@ISA</tt> and change <tt>&quot;use
AutoLoader;&quot;</tt> to <tt>&quot;use AutoLoader
'AUTOLOAD';&quot;</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Use of %s in printf format not
supported</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You attempted to use a
feature of printf that is accessible from only C. This
usually means there&rsquo;s a better way to do it in
Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Use of %s is deprecated</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(D deprecated) The construct
indicated is no longer recommended for use, generally
because there&rsquo;s a better way to do it, and also
because the old way has bad side effects.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Use of &minus;l on filehandle
%s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W io) A filehandle represents
an opened file, and when you opened the file it already went
past any symlink you are presumably trying to look for. The
operation returned <tt>&quot;undef&quot;</tt>. Use a
filename instead.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Use of %s on a handle without *
is deprecated</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(D deprecated) You used
<tt>&quot;tie&quot;</tt>, <tt>&quot;tied&quot;</tt> or
<tt>&quot;untie&quot;</tt> on a scalar but that scalar
happens to hold a typeglob, which means its filehandle will
be tied. If you mean to tie a handle, use an explicit * as
in <tt>&quot;tie *$handle&quot;</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This was a
long-standing bug that was removed in Perl 5.16, as there
was no way to tie the scalar itself when it held a typeglob,
and no way to untie a scalar that had had a typeglob
assigned to it. If you see this message, you must be using
an older version.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Use of ?PATTERN? without
explicit operator is deprecated</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(D deprecated) You have written
something like <tt>&quot;?\w?&quot;</tt>, for a regular
expression that matches only once. Starting this term
directly with the question mark delimiter is now deprecated,
so that the question mark will be available for use in new
operators in the future. Write <tt>&quot;m?\w?&quot;</tt>
instead, explicitly using the <tt>&quot;m&quot;</tt>
operator: the question mark delimiter still invokes
match-once behaviour.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Use of qw(...) as parentheses
is deprecated</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(D deprecated) You have
something like <tt>&quot;foreach $x qw(a b c)
{...}&quot;</tt>, using a <tt>&quot;qw(...)&quot;</tt> list
literal where a parenthesised expression is expected.
Historically the parser fooled itself into thinking that
<tt>&quot;qw(...)&quot;</tt> literals were always enclosed
in parentheses, and as a result you could sometimes omit
parentheses around them. (You could never do the
<tt>&quot;foreach qw(a b c) {...}&quot;</tt> that you might
have expected, though.) The parser no longer lies to itself
in this way. Wrap the list literal in parentheses, like
<tt>&quot;foreach $x (qw(a b c)) {...}&quot;</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Use of reference &quot;%s&quot;
as array index</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W misc) You tried to use a
reference as an array index; this probably isn&rsquo;t what
you mean, because references in numerical context tend to be
huge numbers, and so usually indicates programmer error.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If you really
do mean it, explicitly numify your reference, like so:
<tt>$array[0+$ref]</tt>. This warning is not given for
overloaded objects, however, because you can overload the
numification and stringification operators and then you
presumably know what you are doing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Use of reserved word
&quot;%s&quot; is deprecated</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(D deprecated) The indicated
bareword is a reserved word. Future versions of perl may use
it as a keyword, so you&rsquo;re better off either
explicitly quoting the word in a manner appropriate for its
context of use, or using a different name altogether. The
warning can be suppressed for subroutine names by either
adding a <tt>&quot;&amp;&quot;</tt> prefix, or using a
package qualifier, e.g. <tt>&quot;&amp;our()&quot;</tt>, or
<tt>&quot;Foo::our()&quot;</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Use of tainted arguments in %s
is deprecated</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W taint, deprecated) You have
supplied <tt>&quot;system()&quot;</tt> or
<tt>&quot;exec()&quot;</tt> with multiple arguments and at
least one of them is tainted. This used to be allowed but
will become a fatal error in a future version of perl.
Untaint your arguments. See perlsec.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Use of uninitialized
value%s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W uninitialized) An undefined
value was used as if it were already defined. It was
interpreted as a &quot;&quot; or a 0, but maybe it was a
mistake. To suppress this warning assign a defined value to
your variables.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">To help you
figure out what was undefined, perl will try to tell you the
name of the variable (if any) that was undefined. In some
cases it cannot do this, so it also tells you what operation
you used the undefined value in. Note, however, that perl
optimizes your program anid the operation displayed in the
warning may not necessarily appear literally in your
program. For example, <tt>&quot;that $foo&quot;</tt> is
usually optimized into <tt>&quot;&quot;that &quot; .
$foo&quot;</tt>, and the warning will refer to the
<tt>&quot;concatenation (.)&quot;</tt> operator, even though
there is no <tt>&quot;.&quot;</tt> in your program.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Using a hash as a reference is
deprecated</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(D deprecated) You tried to use
a hash as a reference, as in
<tt>&quot;%foo&minus;&gt;{&quot;bar&quot;}&quot;</tt> or
<tt>&quot;%$ref&minus;&gt;{&quot;hello&quot;}&quot;</tt>.
Versions of perl &lt;= 5.6.1 used to allow this syntax, but
shouldn&rsquo;t have. It is now deprecated, and will be
removed in a future version.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Using an array as a reference
is deprecated</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(D deprecated) You tried to use
an array as a reference, as in
<tt>&quot;@foo&minus;&gt;[23]&quot;</tt> or
<tt>&quot;@$ref&minus;&gt;[99]&quot;</tt>. Versions of perl
&lt;= 5.6.1 used to allow this syntax, but shouldn&rsquo;t
have. It is now deprecated, and will be removed in a future
version.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Using just the first character
returned by \N{} in character class</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W) A charnames handler may
return a sequence of more than one character. Currently all
but the first one are discarded when used in a regular
expression pattern bracketed character class.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Using !~ with %s doesn&rsquo;t
make sense</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Using the
<tt>&quot;!~&quot;</tt> operator with
<tt>&quot;s///r&quot;</tt>, <tt>&quot;tr///r&quot;</tt> or
<tt>&quot;y///r&quot;</tt> is currently reserved for future
use, as the exact behaviour has not been decided. (Simply
returning the boolean opposite of the modified string is
usually not particularly useful.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><small>UTF&minus;16</small>
surrogate U+%X</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W utf8, surrogate) You had a
<small>UTF&minus;16</small> surrogate in a context where
they are not considered acceptable. These code points,
between U+D800 and U+DFFF (inclusive), are used by Unicode
only for <small>UTF&minus;16</small> . However, Perl
internally allows all unsigned integer code points (up to
the size limit available on your platform), including
surrogates. But these can cause problems when being input or
output, which is likely where this message came from. If you
really really know what you are doing you can turn off this
warning by <tt>&quot;no warnings
'surrogate';&quot;</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Value of %s can be
&quot;0&quot;; test with <i>defined()</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W misc) In a conditional
expression, you used &lt; <small>HANDLE</small> &gt;,
&lt;*&gt; (glob), <tt>&quot;each()&quot;</tt>, or
<tt>&quot;readdir()&quot;</tt> as a boolean value. Each of
these constructs can return a value of &quot;0&quot;; that
would make the conditional expression false, which is
probably not what you intended. When using these constructs
in conditional expressions, test their values with the
<tt>&quot;defined&quot;</tt> operator.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Value of <small>CLI</small>
symbol &quot;%s&quot; too long</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W misc) A warning peculiar to
<small>VMS</small> . Perl tried to read the value of an
<tt>%ENV</tt> element from a <small>CLI</small> symbol
table, and found a resultant string longer than 1024
characters. The return value has been truncated to 1024
characters.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Variable &quot;%s&quot; is not
available</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W closure) During compilation,
an inner named subroutine or eval is attempting to capture
an outer lexical that is not currently available. This can
happen for one of two reasons. First, the outer lexical may
be declared in an outer anonymous subroutine that has not
yet been created. (Remember that named subs are created at
compile time, while anonymous subs are created at run-time.)
For example,</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    sub { my $a; sub f { $a } }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">At the time
that f is created, it can&rsquo;t capture the current value
of <tt>$a</tt>, since the anonymous subroutine hasn&rsquo;t
been created yet. Conversely, the following won&rsquo;t give
a warning since the anonymous subroutine has by now been
created and is live:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    sub { my $a; eval 'sub f { $a }' }&minus;&gt;();</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The second
situation is caused by an eval accessing a variable that has
gone out of scope, for example,</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    sub f {
        my $a;
        sub { eval '$a' }
    }
    f()&minus;&gt;();</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Here, when the
&rsquo;$a&rsquo; in the eval is being compiled, f() is not
currently being executed, so its <tt>$a</tt> is not
available for capture.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Variable &quot;%s&quot; is not
imported%s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W misc) With &quot;use
strict&quot; in effect, you referred to a global variable
that you apparently thought was imported from another
module, because something else of the same name (usually a
subroutine) is exported by that module. It usually means you
put the wrong funny character on the front of your
variable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Variable length lookbehind not
implemented in m/%s/</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Lookbehind is allowed only
for subexpressions whose length is fixed and known at
compile time. See perlre.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot;%s&quot; variable %s
masks earlier declaration in same %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W misc) A &quot;my&quot;,
&quot;our&quot; or &quot;state&quot; variable has been
redeclared in the current scope or statement, effectively
eliminating all access to the previous instance. This is
almost always a typographical error. Note that the earlier
variable will still exist until the end of the scope or
until all closure referents to it are destroyed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Variable syntax</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(A) You&rsquo;ve accidentally
run your script through <b>csh</b> instead of Perl. Check
the #! line, or manually feed your script into Perl
yourself.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Variable &quot;%s&quot; will
not stay shared</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W closure) An inner (nested)
<i>named</i> subroutine is referencing a lexical variable
defined in an outer named subroutine.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">When the inner
subroutine is called, it will see the value of the outer
subroutine&rsquo;s variable as it was before and during the
*first* call to the outer subroutine; in this case, after
the first call to the outer subroutine is complete, the
inner and outer subroutines will no longer share a common
value for the variable. In other words, the variable will no
longer be shared.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This problem
can usually be solved by making the inner subroutine
anonymous, using the <tt>&quot;sub {}&quot;</tt> syntax.
When inner anonymous subs that reference variables in outer
subroutines are created, they are automatically rebound to
the current values of such variables.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">vector argument not supported
with alpha versions</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W internal) The <tt>%vd</tt>
(s)printf format does not support version objects with alpha
parts.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Verb pattern &rsquo;%s&rsquo;
has a mandatory argument in regex; marked by
&lt;&minus;&minus; <small>HERE</small> <br>
in m/%s/</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You used a verb pattern
that requires an argument. Supply an argument or check that
you are using the right verb.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Verb pattern &rsquo;%s&rsquo;
may not have an argument in regex; marked by
&lt;&minus;&minus; <small>HERE</small> <br>
in m/%s/</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You used a verb pattern
that is not allowed an argument. Remove the argument or
check that you are using the right verb.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Version number must be a
constant number</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) The attempt to translate a
<tt>&quot;use Module n.n LIST&quot;</tt> statement into its
equivalent <tt>&quot;BEGIN&quot;</tt> block found an
internal inconsistency with the version number.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Version string &rsquo;%s&rsquo;
contains invalid data; ignoring: &rsquo;%s&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W misc) The version string
contains invalid characters at the end, which are being
ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Warning: something&rsquo;s
wrong</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W) You passed <i>warn()</i> an
empty string (the equivalent of <tt>&quot;warn
&quot;&quot;&quot;</tt>) or you called it with no args and
<tt>$@</tt> was empty.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Warning: unable to close
filehandle %s properly</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S) The implicit <i>close()</i>
done by an <i>open()</i> got an error indication on the
<i>close()</i>. This usually indicates your file system ran
out of disk space.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Warning: Use of &quot;%s&quot;
without parentheses is ambiguous</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S ambiguous) You wrote a unary
operator followed by something that looks like a binary
operator that could also have been interpreted as a term or
unary operator. For instance, if you know that the rand
function has a default argument of 1.0, and you write</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    rand + 5;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">you may
<small>THINK</small> you wrote the same thing as</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    rand() + 5;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">but in actual
fact, you got</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    rand(+5);</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">So put in
parentheses to say what you really mean.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Wide character in %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S utf8) Perl met a wide
character (&gt;255) when it wasn&rsquo;t expecting one. This
warning is by default on for I/O (like print). The easiest
way to quiet this warning is simply to add the
<tt>&quot;:utf8&quot;</tt> layer to the output, e.g.
<tt>&quot;binmode STDOUT, ':utf8'&quot;</tt>. Another way to
turn off the warning is to add <tt>&quot;no warnings
'utf8';&quot;</tt> but that is often closer to cheating. In
general, you are supposed to explicitly mark the filehandle
with an encoding, see open and &quot;binmode&quot; in
perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Within []&minus;length
&rsquo;%c&rsquo; not allowed</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The count in the (un)pack
template may be replaced by <tt>&quot;[TEMPLATE]&quot;</tt>
only if <tt>&quot;TEMPLATE&quot;</tt> always matches the
same amount of packed bytes that can be determined from the
template alone. This is not possible if it contains any of
the codes @, /, U, u, w or a *&minus;length. Redesign the
template.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>write()</i> on closed
filehandle %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W closed) The filehandle
you&rsquo;re writing to got itself closed sometime before
now. Check your control flow.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">%s &quot;\x%X&quot; does not
map to Unicode</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) When reading in different
encodings Perl tries to map everything into Unicode
characters. The bytes you read in are not legal in this
encoding, for example</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    utf8 &quot;\xE4&quot; does not map to Unicode</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">if you try to
read in the a&minus;diaereses Latin&minus;1 as
<small>UTF&minus;8</small> .</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&rsquo;X&rsquo; outside of
string</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You had a (un)pack template
that specified a relative position before the beginning of
the string being (un)packed. See &quot;pack&quot; in
perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&rsquo;x&rsquo; outside of
string in unpack</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You had a pack template
that specified a relative position after the end of the
string being unpacked. See &quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><small>YOU HAVEN</small>
&rsquo;T <small>DISABLED</small> SET-ID <small>SCRIPTS IN
THE KERNEL YET</small> !</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) And you probably never
will, because you probably don&rsquo;t have the sources to
your kernel, and your vendor probably doesn&rsquo;t give a
rip about what you want. Your best bet is to put a setuid C
wrapper around your script.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">You need to quote
&quot;%s&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W syntax) You assigned a
bareword as a signal handler name. Unfortunately, you
already have a subroutine of that name declared, which means
that Perl 5 will try to call the subroutine when the
assignment is executed, which is probably not what you want.
(If it <small>IS</small> what you want, put an &amp; in
front.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Your random numbers are not
that random</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) When trying to initialise
the random seed for hashes, Perl could not get any
randomness out of your system. This usually indicates
Something Very Wrong.</p>
