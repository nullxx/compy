<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">perlreftut
&minus; Mark&rsquo;s very short tutorial about
references</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">One of the most
important new features in Perl 5 was the capability to
manage complicated data structures like multidimensional
arrays and nested hashes. To enable these, Perl 5 introduced
a feature called &rsquo;references&rsquo;, and using
references is the key to managing complicated, structured
data in Perl. Unfortunately, there&rsquo;s a lot of funny
syntax to learn, and the main manual page can be hard to
follow. The manual is quite complete, and sometimes people
find that a problem, because it can be hard to tell what is
important and what isn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Fortunately,
you only need to know 10% of what&rsquo;s in the main page
to get 90% of the benefit. This page will show you that
10%.</p>

<h2>Who Needs Complicated Data Structures?
<a name="Who Needs Complicated Data Structures?"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">One problem
that came up all the time in Perl 4 was how to represent a
hash whose values were lists. Perl 4 had hashes, of course,
but the values had to be scalars; they couldn&rsquo;t be
lists.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Why would you
want a hash of lists? Let&rsquo;s take a simple example: You
have a file of city and country names, like this:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">        Chicago, USA
        Frankfurt, Germany
        Berlin, Germany
        Washington, USA
        Helsinki, Finland
        New York, USA</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">and you want to
produce an output like this, with each country mentioned
once, and then an alphabetical list of the cities in that
country:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">        Finland: Helsinki.
        Germany: Berlin, Frankfurt.
        USA:  Chicago, New York, Washington.</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The natural way
to do this is to have a hash whose keys are country names.
Associated with each country name key is a list of the
cities in that country. Each time you read a line of input,
split it into a country and a city, look up the list of
cities already known to be in that country, and append the
new city to the list. When you&rsquo;re done reading the
input, iterate over the hash as usual, sorting each list of
cities before you print it out.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If hash values
can&rsquo;t be lists, you lose. In Perl 4, hash values
can&rsquo;t be lists; they can only be strings. You lose.
You&rsquo;d probably have to combine all the cities into a
single string somehow, and then when time came to write the
output, you&rsquo;d have to break the string into a list,
sort the list, and turn it back into a string. This is messy
and error-prone. And it&rsquo;s frustrating, because Perl
already has perfectly good lists that would solve the
problem if only you could use them.</p>

<h2>The Solution
<a name="The Solution"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">By the time
Perl 5 rolled around, we were already stuck with this
design: Hash values must be scalars. The solution to this is
references.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A reference is
a scalar value that <i>refers to</i> an entire array or an
entire hash (or to just about anything else). Names are one
kind of reference that you&rsquo;re already familiar with.
Think of the President of the United States: a messy,
inconvenient bag of blood and bones. But to talk about him,
or to represent him in a computer program, all you need is
the easy, convenient scalar string &quot;Barack
Obama&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">References in
Perl are like names for arrays and hashes. They&rsquo;re
Perl&rsquo;s private, internal names, so you can be sure
they&rsquo;re unambiguous. Unlike &quot;Barack Obama&quot;,
a reference only refers to one thing, and you always know
what it refers to. If you have a reference to an array, you
can recover the entire array from it. If you have a
reference to a hash, you can recover the entire hash. But
the reference is still an easy, compact scalar value.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can&rsquo;t
have a hash whose values are arrays; hash values can only be
scalars. We&rsquo;re stuck with that. But a single reference
can refer to an entire array, and references are scalars, so
you can have a hash of references to arrays, and it&rsquo;ll
act a lot like a hash of arrays, and it&rsquo;ll be just as
useful as a hash of arrays.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">We&rsquo;ll
come back to this city-country problem later, after
we&rsquo;ve seen some syntax for managing references.</p>

<h2>Syntax
<a name="Syntax"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There are just
two ways to make a reference, and just two ways to use it
once you have it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Making
References</b> <b><i><br>
Make Rule 1</i></b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you put a
<tt>&quot;\&quot;</tt> in front of a variable, you get a
reference to that variable.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    $aref = \@array;         # $aref now holds a reference to @array
    $href = \%hash;          # $href now holds a reference to %hash
    $sref = \$scalar;        # $sref now holds a reference to $scalar</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Once the
reference is stored in a variable like <tt>$aref</tt> or
<tt>$href</tt>, you can copy it or store it just the same as
any other scalar value:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    $xy = $aref;             # $xy now holds a reference to @array
    $p[3] = $href;           # $p[3] now holds a reference to %hash
    $z = $p[3];              # $z now holds a reference to %hash</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These examples
show how to make references to variables with names.
Sometimes you want to make an array or a hash that
doesn&rsquo;t have a name. This is analogous to the way you
like to be able to use the string <tt>&quot;\n&quot;</tt> or
the number 80 without having to store it in a named variable
first.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Make Rule
2</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><tt>&quot;[
ITEMS ]&quot;</tt> makes a new, anonymous array, and returns
a reference to that array. <tt>&quot;{ ITEMS }&quot;</tt>
makes a new, anonymous hash, and returns a reference to that
hash.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    $aref = [ 1, &quot;foo&quot;, undef, 13 ];
    # $aref now holds a reference to an array
    $href = { APR =&gt; 4, AUG =&gt; 8 };
    # $href now holds a reference to a hash</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The references
you get from rule 2 are the same kind of references that you
get from rule 1:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">        # This:
        $aref = [ 1, 2, 3 ];
        # Does the same as this:
        @array = (1, 2, 3);
        $aref = \@array;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The first line
is an abbreviation for the following two lines, except that
it doesn&rsquo;t create the superfluous array variable
<tt>@array</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you write
just <tt>&quot;[]&quot;</tt>, you get a new, empty anonymous
array. If you write just <tt>&quot;{}&quot;</tt>, you get a
new, empty anonymous hash.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Using
References</b> <br>
What can you do with a reference once you have it?
It&rsquo;s a scalar value, and we&rsquo;ve seen that you can
store it as a scalar and get it back again just like any
scalar. There are just two more ways to use it:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b><i>Use Rule
1</i></b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can always
use an array reference, in curly braces, in place of the
name of an array. For example, <tt>&quot;@{$aref}&quot;</tt>
instead of <tt>@array</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Here are some
examples of that:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Arrays:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">        @a              @{$aref}                An array
        reverse @a      reverse @{$aref}        Reverse the array
        $a[3]           ${$aref}[3]             An element of the array
        $a[3] = 17;     ${$aref}[3] = 17        Assigning an element</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On each line
are two expressions that do the same thing. The left-hand
versions operate on the array <tt>@a</tt>. The right-hand
versions operate on the array that is referred to by
<tt>$aref</tt>. Once they find the array they&rsquo;re
operating on, both versions do the same things to the
arrays.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Using a hash
reference is <i>exactly</i> the same:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">        %h              %{$href}              A hash
        keys %h         keys %{$href}         Get the keys from the hash
        $h{'red'}       ${$href}{'red'}       An element of the hash
        $h{'red'} = 17  ${$href}{'red'} = 17  Assigning an element</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Whatever you
want to do with a reference, <b>Use Rule 1</b> tells you how
to do it. You just write the Perl code that you would have
written for doing the same thing to a regular array or hash,
and then replace the array or hash name with
<tt>&quot;{$reference}&quot;</tt>. &quot;How do I loop over
an array when all I have is a reference?&quot; Well, to loop
over an array, you would write</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">        for my $element (@array) {
           ...
        }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">so replace the
array name, <tt>@array</tt>, with the reference:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">        for my $element (@{$aref}) {
           ...
        }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;How do I
print out the contents of a hash when all I have is a
reference?&quot; First write the code for printing out a
hash:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">        for my $key (keys %hash) {
          print &quot;$key =&gt; $hash{$key}\n&quot;;
        }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">And then
replace the hash name with the reference:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">        for my $key (keys %{$href}) {
          print &quot;$key =&gt; ${$href}{$key}\n&quot;;
        }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b><i>Use Rule
2</i></b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Use Rule
1</b> is all you really need, because it tells you how to do
absolutely everything you ever need to do with references.
But the most common thing to do with an array or a hash is
to extract a single element, and the <b>Use Rule 1</b>
notation is cumbersome. So there is an abbreviation.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><tt>&quot;${$aref}[3]&quot;</tt>
is too hard to read, so you can write
<tt>&quot;$aref&minus;&gt;[3]&quot;</tt> instead.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><tt>&quot;${$href}{red}&quot;</tt>
is too hard to read, so you can write
<tt>&quot;$href&minus;&gt;{red}&quot;</tt> instead.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If
<tt>$aref</tt> holds a reference to an array, then
<tt>&quot;$aref&minus;&gt;[3]&quot;</tt> is the fourth
element of the array. Don&rsquo;t confuse this with
<tt>$aref[3]</tt>, which is the fourth element of a totally
different array, one deceptively named <tt>@aref</tt>.
<tt>$aref</tt> and <tt>@aref</tt> are unrelated the same way
that <tt>$item</tt> and <tt>@item</tt> are.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Similarly,
<tt>&quot;$href&minus;&gt;{'red'}&quot;</tt> is part of the
hash referred to by the scalar variable <tt>$href</tt>,
perhaps even one with no name. <tt>$href{'red'}</tt> is part
of the deceptively named <tt>%href</tt> hash. It&rsquo;s
easy to forget to leave out the
<tt>&quot;&minus;&gt;&quot;</tt>, and if you do,
you&rsquo;ll get bizarre results when your program gets
array and hash elements out of totally unexpected hashes and
arrays that weren&rsquo;t the ones you wanted to use.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>An
Example</b> <br>
Let&rsquo;s see a quick example of how all this is
useful.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">First, remember
that <tt>&quot;[1, 2, 3]&quot;</tt> makes an anonymous array
containing <tt>&quot;(1, 2, 3)&quot;</tt>, and gives you a
reference to that array.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Now think
about</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">        @a = ( [1, 2, 3],
               [4, 5, 6],
               [7, 8, 9]
             );</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">@a is an array
with three elements, and each one is a reference to another
array.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><tt>$a[1]</tt>
is one of these references. It refers to an array, the array
containing <tt>&quot;(4, 5, 6)&quot;</tt>, and because it is
a reference to an array, <b>Use Rule 2</b> says that we can
write <tt>$a[1]&minus;&gt;[2]</tt> to get the third element
from that array. <tt>$a[1]&minus;&gt;[2]</tt> is the 6.
Similarly, <tt>$a[0]&minus;&gt;[1]</tt> is the 2. What we
have here is like a two-dimensional array; you can write
<tt>$a[ROW]&minus;&gt;[COLUMN]</tt> to get or set the
element in any row and any column of the array.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The notation
still looks a little cumbersome, so there&rsquo;s one more
abbreviation:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Arrow
Rule</b> <br>
In between two <b>subscripts</b>, the arrow is optional.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Instead of
<tt>$a[1]&minus;&gt;[2]</tt>, we can write
<tt>$a[1][2]</tt>; it means the same thing. Instead of
<tt>&quot;$a[0]&minus;&gt;[1] = 23&quot;</tt>, we can write
<tt>&quot;$a[0][1] = 23&quot;</tt>; it means the same
thing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Now it really
looks like two-dimensional arrays!</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can see why
the arrows are important. Without them, we would have had to
write <tt>&quot;${$a[1]}[2]&quot;</tt> instead of
<tt>$a[1][2]</tt>. For three-dimensional arrays, they let us
write <tt>$x[2][3][5]</tt> instead of the unreadable
<tt>&quot;${${$x[2]}[3]}[5]&quot;</tt>.</p>

<h2>Solution
<a name="Solution"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Here&rsquo;s
the answer to the problem I posed earlier, of reformatting a
file of city and country names.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    1   my %table;
    2   while (&lt;&gt;) {
    3    chomp;
    4     my ($city, $country) = split /, /;
    5     $table{$country} = [] unless exists $table{$country};
    6     push @{$table{$country}}, $city;
    7   }
    8   foreach $country (sort keys %table) {
    9     print &quot;$country: &quot;;
   10     my @cities = @{$table{$country}};
   11     print join ', ', sort @cities;
   12     print &quot;.\n&quot;;
   13   }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The program has
two pieces: Lines 2&minus;&minus;7 read the input and build
a data structure, and lines 8&minus;13 analyze the data and
print out the report. We&rsquo;re going to have a hash,
<tt>%table</tt>, whose keys are country names, and whose
values are references to arrays of city names. The data
structure will look like this:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">           %table
        +&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;+&minus;&minus;&minus;+
        |       |   |   +&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;+&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;+
        |Germany| *&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&gt;| Frankfurt | Berlin |
        |       |   |   +&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;+&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;+

        +&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;+&minus;&minus;&minus;+</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">We&rsquo;ll
look at output first. Supposing we already have this
structure, how do we print it out?</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    8   foreach $country (sort keys %table) {
    9     print &quot;$country: &quot;;
   10     my @cities = @{$table{$country}};
   11     print join ', ', sort @cities;
   12     print &quot;.\n&quot;;
   13   }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">%table is an
ordinary hash, and we get a list of keys from it, sort the
keys, and loop over the keys as usual. The only use of
references is in line 10. <tt>$table{$country}</tt> looks up
the key <tt>$country</tt> in the hash and gets the value,
which is a reference to an array of cities in that country.
<b>Use Rule 1</b> says that we can recover the array by
saying <tt>&quot;@{$table{$country}}&quot;</tt>. Line 10 is
just like</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">        @cities = @array;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">except that the
name <tt>&quot;array&quot;</tt> has been replaced by the
reference <tt>&quot;{$table{$country}}&quot;</tt>. The
<tt>&quot;@&quot;</tt> tells Perl to get the entire array.
Having gotten the list of cities, we sort it, join it, and
print it out as usual.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Lines 2&minus;7
are responsible for building the structure in the first
place. Here they are again:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    2   while (&lt;&gt;) {
    3    chomp;
    4     my ($city, $country) = split /, /;
    5     $table{$country} = [] unless exists $table{$country};
    6     push @{$table{$country}}, $city;
    7   }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Lines 2&minus;4
acquire a city and country name. Line 5 looks to see if the
country is already present as a key in the hash. If
it&rsquo;s not, the program uses the <tt>&quot;[]&quot;</tt>
notation (<b>Make Rule 2</b>) to manufacture a new, empty
anonymous array of cities, and installs a reference to it
into the hash under the appropriate key.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Line 6 installs
the city name into the appropriate array.
<tt>$table{$country}</tt> now holds a reference to the array
of cities seen in that country so far. Line 6 is exactly
like</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">        push @array, $city;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">except that the
name <tt>&quot;array&quot;</tt> has been replaced by the
reference <tt>&quot;{$table{$country}}&quot;</tt>. The
<tt>&quot;push&quot;</tt> adds a city name to the end of the
referred-to array.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There&rsquo;s
one fine point I skipped. Line 5 is unnecessary, and we can
get rid of it.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    2   while (&lt;&gt;) {
    3    chomp;
    4     my ($city, $country) = split /, /;
    5   ####  $table{$country} = [] unless exists $table{$country};
    6     push @{$table{$country}}, $city;
    7   }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If
there&rsquo;s already an entry in <tt>%table</tt> for the
current <tt>$country</tt>, then nothing is different. Line 6
will locate the value in <tt>$table{$country}</tt>, which is
a reference to an array, and push <tt>$city</tt> into the
array. But what does it do when <tt>$country</tt> holds a
key, say <tt>&quot;Greece&quot;</tt>, that is not yet in
<tt>%table</tt>?</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This is Perl,
so it does the exact right thing. It sees that you want to
push <tt>&quot;Athens&quot;</tt> onto an array that
doesn&rsquo;t exist, so it helpfully makes a new, empty,
anonymous array for you, installs it into <tt>%table</tt>,
and then pushes <tt>&quot;Athens&quot;</tt> onto it. This is
called &rsquo;autovivification&rsquo;&minus;&minus;bringing
things to life automatically. Perl saw that they key
wasn&rsquo;t in the hash, so it created a new hash entry
automatically. Perl saw that you wanted to use the hash
value as an array, so it created a new empty array and
installed a reference to it in the hash automatically. And
as usual, Perl made the array one element longer to hold the
new city name.</p>

<h2>The Rest
<a name="The Rest"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">I promised to
give you 90% of the benefit with 10% of the details, and
that means I left out 90% of the details. Now that you have
an overview of the important parts, it should be easier to
read the perlref manual page, which discusses 100% of the
details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Some of the
highlights of perlref:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>&bull;</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>You can make references to anything, including scalars,
functions, and other references.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>&bull;</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>In <b>Use Rule 1</b>, you can omit the curly brackets
whenever the thing inside them is an atomic scalar variable
like <tt>$aref</tt>. For example, <tt>@$aref</tt> is the
same as <tt>&quot;@{$aref}&quot;</tt>, and
<tt>$$aref[1]</tt> is the same as
<tt>&quot;${$aref}[1]&quot;</tt>. If you&rsquo;re just
starting out, you may want to adopt the habit of always
including the curly brackets.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>&bull;</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>This doesn&rsquo;t copy the underlying array:</p></td></tr>
</table>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">        $aref2 = $aref1;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">You get two
references to the same array. If you modify
<tt>&quot;$aref1&minus;&gt;[23]&quot;</tt> and then look at
<tt>&quot;$aref2&minus;&gt;[23]&quot;</tt> you&rsquo;ll see
the change.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">To copy the
array, use</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">        $aref2 = [@{$aref1}];</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This uses
<tt>&quot;[...]&quot;</tt> notation to create a new
anonymous array, and <tt>$aref2</tt> is assigned a reference
to the new array. The new array is initialized with the
contents of the array referred to by <tt>$aref1</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Similarly, to
copy an anonymous hash, you can use</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">        $href2 = {%{$href1}};</pre>



<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&bull;</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">To see if a variable contains a
reference, use the <tt>&quot;ref&quot;</tt> function. It
returns true if its argument is a reference. Actually
it&rsquo;s a little better than that: It returns
<tt>&quot;HASH&quot;</tt> for hash references and
<tt>&quot;ARRAY&quot;</tt> for array references.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>&bull;</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>If you try to use a reference like a string, you get
strings like</p></td></tr>
</table>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">        ARRAY(0x80f5dec)   or    HASH(0x826afc0)</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If you ever see
a string that looks like this, you&rsquo;ll know you printed
out a reference by mistake.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">A side effect
of this representation is that you can use
<tt>&quot;eq&quot;</tt> to see if two references refer to
the same thing. (But you should usually use
<tt>&quot;==&quot;</tt> instead because it&rsquo;s much
faster.)</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&bull;</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can use a string as if it
were a reference. If you use the string
<tt>&quot;foo&quot;</tt> as an array reference, it&rsquo;s
taken to be a reference to the array <tt>@foo</tt>. This is
called a <i>soft reference</i> or <i>symbolic reference</i>.
The declaration <tt>&quot;use strict 'refs'&quot;</tt>
disables this feature, which can cause all sorts of trouble
if you use it by accident.</p></td></tr>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You might
prefer to go on to perllol instead of perlref; it discusses
lists of lists and multidimensional arrays in detail. After
that, you should move on to perldsc; it&rsquo;s a Data
Structure Cookbook that shows recipes for using and printing
out arrays of hashes, hashes of arrays, and other kinds of
data.</p>

<h2>Summary
<a name="Summary"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Everyone needs
compound data structures, and in Perl the way you get them
is with references. There are four important rules for
managing references: Two for making references and two for
using them. Once you know these rules you can do most of the
important things you need to do with references.</p>
