<h2>PCRE DISCUSSION OF STACK USAGE
<a name="PCRE DISCUSSION OF STACK USAGE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When you call
<b>pcre[16|32]_exec()</b>, it makes use of an internal
function called <b>match()</b>. This calls itself
recursively at branch points in the pattern, in order to
remember the state of the match so that it can back up and
try a different alternative if the first one fails. As
matching proceeds deeper and deeper into the tree of
possibilities, the recursion depth increases. The
<b>match()</b> function is also called in other
circumstances, for example, whenever a parenthesized
sub-pattern is entered, and in certain cases of
repetition.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Not all calls
of <b>match()</b> increase the recursion depth; for an item
such as a* it may be called several times at the same level,
after matching different numbers of a&rsquo;s. Furthermore,
in a number of cases where the result of the recursive call
would immediately be passed back as the result of the
current call (a &quot;tail recursion&quot;), the function is
just restarted instead.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The above
comments apply when <b>pcre[16|32]_exec()</b> is run in its
normal interpretive manner. If the pattern was studied with
the PCRE_STUDY_JIT_COMPILE option, and just-in-time
compiling was successful, and the options passed to
<b>pcre[16|32]_exec()</b> were not incompatible, the
matching process uses the JIT-compiled code instead of the
<b>match()</b> function. In this case, the memory
requirements are handled entirely differently. See the
<b>pcrejit</b> documentation for details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>pcre[16|32]_dfa_exec()</b> function operates in an
entirely different way, and uses recursion only when there
is a regular expression recursion or subroutine call in the
pattern. This includes the processing of assertion and
&quot;once-only&quot; subpatterns, which are handled like
subroutine calls. Normally, these are never very deep, and
the limit on the complexity of <b>pcre[16|32]_dfa_exec()</b>
is controlled by the amount of workspace it is given.
However, it is possible to write patterns with runaway
infinite recursions; such patterns will cause
<b>pcre[16|32]_dfa_exec()</b> to run out of stack. At
present, there is no protection against this.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The comments
that follow do NOT apply to <b>pcre[16|32]_dfa_exec()</b>;
they are relevant only for <b>pcre[16|32]_exec()</b> without
the JIT optimization.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Reducing
pcre[16|32]_exec()&rsquo;s stack usage</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Each time that
<b>match()</b> is actually called recursively, it uses
memory from the process stack. For certain kinds of pattern
and data, very large amounts of stack may be needed, despite
the recognition of &quot;tail recursion&quot;. You can often
reduce the amount of recursion, and therefore the amount of
stack used, by modifying the pattern that is being matched.
Consider, for example, this pattern:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">([^&lt;]|&lt;(?!inet))+</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It matches from
wherever it starts until it encounters &quot;&lt;inet&quot;
or the end of the data, and is the kind of pattern that
might be used when processing an XML file. Each iteration of
the outer parentheses matches either one character that is
not &quot;&lt;&quot; or a &quot;&lt;&quot; that is not
followed by &quot;inet&quot;. However, each time a
parenthesis is processed, a recursion occurs, so this
formulation uses a stack frame for each matched character.
For a long string, a lot of stack is required. Consider now
this rewritten pattern, which matches exactly the same
strings:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">([^&lt;]++|&lt;(?!inet))+</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This uses very
much less stack, because runs of characters that do not
contain &quot;&lt;&quot; are &quot;swallowed&quot; in one
item inside the parentheses. Recursion happens only when a
&quot;&lt;&quot; character that is not followed by
&quot;inet&quot; is encountered (and we assume this is
relatively rare). A possessive quantifier is used to stop
any backtracking into the runs of non-&quot;&lt;&quot;
characters, but that is not related to stack usage.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This example
shows that one way of avoiding stack problems when matching
long subject strings is to write repeated parenthesized
subpatterns to match more than one character whenever
possible.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Compiling
PCRE to use heap instead of stack for
pcre[16|32]_exec()</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In environments
where stack memory is constrained, you might want to compile
PCRE to use heap memory instead of stack for remembering
back-up points when <b>pcre[16|32]_exec()</b> is running.
This makes it run a lot more slowly, however. Details of how
to do this are given in the <b>pcrebuild</b> documentation.
When built in this way, instead of using the stack, PCRE
obtains and frees memory by calling the functions that are
pointed to by the <b>pcre[16|32]_stack_malloc</b> and
<b>pcre[16|32]_stack_free</b> variables. By default, these
point to <b>malloc()</b> and <b>free()</b>, but you can
replace the pointers to cause PCRE to use your own
functions. Since the block sizes are always the same, and
are always freed in reverse order, it may be possible to
implement customized memory handlers that are more efficient
than the standard functions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Limiting
pcre[16|32]_exec()&rsquo;s stack usage</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can set
limits on the number of times that <b>match()</b> is called,
both in total and recursively. If a limit is exceeded,
<b>pcre[16|32]_exec()</b> returns an error code. Setting
suitable limits should prevent it from running out of stack.
The default values of the limits are very large, and
unlikely ever to operate. They can be changed when PCRE is
built, and they can also be set when
<b>pcre[16|32]_exec()</b> is called. For details of these
interfaces, see the <b>pcrebuild</b> documentation and the
section on extra data for <b>pcre[16|32]_exec()</b> in the
<b>pcreapi</b> documentation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As a very rough
rule of thumb, you should reckon on about 500 bytes per
recursion. Thus, if you want to limit your stack usage to
8Mb, you should set the limit at 16000 recursions. A 64Mb
stack, on the other hand, can support around 128000
recursions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In Unix-like
environments, the <b>pcretest</b> test program has a command
line option (<b>-S</b>) that can be used to increase the
size of its stack. As long as the stack is large enough,
another option (<b>-M</b>) can be used to find the smallest
limits that allow a particular pattern to match a given
subject string. This is done by calling
<b>pcre[16|32]_exec()</b> repeatedly with different
limits.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Obtaining an
estimate of stack usage</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The actual
amount of stack used per recursion can vary quite a lot,
depending on the compiler that was used to build PCRE and
the optimization or debugging options that were set for it.
The rule of thumb value of 500 bytes mentioned above may be
larger or smaller than what is actually needed. A better
approximation can be obtained by running this command:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">pcretest -m
-C</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The <b>-C</b>
option causes <b>pcretest</b> to output information about
the options with which PCRE was compiled. When <b>-m</b> is
also given (before <b>-C</b>), information about stack use
is given in a line like this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Match recursion
uses stack: approximate frame size = 640 bytes</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The value is
approximate because some recursions need a bit more (up to
perhaps 16 more bytes).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the above
command is given when PCRE is compiled to use the heap
instead of the stack for recursion, the value that is output
is the size of each block that is obtained from the
heap.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Changing
stack size in Unix-like systems</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In Unix-like
environments, there is not often a problem with the stack
unless very long strings are involved, though the default
limit on stack size varies from system to system. Values
from 8Mb to 64Mb are common. You can find your default limit
by running the command:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">ulimit -s</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Unfortunately,
the effect of running out of stack is often SIGSEGV, though
sometimes a more explicit error message is given. You can
normally increase the limit on stack size by code such as
this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">struct rlimit
rlim; <br>
getrlimit(RLIMIT_STACK, &amp;rlim); <br>
rlim.rlim_cur = 100*1024*1024; <br>
setrlimit(RLIMIT_STACK, &amp;rlim);</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This reads the
current limits (soft and hard) using <b>getrlimit()</b>,
then attempts to increase the soft limit to 100Mb using
<b>setrlimit()</b>. You must do this before calling
<b>pcre[16|32]_exec()</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Changing
stack size in Mac OS X</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Using
<b>setrlimit()</b>, as described above, should also work on
Mac OS X. It is also possible to set a stack size when
linking a program. There is a discussion about stack sizes
in Mac OS X at this web site:
