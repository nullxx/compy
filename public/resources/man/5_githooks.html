<h2>SYNOPSIS

</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$GIT_DIR/hooks/*</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Hooks are
little scripts you can place in $GIT_DIR/hooks directory to
trigger action at certain points. When <i>git init</i> is
run, a handful of example hooks are copied into the hooks
directory of the new repository, but by default they are all
disabled. To enable a hook, rename it by removing its
.sample suffix.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><b><big>Note</big></b>
<br>
It is also a requirement for a given hook to be executable.
However &minus; in a freshly initialized repository &minus;
the .sample files are executable by default.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This document
describes the currently defined hooks.</p>

<h2>HOOKS
<a name="HOOKS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b><big>applypatch&minus;msg</big></b>
<big><br>
This hook is invoked by <i>git am</i> script. It takes a
single parameter, the name of the file that holds the
proposed commit log message. Exiting with non&minus;zero
status causes <i>git am</i> to abort before applying the
patch.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>The hook
is allowed to edit the message file in place, and can be
used to normalize the message into some project standard
format (if the project has one). It can also be used to
refuse the commit after inspecting the message
file.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>The
default <i>applypatch&minus;msg</i> hook, when enabled, runs
the <i>commit&minus;msg</i> hook, if the latter is
enabled.</big></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big><b>pre&minus;applypatch</b>
<br>
This hook is invoked by <i>git am</i>. It takes no
parameter, and is invoked after the patch is applied, but
before a commit is made.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>If it
exits with non&minus;zero status, then the working tree will
not be committed after applying the patch.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>It can be
used to inspect the current working tree and refuse to make
a commit if it does not pass certain test.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>The
default <i>pre&minus;applypatch</i> hook, when enabled, runs
the <i>pre&minus;commit</i> hook, if the latter is
enabled.</big></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big><b>post&minus;applypatch</b>
<br>
This hook is invoked by <i>git am</i>. It takes no
parameter, and is invoked after the patch is applied and a
commit is made.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>This hook
is meant primarily for notification, and cannot affect the
outcome of <i>git am</i>.</big></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big><b>pre&minus;commit</b>
<br>
This hook is invoked by <i>git commit</i>, and can be
bypassed with &minus;&minus;no&minus;verify option. It takes
no parameter, and is invoked before obtaining the proposed
commit log message and making a commit. Exiting with
non&minus;zero status from this script causes the <i>git
commit</i> to abort.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>The
default <i>pre&minus;commit</i> hook, when enabled, catches
introduction of lines with trailing whitespaces and aborts
the commit when such a line is found.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>All the
<i>git commit</i> hooks are invoked with the environment
variable GIT_EDITOR=: if the command will not bring up an
editor to modify the commit message.</big></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big><b>prepare&minus;commit&minus;msg</b>
<br>
This hook is invoked by <i>git commit</i> right after
preparing the default log message, and before the editor is
started.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>It takes
one to three parameters. The first is the name of the file
that contains the commit log message. The second is the
source of the commit message, and can be: message (if a
&minus;m or &minus;F option was given); template (if a
&minus;t option was given or the configuration option
commit.template is set); merge (if the commit is a merge or
a .git/MERGE_MSG file exists); squash (if a .git/SQUASH_MSG
file exists); or commit, followed by a commit SHA&minus;1
(if a &minus;c, &minus;C or &minus;&minus;amend option was
given).</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>If the
exit status is non&minus;zero, <i>git commit</i> will
abort.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>The
purpose of the hook is to edit the message file in place,
and it is not suppressed by the
&minus;&minus;no&minus;verify option. A non&minus;zero exit
means a failure of the hook and aborts the commit. It should
not be used as replacement for pre&minus;commit
hook.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>The sample
prepare&minus;commit&minus;msg hook that comes with Git
comments out the Conflicts: part of a merge&rsquo;s commit
message.</big></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big><b>commit&minus;msg</b>
<br>
This hook is invoked by <i>git commit</i>, and can be
bypassed with &minus;&minus;no&minus;verify option. It takes
a single parameter, the name of the file that holds the
proposed commit log message. Exiting with non&minus;zero
status causes the <i>git commit</i> to abort.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>The hook
is allowed to edit the message file in place, and can be
used to normalize the message into some project standard
format (if the project has one). It can also be used to
refuse the commit after inspecting the message
file.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>The
default <i>commit&minus;msg</i> hook, when enabled, detects
duplicate &quot;Signed&minus;off&minus;by&quot; lines, and
aborts the commit if one is found.</big></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big><b>post&minus;commit</b>
<br>
This hook is invoked by <i>git commit</i>. It takes no
parameter, and is invoked after a commit is made.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>This hook
is meant primarily for notification, and cannot affect the
outcome of <i>git commit</i>.</big></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big><b>pre&minus;rebase</b>
<br>
This hook is called by <i>git rebase</i> and can be used to
prevent a branch from getting rebased. The hook may be
called with one or two parameters. The first parameter is
the upstream from which the series was forked. The second
parameter is the branch being rebased, and is not set when
rebasing the current branch.</big></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big><b>post&minus;checkout</b>
<br>
This hook is invoked when a <i>git checkout</i> is run after
having updated the worktree. The hook is given three
parameters: the ref of the previous HEAD, the ref of the new
HEAD (which may or may not have changed), and a flag
indicating whether the checkout was a branch checkout
(changing branches, flag=1) or a file checkout (retrieving a
file from the index, flag=0). This hook cannot affect the
outcome of <i>git checkout</i>.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>It is also
run after <i>git clone</i>, unless the
&minus;&minus;no&minus;checkout (&minus;n) option is used.
The first parameter given to the hook is the null&minus;ref,
the second the ref of the new HEAD and the flag is always
1.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>This hook
can be used to perform repository validity checks,
auto&minus;display differences from the previous HEAD if
different, or set working dir metadata properties.</big></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big><b>post&minus;merge</b>
<br>
This hook is invoked by <i>git merge</i>, which happens when
a <i>git pull</i> is done on a local repository. The hook
takes a single parameter, a status flag specifying whether
or not the merge being done was a squash merge. This hook
cannot affect the outcome of <i>git merge</i> and is not
executed, if the merge failed due to conflicts.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>This hook
can be used in conjunction with a corresponding
pre&minus;commit hook to save and restore any form of
metadata associated with the working tree (eg:
permissions/ownership, ACLS, etc). See
contrib/hooks/setgitperms.perl for an example of how to do
this.</big></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big><b>pre&minus;push</b>
<br>
This hook is called by <i>git push</i> and can be used to
prevent a push from taking place. The hook is called with
two parameters which provide the name and location of the
destination remote, if a named remote is not being used both
values will be the same.</big></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>Information
about what is to be pushed is provided on the hook&rsquo;s
standard input with lines of the form:</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><big>&lt;local
ref&gt; SP &lt;local sha1&gt; SP &lt;remote ref&gt; SP
&lt;remote sha1&gt; LF</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>For
instance, if the command git push origin master:foreign were
run the hook would receive a line like the
following:</big></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><big>refs/heads/master
67890 refs/heads/foreign 12345</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>although
the full, 40&minus;character SHA&minus;1s would be supplied.
If the foreign ref does not yet exist the &lt;remote
SHA&minus;1&gt; will be 40 0. If a ref is to be deleted, the
&lt;local ref&gt; will be supplied as (delete) and the
&lt;local SHA&minus;1&gt; will be 40 0. If the local commit
was specified by something other than a name which could be
expanded (such as HEAD~, or a SHA&minus;1) it will be
supplied as it was originally given.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>If this
hook exits with a non&minus;zero status, <i>git push</i>
will abort without pushing anything. Information about why
the push is rejected may be sent to the user by writing to
standard error.</big></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big><b>pre&minus;receive</b>
<br>
This hook is invoked by <i>git&minus;receive&minus;pack</i>
on the remote repository, which happens when a <i>git
push</i> is done on a local repository. Just before starting
to update refs on the remote repository, the
pre&minus;receive hook is invoked. Its exit status
determines the success or failure of the update.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>This hook
executes once for the receive operation. It takes no
arguments, but for each ref to be updated it receives on
standard input a line of the format:</big></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><big>&lt;old&minus;value&gt;
SP &lt;new&minus;value&gt; SP &lt;ref&minus;name&gt;
LF</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>where
&lt;old&minus;value&gt; is the old object name stored in the
ref, &lt;new&minus;value&gt; is the new object name to be
stored in the ref and &lt;ref&minus;name&gt; is the full
name of the ref. When creating a new ref,
&lt;old&minus;value&gt; is 40 0.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>If the
hook exits with non&minus;zero status, none of the refs will
be updated. If the hook exits with zero, updating of
individual refs can still be prevented by the <i>update</i>
hook.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>Both
standard output and standard error output are forwarded to
<i>git send&minus;pack</i> on the other end, so you can
simply echo messages for the user.</big></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big><b>update</b>
<br>
This hook is invoked by <i>git&minus;receive&minus;pack</i>
on the remote repository, which happens when a <i>git
push</i> is done on a local repository. Just before updating
the ref on the remote repository, the update hook is
invoked. Its exit status determines the success or failure
of the ref update.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>The hook
executes once for each ref to be updated, and takes three
parameters:</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><big>&bull; the
name of the ref being updated,</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><big>&bull; the
old object name stored in the ref,</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><big>&bull; and
the new objectname to be stored in the ref.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>A zero
exit from the update hook allows the ref to be updated.
Exiting with a non&minus;zero status prevents
<i>git&minus;receive&minus;pack</i> from updating that
ref.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>This hook
can be used to prevent <i>forced</i> update on certain refs
by making sure that the object name is a commit object that
is a descendant of the commit object named by the old object
name. That is, to enforce a &quot;fast&minus;forward
only&quot; policy.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>It could
also be used to log the old..new status. However, it does
not know the entire set of branches, so it would end up
firing one e&minus;mail per ref when used naively, though.
The <i>post&minus;receive</i> hook is more suited to
that.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>Another
use suggested on the mailing list is to use this hook to
implement access control which is finer grained than the one
based on filesystem group.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>Both
standard output and standard error output are forwarded to
<i>git send&minus;pack</i> on the other end, so you can
simply echo messages for the user.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>The
default <i>update</i> hook, when enabled&mdash;and with
hooks.allowunannotated config option unset or set to
false&mdash;prevents unannotated tags to be
pushed.</big></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big><b>post&minus;receive</b>
<br>
This hook is invoked by <i>git&minus;receive&minus;pack</i>
on the remote repository, which happens when a <i>git
push</i> is done on a local repository. It executes on the
remote repository once after all the refs have been
updated.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>This hook
executes once for the receive operation. It takes no
arguments, but gets the same information as the
<i>pre&minus;receive</i> hook does on its standard
input.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>This hook
does not affect the outcome of
<i>git&minus;receive&minus;pack</i>, as it is called after
the real work is done.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>This
supersedes the <i>post&minus;update</i> hook in that it gets
both old and new values of all the refs in addition to their
names.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>Both
standard output and standard error output are forwarded to
<i>git send&minus;pack</i> on the other end, so you can
simply echo messages for the user.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>The
default <i>post&minus;receive</i> hook is empty, but there
is a sample script post&minus;receive&minus;email provided
in the contrib/hooks directory in Git distribution, which
implements sending commit emails.</big></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big><b>post&minus;update</b>
<br>
This hook is invoked by <i>git&minus;receive&minus;pack</i>
on the remote repository, which happens when a <i>git
push</i> is done on a local repository. It executes on the
remote repository once after all the refs have been
updated.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>It takes a
variable number of parameters, each of which is the name of
ref that was actually updated.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>This hook
is meant primarily for notification, and cannot affect the
outcome of <i>git&minus;receive&minus;pack</i>.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>The
<i>post&minus;update</i> hook can tell what are the heads
that were pushed, but it does not know what their original
and updated values are, so it is a poor place to do log
old..new. The <i>post&minus;receive</i> hook does get both
original and updated values of the refs. You might consider
it instead if you need them.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>When
enabled, the default <i>post&minus;update</i> hook runs
<i>git update&minus;server&minus;info</i> to keep the
information used by dumb transports (e.g., HTTP)
up&minus;to&minus;date. If you are publishing a Git
repository that is accessible via HTTP, you should probably
enable this hook.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>Both
standard output and standard error output are forwarded to
<i>git send&minus;pack</i> on the other end, so you can
simply echo messages for the user.</big></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big><b>pre&minus;auto&minus;gc</b>
<br>
This hook is invoked by <i>git gc &minus;&minus;auto</i>. It
takes no parameter, and exiting with non&minus;zero status
from this script causes the <i>git gc &minus;&minus;auto</i>
to abort.</big></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big><b>post&minus;rewrite</b>
<br>
This hook is invoked by commands that rewrite commits (git
commit &minus;&minus;amend, <i>git&minus;rebase</i>;
currently <i>git&minus;filter&minus;branch</i> does
<i>not</i> call it!). Its first argument denotes the command
it was invoked by: currently one of amend or rebase. Further
command&minus;dependent arguments may be passed in the
future.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>The hook
receives a list of the rewritten commits on stdin, in the
format</big></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><big>&lt;old&minus;sha1&gt;
SP &lt;new&minus;sha1&gt; [ SP &lt;extra&minus;info&gt; ]
LF</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>The
<i>extra&minus;info</i> is again command&minus;dependent. If
it is empty, the preceding SP is also omitted. Currently, no
commands pass any <i>extra&minus;info</i>.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>The hook
always runs after the automatic note copying (see
&quot;notes.rewrite.&lt;command&gt;&quot; in
<b>git-config.txt</b>(1)) has happened, and thus has access
to these notes.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>The
following command&minus;specific comments apply:</big></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>rebase</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><big>For the <i>squash</i> and
<i>fixup</i> operation, all commits that were squashed are
listed as being rewritten to the squashed commit. This means
that there will be several lines sharing the same
<i>new&minus;sha1</i>.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><big>The
commits are guaranteed to be listed in the order that they
were processed by rebase.</big></p>
