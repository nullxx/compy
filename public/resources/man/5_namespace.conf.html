<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">namespace.conf
&minus; the namespace configuration file</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>pam_namespace.so</i> module allows setup of private
namespaces with polyinstantiated directories. Directories
can be polyinstantiated based on user name or, in the case
of SELinux, user name, sensitivity level or complete
security context. If an executable script
/etc/security/namespace.init exists, it is used to
initialize the namespace every time an instance directory is
set up and mounted. The script receives the polyinstantiated
directory path and the instance directory path as its
arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
/etc/security/namespace.conf file specifies which
directories are polyinstantiated, how they are
polyinstantiated, how instance directories would be named,
and any users for whom polyinstantiation would not be
performed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When someone
logs in, the file namespace.conf is scanned. Comments are
marked by <i>#</i> characters. Each non comment line
represents one polyinstantiated directory. The fields are
separated by spaces but can be quoted by <i>&quot;</i>
characters also escape sequences <i>\b</i>, <i>\n</i>, and
<i>\t</i> are recognized. The fields are as follows:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>polydirinstance_prefixmethodlist_of_uids</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The first
field, <i>polydir</i>, is the absolute pathname of the
directory to polyinstantiate. The special string
<i>$HOME</i> is replaced with the user's home directory, and
<i>$USER</i> with the username. This field cannot be
blank.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The second
field, <i>instance_prefix</i> is the string prefix used to
build the pathname for the instantiation of &lt;polydir&gt;.
Depending on the polyinstantiation <i>method</i> it is then
appended with &quot;instance differentiation string&quot; to
generate the final instance directory path. This directory
is created if it did not exist already, and is then bind
mounted on the &lt;polydir&gt; to provide an instance of
&lt;polydir&gt; based on the &lt;method&gt; column. The
special string <i>$HOME</i> is replaced with the user's home
directory, and <i>$USER</i> with the username. This field
cannot be blank.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The third
field, <i>method</i>, is the method used for
polyinstantiation. It can take these values;
&quot;user&quot; for polyinstantiation based on user name,
&quot;level&quot; for polyinstantiation based on process MLS
level and user name, &quot;context&quot; for
polyinstantiation based on process security context and user
name, &quot;tmpfs&quot; for mounting tmpfs filesystem as an
instance dir, and &quot;tmpdir&quot; for creating temporary
directory as an instance dir which is removed when the
user's session is closed. Methods &quot;context&quot; and
&quot;level&quot; are only available with SELinux. This
field cannot be blank.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The fourth
field, <i>list_of_uids</i>, is a comma separated list of
user names for whom the polyinstantiation is not performed.
If left blank, polyinstantiation will be performed for all
users. If the list is preceded with a single &quot;~&quot;
character, polyinstantiation is performed only for users in
the list.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>method</i> field can contain also following optional
flags separated by <i>:</i> characters.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>create</i>=<i>mode</i>,<i>owner</i>,<i>group</i>
&minus; create the polyinstantiated directory. The mode,
owner and group parameters are optional. The default for
mode is determined by umask, the default owner is the user
whose session is opened, the default group is the primary
group of the user.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>iscript</i>=<i>path</i>
&minus; path to the instance directory init script. The base
directory for relative paths is
/etc/security/namespace.d.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>noinit</i>
&minus; instance directory init script will not be
executed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>shared</i>
&minus; the instance directories for &quot;context&quot; and
&quot;level&quot; methods will not contain the user name and
will be shared among all users.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>mntopts</i>=<i>value</i>
&minus; value of this flag is passed to the mount call when
the tmpfs mount is done. It allows for example the
specification of the maximum size of the tmpfs instance that
is created by the mount call. See <b>mount</b>(8) for
details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The directory
where polyinstantiated instances are to be created, must
exist and must have, by default, the mode of 0000. The
requirement that the instance parent be of mode 0000 can be
overridden with the command line option
<i>ignore_instance_parent_mode</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In case of
context or level polyinstantiation the SELinux context which
is used for polyinstantiation is the context used for
executing a new process as obtained by getexeccon. This
context must be set by the calling application or
pam_selinux.so module. If this context is not set the
polyinstatiation will be based just on user name.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;instance differentiation string&quot; is &lt;user
name&gt; for &quot;user&quot; method and &lt;user
name&gt;_&lt;raw directory context&gt; for
&quot;context&quot; and &quot;level&quot; methods. If the
whole string is too long the end of it is replaced with
md5sum of itself. Also when command line option
<i>gen_hash</i> is used the whole string is replaced with
md5sum of itself.</p>

<h2>EXAMPLES
<a name="EXAMPLES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These are some
example lines which might be specified in
/etc/security/namespace.conf.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"># The following
three lines will polyinstantiate /tmp, <br>
# /var/tmp and user's home directories. /tmp and /var/tmp
<br>
# will be polyinstantiated based on the security level <br>
# as well as user name, whereas home directory will be <br>
# polyinstantiated based on the full security context and
user name. <br>
# Polyinstantiation will not be performed for user root <br>
# and adm for directories /tmp and /var/tmp, whereas home
<br>
# directories will be polyinstantiated for all users. <br>
# <br>
# Note that instance directories do not have to reside
inside <br>
# the polyinstantiated directory. In the examples below,
<br>
# instances of /tmp will be created in /tmp&minus;inst
directory, <br>
# where as instances of /var/tmp and users home directories
<br>
# will reside within the directories that are being <br>
# polyinstantiated. <br>
# <br>
