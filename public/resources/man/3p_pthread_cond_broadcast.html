<h2>DESCRIPTION

</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These functions
shall unblock threads blocked on a condition variable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>pthread_cond_broadcast</i>() function shall unblock all
threads currently blocked on the specified condition
variable <i>cond</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>pthread_cond_signal</i>() function shall unblock at least
one of the threads that are blocked on the specified
condition variable <i>cond</i> (if any threads are blocked
on <i>cond</i>).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If more than
one thread is blocked on a condition variable, the
scheduling policy shall determine the order in which threads
are unblocked. When each thread unblocked as a result of a
<i>pthread_cond_broadcast</i>() or
<i>pthread_cond_signal</i>() returns from its call to
<i>pthread_cond_wait</i>() or
<i>pthread_cond_timedwait</i>(), the thread shall own the
mutex with which it called <i>pthread_cond_wait</i>() or
<i>pthread_cond_timedwait</i>(). The thread(s) that are
unblocked shall contend for the mutex according to the
scheduling policy (if applicable), and as if each had called
<i>pthread_mutex_lock</i>().</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>pthread_cond_broadcast</i>() or
<i>pthread_cond_signal</i>() functions may be called by a
thread whether or not it currently owns the mutex that
threads calling <i>pthread_cond_wait</i>() or
<i>pthread_cond_timedwait</i>() have associated with the
condition variable during their waits; however, if
predictable scheduling behavior is required, then that mutex
shall be locked by the thread calling
<i>pthread_cond_broadcast</i>() or
<i>pthread_cond_signal</i>().</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>pthread_cond_broadcast</i>() and
<i>pthread_cond_signal</i>() functions shall have no effect
if there are no threads currently blocked on
<i>cond</i>.</p>

<h2>RETURN VALUE
<a name="RETURN VALUE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If successful,
the <i>pthread_cond_broadcast</i>() and
<i>pthread_cond_signal</i>() functions shall return zero;
otherwise, an error number shall be returned to indicate the
error.</p>

<h2>ERRORS
<a name="ERRORS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The

<h2>EXAMPLES
<a name="EXAMPLES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">None.</p>

<h2>APPLICATION USAGE
<a name="APPLICATION USAGE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>pthread_cond_broadcast</i>() function is used whenever
the shared-variable state has been changed in a way that
more than one thread can proceed with its task. Consider a
single producer/multiple consumer problem, where the
producer can insert multiple items on a list that is
accessed one item at a time by the consumers. By calling the
<i>pthread_cond_broadcast</i>() function, the producer would
notify all consumers that might be waiting, and thereby the
application would receive more throughput on a
multi-processor. In addition,
<i>pthread_cond_broadcast</i>() makes it easier to implement
a read-write lock. The <i>pthread_cond_broadcast</i>()
function is needed in order to wake up all waiting readers
when a writer releases its lock. Finally, the two-phase
commit algorithm can use this broadcast function to notify
all clients of an impending transaction commit.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is not safe
to use the <i>pthread_cond_signal</i>() function in a signal
handler that is invoked asynchronously. Even if it were
safe, there would still be a race between the test of the
Boolean <i>pthread_cond_wait</i>() that could not be
efficiently eliminated.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Mutexes and
condition variables are thus not suitable for releasing a
waiting thread by signaling from code running in a signal
handler.</p>

<h2>RATIONALE
<a name="RATIONALE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Multiple
Awakenings by Condition Signal</b> <br>
On a multi-processor, it may be impossible for an
implementation of <i>pthread_cond_signal</i>() to avoid the
unblocking of more than one thread blocked on a condition
variable. For example, consider the following partial
implementation of <i>pthread_cond_wait</i>() and
<i>pthread_cond_signal</i>(), executed by two threads in the
order given. One thread is trying to wait on the condition
variable, another is concurrently executing
<i>pthread_cond_signal</i>(), while a third thread is
already waiting.</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>pthread_cond_wait(mutex,
cond): <br>
value = cond-&gt;value; /* 1 */ <br>
pthread_mutex_unlock(mutex); /* 2 */ <br>
pthread_mutex_lock(cond-&gt;mutex); /* 10 */ <br>
if (value == cond-&gt;value) { /* 11 */ <br>
me-&gt;next_cond = cond-&gt;waiter; <br>
cond-&gt;waiter = me; <br>
pthread_mutex_unlock(cond-&gt;mutex); <br>
unable_to_run(me); <br>
} else <br>
pthread_mutex_unlock(cond-&gt;mutex); /* 12 */ <br>
pthread_mutex_lock(mutex); /* 13 */</b></p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>pthread_cond_signal(cond):
<br>
pthread_mutex_lock(cond-&gt;mutex); /* 3 */ <br>
cond-&gt;value++; /* 4 */ <br>
if (cond-&gt;waiter) { /* 5 */ <br>
sleeper = cond-&gt;waiter; /* 6 */ <br>
cond-&gt;waiter = sleeper-&gt;next_cond; /* 7 */ <br>
able_to_run(sleeper); /* 8 */ <br>
} <br>
pthread_mutex_unlock(cond-&gt;mutex); /* 9 */</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The effect is
that more than one thread can return from its call to
<i>pthread_cond_wait</i>() or
<i>pthread_cond_timedwait</i>() as a result of one call to
<i>pthread_cond_signal</i>(). This effect is called
&quot;spurious wakeup&quot;. Note that the situation is
self-correcting in that the number of threads that are so
awakened is finite; for example, the next thread to call
<i>pthread_cond_wait</i>() after the sequence of events
above blocks.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">While this
problem could be resolved, the loss of efficiency for a
fringe condition that occurs only rarely is unacceptable,
especially given that one has to check the predicate
associated with a condition variable anyway. Correcting this
problem would unnecessarily reduce the degree of concurrency
in this basic building block for all higher-level
synchronization operations.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">An added
benefit of allowing spurious wakeups is that applications
are forced to code a predicate-testing-loop around the
condition wait. This also makes the application tolerate
superfluous condition broadcasts or signals on the same
condition variable that may be coded in some other part of
the application. The resulting applications are thus more
robust. Therefore, IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 explicitly
documents that spurious wakeups may occur.</p>
