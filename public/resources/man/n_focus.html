<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>focus</b> command is used to manage the Tk input focus.
At any given time, one window on each display is designated
as the <i>focus window</i>; any key press or key release
events for the display are sent to that window. It is
normally up to the window manager to redirect the focus
among the top-level windows of a display. For example, some
window managers automatically set the input focus to a
top-level window whenever the mouse enters it; others
redirect the input focus only when the user clicks on a
window. Usually the window manager will set the focus only
to top-level windows, leaving it up to the application to
redirect the focus among the children of the top-level.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Tk remembers
one focus window for each top-level (the most recent
descendant of that top-level to receive the focus); when the
window manager gives the focus to a top-level, Tk
automatically redirects it to the remembered window. Within
a top-level Tk uses an <i>explicit</i> focus model by
default. Moving the mouse within a top-level does not
normally change the focus; the focus changes only when a
widget decides explicitly to claim the focus (e.g., because
of a button click), or when the user types a key such as Tab
that moves the focus.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The Tcl
procedure <b>tk_focusFollowsMouse</b> may be invoked to
create an <i>implicit</i> focus model: it reconfigures Tk so
that the focus is set to a window whenever the mouse enters
it. The Tcl procedures <b>tk_focusNext</b> and
<b>tk_focusPrev</b> implement a focus order among the
windows of a top-level; they are used in the default
bindings for Tab and Shift-Tab, among other things.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>focus</b> command can take any of the following
forms:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="7%">


<p><b>focus</b></p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>Returns the path name of the focus window on the display
containing the application&rsquo;s main window, or an empty
string if no window in this application has the focus on
that display. Note: it is better to specify the display
explicitly using <b>&minus;displayof</b> (see below) so that
the code will work in applications using multiple
displays.</p> </td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>focus</b> <i>window</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If the application currently
has the input focus on <i>window</i>&rsquo;s display, this
command resets the input focus for <i>window</i>&rsquo;s
display to <i>window</i> and returns an empty string. If the
application does not currently have the input focus on
<i>window</i>&rsquo;s display, <i>window</i> will be
remembered as the focus for its top-level; the next time the
focus arrives at the top-level, Tk will redirect it to
<i>window</i>. If <i>window</i> is an empty string then the
command does nothing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>focus &minus;displayof</b>
<i>window</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Returns the name of the focus
window on the display containing <i>window</i>. If the focus
window for <i>window</i>&rsquo;s display is not in this
application, the return value is an empty string.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>focus &minus;force</b>
<i>window</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Sets the focus of
<i>window</i>&rsquo;s display to <i>window</i>, even if the
application does not currently have the input focus for the
display. This command should be used sparingly, if at all.
In normal usage, an application should not claim the focus
for itself; instead, it should wait for the window manager
to give it the focus. If <i>window</i> is an empty string
then the command does nothing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>focus &minus;lastfor</b>
<i>window</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Returns the name of the most
recent window to have the input focus among all the windows
in the same top-level as <i>window</i>. If no window in that
top-level has ever had the input focus, or if the most
recent focus window has been deleted, then the name of the
top-level is returned. The return value is the window that
will receive the input focus the next time the window
manager gives the focus to the top-level.</p>

<h2>QUIRKS
<a name="QUIRKS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When an
internal window receives the input focus, Tk does not
actually set the X focus to that window; as far as X is
concerned, the focus will stay on the top-level window
containing the window with the focus. However, Tk generates
FocusIn and FocusOut events just as if the X focus were on
the internal window. This approach gets around a number of
problems that would occur if the X focus were actually
moved; the fact that the X focus is on the top-level is
invisible unless you use C code to query the X server
directly.</p>

<h2>EXAMPLE
<a name="EXAMPLE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To make a
window that only participates in the focus traversal ring
when a variable is set, add the following bindings to the
widgets <i>before</i> and <i>after</i> it in that focus
ring:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">button .before &minus;text
&quot;Before&quot; <br>
button .middle &minus;text &quot;Middle&quot; <br>
button .after &minus;text &quot;After&quot; <br>
checkbutton .flag &minus;variable traverseToMiddle
&minus;takefocus 0 <br>
pack .flag &minus;side left <br>
pack .before .middle .after <br>
bind .before &lt;Tab&gt; { <br>
if {!$traverseToMiddle} { <b><br>
focus</b> .after <br>
break <br>
} <br>
} <br>
bind .after &lt;Shift&minus;Tab&gt; { <br>
if {!$traverseToMiddle} { <b><br>
focus</b> .before <br>
break <br>
} <br>
} <b><br>
focus</b> .before</p>
