<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Process ID
(PID)</b> <br>
Each process has a unique nonnegative integer identifier
that is assigned when the process is created using
<b>fork</b>(2). A process can obtain its PID using
<b>getpid</b>(2). A PID is represented using the type
<i>pid_t</i> (defined in <i>&lt;sys/types.h&gt;</i>).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">PIDs are used
in a range of system calls to identify the process affected
by the call, for example: <b>kill</b>(2), <b>ptrace</b>(2),
<b>setpriority</b>(2) <b>setpgid</b>(2), <b>setsid</b>(2),
<b>sigqueue</b>(3), and <b>waitpid</b>(2).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A
process&rsquo;s PID is preserved across an
<b>execve</b>(2).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Parent
process ID (PPID)</b> <br>
A process&rsquo;s parent process ID identifies the process
that created this process using <b>fork</b>(2). A process
can obtain its PPID using <b>getppid</b>(2). A PPID is
represented using the type <i>pid_t</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A
process&rsquo;s PPID is preserved across an
<b>execve</b>(2).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Process
group ID and session ID</b> <br>
Each process has a session ID and a process group ID, both
represented using the type <i>pid_t</i>. A process can
obtain its session ID using <b>getsid</b>(2), and its
process group ID using <b>getpgrp</b>(2).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A child created
by <b>fork</b>(2) inherits its parent&rsquo;s session ID and
process group ID. A process&rsquo;s session ID and process
group ID are preserved across an <b>execve</b>(2).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Sessions and
process groups are abstractions devised to support shell job
control. A process group (sometimes called a
&quot;job&quot;) is a collection of processes that share the
same process group ID; the shell creates a new process group
for the process(es) used to execute single command or
pipeline (e.g., the two processes created to execute the
command &quot;ls&nbsp;|&nbsp;wc&quot; are placed in the same
process group). A process&rsquo;s group membership can be
set using <b>setpgid</b>(2). The process whose process ID is
the same as its process group ID is the <i>process group
leader</i> for that group.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A session is a
collection of processes that share the same session ID. All
of the members of a process group also have the same session
ID (i.e., all of the members of a process group always
belong to the same session, so that sessions and process
groups form a strict two-level hierarchy of processes.) A
new session is created when a process calls
<b>setsid</b>(2), which creates a new session whose session
ID is the same as the PID of the process that called
<b>setsid</b>(2). The creator of the session is called the
<i>session leader</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>User and
group identifiers</b> <br>
Each process has various associated user and groups IDs.
These IDs are integers, respectively represented using the
types <i>uid_t</i> and <i>gid_t</i> (defined in
<i>&lt;sys/types.h&gt;</i>).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On Linux, each
process has the following user and group identifiers:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>*</p></td>
<td width="3%"></td>
<td width="85%">


<p>Real user ID and real group ID. These IDs determine who
owns the process. A process can obtain its real user (group)
ID using <b>getuid</b>(2) (<b>getgid</b>(2)).</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>*</p></td>
<td width="3%"></td>
<td width="85%">


<p>Effective user ID and effective group ID. These IDs are
used by the kernel to determine the permissions that the
process will have when accessing shared resources such as
message queues, shared memory, and semaphores. On most UNIX
systems, these IDs also determine the permissions when
accessing files. However, Linux uses the file system IDs
described below for this task. A process can obtain its
effective user (group) ID using <b>geteuid</b>(2)
(<b>getegid</b>(2)).</p> </td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>*</p></td>
<td width="3%"></td>
<td width="85%">


<p>Saved set-user-ID and saved set-group-ID. These IDs are
used in set-user-ID and set-group-ID programs to save a copy
of the corresponding effective IDs that were set when the
program was executed (see <b>execve</b>(2)). A set-user-ID
program can assume and drop privileges by switching its
effective user ID back and forth between the values in its
real user ID and saved set-user-ID. This switching is done
via calls to <b>seteuid</b>(2), <b>setreuid</b>(2), or
<b>setresuid</b>(2). A set-group-ID program performs the
analogous tasks using <b>setegid</b>(2), <b>setregid</b>(2),
or <b>setresgid</b>(2). A process can obtain its saved
set-user-ID (set-group-ID) using <b>getresuid</b>(2)
(<b>getresgid</b>(2)).</p> </td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>*</p></td>
<td width="3%"></td>
<td width="85%">


<p>File system user ID and file system group ID
(Linux-specific). These IDs, in conjunction with the
supplementary group IDs described below, are used to
determine permissions for accessing files; see
<b>path_resolution</b>(7) for details. Whenever a
process&rsquo;s effective user (group) ID is changed, the
kernel also automatically changes the file system user
(group) ID to the same value. Consequently, the file system
IDs normally have the same values as the corresponding
effective ID, and the semantics for file-permission checks
are thus the same on Linux as on other UNIX systems. The
file system IDs can be made to differ from the effective IDs
by calling <b>setfsuid</b>(2) and <b>setfsgid</b>(2).</p></td></tr>

<td width="11%"></td>

<p>*</p></td>
<td width="3%"></td>
<td width="85%">


<p>Supplementary group IDs. This is a set of additional
group IDs that are used for permission checks when accessing
files and other shared resources. On Linux kernels before
2.6.4, a process can be a member of up to 32 supplementary
groups; since kernel 2.6.4, a process can be a member of up
to 65536 supplementary groups. The call
<i>sysconf(_SC_NGROUPS_MAX)</i> can be used to determine the
number of supplementary groups of which a process may be a
member. A process can obtain its set of supplementary group
IDs using <b>getgroups</b>(2), and can modify the set using
<b>setgroups</b>(2).</p> </td></tr>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A child process
created by <b>fork</b>(2) inherits copies of its
parent&rsquo;s user and groups IDs. During an
<b>execve</b>(2), a process&rsquo;s real user and group ID

saved set IDs may be changed, as described in
<b>execve</b>(2).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Aside from the
purposes noted above, a process&rsquo;s user IDs are also

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Process IDs,
parent process IDs, process group IDs, and session IDs are
specified in POSIX.1-2001. The real, effective, and saved
set user and groups IDs, and the supplementary group IDs,
are specified in POSIX.1-2001. The file system user and
group IDs are a Linux extension.</p>

<h2>NOTES

</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The POSIX
threads specification requires that credentials are shared
by all of the threads in a process. However, at the kernel
level, Linux maintains separate user and group credentials
for each thread. The NPTL threading implementation does some
work to ensure that any change to user or group credentials
(e.g., calls to <b>setuid</b>(2), <b>setresuid</b>(2)) is
carried through to all of the POSIX threads in a
process.</p>
