<h2>INTRODUCTION
<a name="INTRODUCTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This man page
presents an overview of Tcl objects and how they are used.
It also describes generic procedures for managing Tcl
objects. These procedures are used to create and copy
objects, and increment and decrement the count of references
(pointers) to objects. The procedures are used in
conjunction with ones that operate on specific types of
objects such as <b>Tcl_GetIntFromObj</b> and
<b>Tcl_ListObjAppendElement</b>. The individual procedures
are described along with the data structures they
manipulate.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Tcl&rsquo;s
<i>dual-ported</i> objects provide a general-purpose
mechanism for storing and exchanging Tcl values. They
largely replace the use of strings in Tcl. For example, they
are used to store variable values, command arguments,
command results, and scripts. Tcl objects behave like
strings but also hold an internal representation that can be
manipulated more efficiently. For example, a Tcl list is now
represented as an object that holds the list&rsquo;s string
representation as well as an array of pointers to the
objects for each list element. Dual-ported objects avoid
most runtime type conversions. They also improve the speed
of many operations since an appropriate representation is
immediately available. The compiler itself uses Tcl objects
to cache the instruction bytecodes resulting from compiling
scripts.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The two
representations are a cache of each other and are computed
lazily. That is, each representation is only computed when
necessary, it is computed from the other representation,
and, once computed, it is saved. In addition, a change in
one representation invalidates the other one. As an example,
a Tcl program doing integer calculations can operate
directly on a variable&rsquo;s internal machine integer
representation without having to constantly convert between
integers and strings. Only when it needs a string
representing the variable&rsquo;s value, say to print it,
will the program regenerate the string representation from
the integer. Although objects contain an internal
representation, their semantics are defined in terms of
strings: an up-to-date string can always be obtained, and
any change to the object will be reflected in that string
when the object&rsquo;s string representation is fetched.
Because of this representation invalidation and
regeneration, it is dangerous for extension writers to
access <b>Tcl_Obj</b> fields directly. It is better to
access Tcl_Obj information using procedures like
<b>Tcl_GetStringFromObj</b> and <b>Tcl_GetString</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Objects are
allocated on the heap and are referenced using a pointer to
their <b>Tcl_Obj</b> structure. Objects are shared as much
as possible. This significantly reduces storage requirements
because some objects such as long lists are very large.
Also, most Tcl values are only read and never modified. This
is especially true for procedure arguments, which can be
shared between the caller and the called procedure.
Assignment and argument binding is done by simply assigning
a pointer to the value. Reference counting is used to
determine when it is safe to reclaim an object&rsquo;s
storage.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Tcl objects are
typed. An object&rsquo;s internal representation is
controlled by its type. Several types are predefined in the
Tcl core including integer, double, list, and bytecode.
Extension writers can extend the set of types by defining
their own <b>Tcl_ObjType</b> structs.</p>

<h2>THE TCL_OBJ STRUCTURE
<a name="THE TCL_OBJ STRUCTURE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Each Tcl object
is represented by a <b>Tcl_Obj</b> structure which is
defined as follows.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">typedef struct Tcl_Obj { <br>
int <i>refCount</i>; <br>
char *<i>bytes</i>; <br>
int <i>length</i>; <br>
Tcl_ObjType *<i>typePtr</i>; <br>
union { <br>
long <i>longValue</i>; <br>
double <i>doubleValue</i>; <br>
void *<i>otherValuePtr</i>; <br>
Tcl_WideInt <i>wideValue</i>; <br>
struct { <br>
void *<i>ptr1</i>; <br>
void *<i>ptr2</i>; <br>
} <i>twoPtrValue</i>; <br>
struct { <br>
void *<i>ptr</i>; <br>
unsigned long <i>value</i>; <br>
} <i>ptrAndLongRep</i>; <br>
} <i>internalRep</i>; <br>
} Tcl_Obj;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">The <i>bytes</i> and the
<i>length</i> members together hold an object&rsquo;s UTF-8
string representation, which is a <i>counted string</i> not
containing null bytes (UTF-8 null characters should be
encoded as a two byte sequence: 192, 128.) <i>bytes</i>
points to the first byte of the string representation. The
<i>length</i> member gives the number of bytes. The byte
array must always have a null byte after the last data byte,
at offset <i>length</i>; this allows string representations
to be treated as conventional null-terminated C strings. C
programs use <b>Tcl_GetStringFromObj</b> and
<b>Tcl_GetString</b> to get an object&rsquo;s string
representation. If <i>bytes</i> is NULL, the string
representation is invalid.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">An
object&rsquo;s type manages its internal representation. The
member <i>typePtr</i> points to the Tcl_ObjType structure
that describes the type. If <i>typePtr</i> is NULL, the
internal representation is invalid.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>internalRep</i> union member holds an object&rsquo;s
internal representation. This is either a (long) integer, a
double-precision floating-point number, a pointer to a value
containing additional information needed by the
object&rsquo;s type to represent the object, a Tcl_WideInt
integer, two arbitrary pointers, or a pair made up of an
unsigned long integer and a pointer.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>refCount</i> member is used to tell when it is safe to
free an object&rsquo;s storage. It holds the count of active
references to the object. Maintaining the correct reference
count is a key responsibility of extension writers.
Reference counting is discussed below in the section
<b>STORAGE MANAGEMENT OF OBJECTS</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Although
extension writers can directly access the members of a
Tcl_Obj structure, it is much better to use the appropriate
procedures and macros. For example, extension writers should
never read or update <i>refCount</i> directly; they should
use macros such as <b>Tcl_IncrRefCount</b> and
<b>Tcl_IsShared</b> instead.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A key property
of Tcl objects is that they hold two representations. An
object typically starts out containing only a string
representation: it is untyped and has a NULL <i>typePtr</i>.
An object containing an empty string or a copy of a
specified string is created using <b>Tcl_NewObj</b> or
<b>Tcl_NewStringObj</b> respectively. An object&rsquo;s
string value is gotten with <b>Tcl_GetStringFromObj</b> or
<b>Tcl_GetString</b> and changed with
<b>Tcl_SetStringObj</b>. If the object is later passed to a
procedure like <b>Tcl_GetIntFromObj</b> that requires a
specific internal representation, the procedure will create
one and set the object&rsquo;s <i>typePtr</i>. The internal
representation is computed from the string representation.
An object&rsquo;s two representations are duals of each
other: changes made to one are reflected in the other. For
example, <b>Tcl_ListObjReplace</b> will modify an
object&rsquo;s internal representation and the next call to
<b>Tcl_GetStringFromObj</b> or <b>Tcl_GetString</b> will
reflect that change.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Representations
are recomputed lazily for efficiency. A change to one
representation made by a procedure such as
<b>Tcl_ListObjReplace</b> is not reflected immediately in
the other representation. Instead, the other representation
is marked invalid so that it is only regenerated if it is
needed later. Most C programmers never have to be concerned
with how this is done and simply use procedures such as
<b>Tcl_GetBooleanFromObj</b> or <b>Tcl_ListObjIndex</b>.
Programmers that implement their own object types must check
for invalid representations and mark representations invalid
when necessary. The procedure <b>Tcl_InvalidateStringRep</b>
is used to mark an object&rsquo;s string representation
invalid and to free any storage associated with the old
string representation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Objects usually
remain one type over their life, but occasionally an object
must be converted from one type to another. For example, a C
program might build up a string in an object with repeated
calls to <b>Tcl_AppendToObj</b>, and then call
<b>Tcl_ListObjIndex</b> to extract a list element from the
object. The same object holding the same string value can
have several different internal representations at different
times. Extension writers can also force an object to be
converted from one type to another using the
<b>Tcl_ConvertToType</b> procedure. Only programmers that
create new object types need to be concerned about how this
is done. A procedure defined as part of the object
type&rsquo;s implementation creates a new internal
representation for an object and changes its <i>typePtr</i>.
See the man page for <b>Tcl_RegisterObjType</b> to see how
to create a new object type.</p>

<h2>EXAMPLE OF THE LIFETIME OF AN OBJECT
<a name="EXAMPLE OF THE LIFETIME OF AN OBJECT"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As an example
of the lifetime of an object, consider the following
sequence of commands:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>set x 123</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">This assigns to <i>x</i> an
untyped object whose <i>bytes</i> member points to
<b>123</b> and <i>length</i> member contains 3. The
object&rsquo;s <i>typePtr</i> member is NULL.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>puts &quot;x is
$x&quot;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>x</i>&rsquo;s string
representation is valid (since <i>bytes</i> is non-NULL) and
is fetched for the command.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>incr x</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">The <b>incr</b> command first
gets an integer from <i>x</i>&rsquo;s object by calling
<b>Tcl_GetIntFromObj</b>. This procedure checks whether the
object is already an integer object. Since it is not, it
converts the object by setting the object&rsquo;s
<i>internalRep.longValue</i> member to the integer
<b>123</b> and setting the object&rsquo;s <i>typePtr</i> to
point to the integer Tcl_ObjType structure. Both
representations are now valid. <b>incr</b> increments the
object&rsquo;s integer internal representation then
invalidates its string representation (by calling
<b>Tcl_InvalidateStringRep</b>) since the string
representation no longer corresponds to the internal
representation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>puts &quot;x is now
$x&quot;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">The string representation of
<i>x</i>&rsquo;s object is needed and is recomputed. The
string representation is now <b>124</b> and both
representations are again valid.</p>

<h2>STORAGE MANAGEMENT OF OBJECTS
<a name="STORAGE MANAGEMENT OF OBJECTS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Tcl objects are
allocated on the heap and are shared as much as possible to
reduce storage requirements. Reference counting is used to
determine when an object is no longer needed and can safely
be freed. An object just created by <b>Tcl_NewObj</b> or
<b>Tcl_NewStringObj</b> has <i>refCount</i> 0. The macro
<b>Tcl_IncrRefCount</b> increments the reference count when
a new reference to the object is created. The macro
<b>Tcl_DecrRefCount</b> decrements the count when a
reference is no longer needed and, if the object&rsquo;s
reference count drops to zero, frees its storage. An object
shared by different code or data structures has
<i>refCount</i> greater than 1. Incrementing an
object&rsquo;s reference count ensures that it will not be
freed too early or have its value change accidentally.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As an example,
the bytecode interpreter shares argument objects between
calling and called Tcl procedures to avoid having to copy
objects. It assigns the call&rsquo;s argument objects to the
procedure&rsquo;s formal parameter variables. In doing so,
it calls <b>Tcl_IncrRefCount</b> to increment the reference
count of each argument since there is now a new reference to
it from the formal parameter. When the called procedure
returns, the interpreter calls <b>Tcl_DecrRefCount</b> to
decrement each argument&rsquo;s reference count. When an
object&rsquo;s reference count drops less than or equal to
zero, <b>Tcl_DecrRefCount</b> reclaims its storage. Most
command procedures do not have to be concerned about
reference counting since they use an object&rsquo;s value
immediately and do not retain a pointer to the object after
they return. However, if they do retain a pointer to an
object in a data structure, they must be careful to
increment its reference count since the retained pointer is
a new reference.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Command
procedures that directly modify objects such as those for
<b>lappend</b> and <b>linsert</b> must be careful to copy a
shared object before changing it. They must first check
whether the object is shared by calling <b>Tcl_IsShared</b>.
If the object is shared they must copy the object by using
<b>Tcl_DuplicateObj</b>; this returns a new duplicate of the
original object that has <i>refCount</i> 0. If the object is
not shared, the command procedure &ldquo;owns&rdquo; the
object and can safely modify it directly. For example, the
following code appears in the command procedure that
implements <b>linsert</b>. This procedure modifies the list
object passed to it in <i>objv[1]</i> by inserting
<i>objc-3</i> new elements before <i>index</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">listPtr =
objv[1]; <br>
if (Tcl_IsShared(listPtr)) { <br>
listPtr = Tcl_DuplicateObj(listPtr); <br>
} <br>
result = Tcl_ListObjReplace(interp, listPtr, index, 0, <br>
(objc-3), &amp;(objv[3]));</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As another
example, <b>incr</b>&rsquo;s command procedure must check
whether the variable&rsquo;s object is shared before
incrementing the integer in its internal representation. If
it is shared, it needs to duplicate the object in order to
avoid accidentally changing values in other data
structures.</p>
