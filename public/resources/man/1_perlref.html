Perl references and nested data structures</p>

<h2>NOTE
<a name="NOTE"></a>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This is
complete documentation about all aspects of references. For
a shorter, tutorial introduction to just the essential
features, see perlreftut.</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Before release
5 of Perl it was difficult to represent complex data
structures, because all references had to be symbolic--and
even then it was difficult to refer to a variable instead of
a symbol table entry. Perl now not only makes it easier to
use symbolic references to variables, but also lets you have
&quot;hard&quot; references to any piece of data or code.
Any scalar may hold a hard reference. Because arrays and
hashes contain scalars, you can now easily build arrays of
arrays, arrays of hashes, hashes of arrays, arrays of hashes
of functions, and so on.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Hard references
are smart--they keep track of reference counts for you,
automatically freeing the thing referred to when its
reference count goes to zero. (Reference counts for values
in self-referential or cyclic data structures may not go to
zero without a little help; see &quot;Circular
References&quot; for a detailed explanation.) If that thing
happens to be an object, the object is destructed. See
perlobj for more about objects. (In a sense, everything in
Perl is an object, but we usually reserve the word for
references to objects that have been officially
&quot;blessed&quot; into a class package.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Symbolic
references are names of variables or other objects, just as
a symbolic link in a Unix filesystem contains merely the
name of a file. The <tt>*glob</tt> notation is something of
a symbolic reference. (Symbolic references are sometimes
called &quot;soft references&quot;, but please don&rsquo;t
call them that; references are confusing enough without
useless synonyms.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In contrast,
hard references are more like hard links in a Unix file
system: They are used to access an underlying object without
concern for what its (other) name is. When the word
&quot;reference&quot; is used without an adjective, as in
the following paragraph, it is usually talking about a hard
reference.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">References are
easy to use in Perl. There is just one overriding principle:
Perl does no implicit referencing or dereferencing. When a
scalar is holding a reference, it always behaves as a simple
scalar. It doesn&rsquo;t magically start being an array or
hash or subroutine; you have to tell it explicitly to do so,
by dereferencing it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">References are
easy to use in Perl. There is just one overriding principle:
in general, Perl does no implicit referencing or
dereferencing. When a scalar is holding a reference, it
always behaves as a simple scalar. It doesn&rsquo;t
magically start being an array or hash or subroutine; you
have to tell it explicitly to do so, by dereferencing
it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">That said, be
aware that Perl version 5.14 introduces an exception to the
rule, for syntactic convenience. Experimental array and hash
container function behavior allows array and hash references
to be handled by Perl as if they had been explicitly
syntactically dereferenced. See &quot;Syntactical
Enhancements&quot; in perl5140delta and perlfunc for
details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Making
References</b> <br>
References can be created in several ways.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p>1.</p></td>
<td width="3%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>By using the backslash operator on a variable,
subroutine, or value. (This works much like the &amp;
(address-of) operator in C.) This typically creates
<i>another</i> reference to a variable, because
there&rsquo;s already a reference to the variable in the
symbol table. But the symbol table reference might go away,
and you&rsquo;ll still have the reference that the backslash
returned. Here are some examples:</p></td></tr>
</table>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    $scalarref = \$foo;
    $arrayref  = \@ARGV;
    $hashref   = \%ENV;
    $coderef   = \&amp;handler;
    $globref   = \*foo;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">It isn&rsquo;t
possible to create a true reference to an <small>IO</small>
handle (filehandle or dirhandle) using the backslash
operator. The most you can get is a reference to a typeglob,
which is actually a complete symbol table entry. But see the
explanation of the <tt>*foo{THING}</tt> syntax below.
However, you can still use type globs and globrefs as though
they were <small>IO</small> handles.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">2.</p></td>
<td width="3%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">A reference to an anonymous
array can be created using square brackets:</p></td></tr>
</table>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    $arrayref = [1, 2, ['a', 'b', 'c']];</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Here
we&rsquo;ve created a reference to an anonymous array of
three elements whose final element is itself a reference to
another anonymous array of three elements. (The
multidimensional syntax described later can be used to
access this. For example, after the above,
<tt>&quot;$arrayref&minus;&gt;[2][1]&quot;</tt> would have
the value &quot;b&quot;.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Taking a
reference to an enumerated list is not the same as using
square brackets--instead it&rsquo;s the same as creating a
list of references!</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    @list = (\$a, \@b, \%c);
    @list = \($a, @b, %c);      # same thing!</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">As a special
case, <tt>&quot;\(@foo)&quot;</tt> returns a list of
references to the contents of <tt>@foo</tt>, not a reference
to <tt>@foo</tt> itself. Likewise for <tt>%foo</tt>, except
that the key references are to copies (since the keys are
just strings rather than full-fledged scalars).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">A reference to an anonymous hash
can be created using curly brackets:</p></td></tr>
</table>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    $hashref = {
        'Adam'  =&gt; 'Eve',
        'Clyde' =&gt; 'Bonnie',
    };</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Anonymous hash
and array composers like these can be intermixed freely to
produce as complicated a structure as you want. The
multidimensional syntax described below works for these too.
The values above are literals, but variables and expressions
would work just as well, because assignment operators in
Perl (even within <i>local()</i> or <i>my()</i>) are
executable statements, not compile-time declarations.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Because curly
brackets (braces) are used for several other things
including BLOCKs, you may occasionally have to disambiguate
braces at the beginning of a statement by putting a
<tt>&quot;+&quot;</tt> or a <tt>&quot;return&quot;</tt> in
front so that Perl realizes the opening brace isn&rsquo;t
starting a <small>BLOCK</small> . The economy and mnemonic
value of using curlies is deemed worth this occasional extra
hassle.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">For example, if
you wanted a function to make a new hash and return a
reference to it, you have these options:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    sub hashem {        { @_ } }   # silently wrong
    sub hashem {       +{ @_ } }   # ok
    sub hashem { return { @_ } }   # ok</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">On the other
hand, if you want the other meaning, you can do this:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    sub showem {        { @_ } }   # ambiguous (currently ok, but may change)
    sub showem {       {; @_ } }   # ok
    sub showem { { return @_ } }   # ok</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The leading
<tt>&quot;+{&quot;</tt> and <tt>&quot;{;&quot;</tt> always
serve to disambiguate the expression to mean either the
<small>HASH</small> reference, or the <small>BLOCK</small>
.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

<td width="3%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">A reference to an anonymous
subroutine can be created by using <tt>&quot;sub&quot;</tt>
without a subname:</p></td></tr>
</table>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    $coderef = sub { print &quot;Boink!\n&quot; };</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note the
semicolon. Except for the code inside not being immediately
executed, a <tt>&quot;sub {}&quot;</tt> is not so much a
declaration as it is an operator, like
<tt>&quot;do{}&quot;</tt> or <tt>&quot;eval{}&quot;</tt>.
(However, no matter how many times you execute that
particular line (unless you&rsquo;re in an
<tt>&quot;eval(&quot;...&quot;)&quot;</tt>),
<tt>$coderef</tt> will still have a reference to the
<i>same</i> anonymous subroutine.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Anonymous
subroutines act as closures with respect to <i>my()</i>
variables, that is, variables lexically visible within the
current scope. Closure is a notion out of the Lisp world
that says if you define an anonymous function in a
particular lexical context, it pretends to run in that
context even when it&rsquo;s called outside the context.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">In human terms,
it&rsquo;s a funny way of passing arguments to a subroutine
when you define it as well as when you call it. It&rsquo;s
useful for setting up little bits of code to run later, such
as callbacks. You can even do object-oriented stuff with it,
though Perl already provides a different mechanism to do
that--see perlobj.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">You might also
think of closure as a way to write a subroutine template
without using <i>eval()</i>. Here&rsquo;s a small example of
how closures work:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    sub newprint {
        my $x = shift;
        return sub { my $y = shift; print &quot;$x, $y!\n&quot;; };
    }
    $h = newprint(&quot;Howdy&quot;);
    $g = newprint(&quot;Greetings&quot;);
    # Time passes...
    &amp;$h(&quot;world&quot;);
    &amp;$g(&quot;earthlings&quot;);</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This prints</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    Howdy, world!
    Greetings, earthlings!</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note
particularly that <tt>$x</tt> continues to refer to the
value passed into <i>newprint() despite</i> &quot;my
<tt>$x</tt>&quot; having gone out of scope by the time the
anonymous subroutine runs. That&rsquo;s what a closure is
all about.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This applies
only to lexical variables, by the way. Dynamic variables
continue to work as they have always worked. Closure is not
something that most Perl programmers need trouble themselves
about to begin with.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">References are often returned by
special subroutines called constructors. Perl objects are
just references to a special type of object that happens to
know which package it&rsquo;s associated with. Constructors
are just special subroutines that know how to create that
association. They do so by starting with an ordinary
reference, and it remains an ordinary reference even while
it&rsquo;s also being an object. Constructors are often
named <tt>&quot;new()&quot;</tt>. You <i>can</i> call them
indirectly:</p> </td></tr>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    $objref = new Doggie( Tail =&gt; 'short', Ears =&gt; 'long' );</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">But that can
produce ambiguous syntax in certain cases, so it&rsquo;s
often better to use the direct method invocation
approach:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    $objref   = Doggie&minus;&gt;new(Tail =&gt; 'short', Ears =&gt; 'long');

<p>A reference can be created by using a special syntax,
lovingly known as the *foo{ <small>THING</small> } syntax.
*foo{ <small>THING</small> } returns a reference to the
<small>THING</small> slot in *foo (which is the symbol table
entry which holds everything known as foo).</p></td></tr>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    $scalarref = *foo{SCALAR};

    $coderef   = *handler{CODE};
    $ioref     = *STDIN{IO};
    $globref   = *foo{GLOB};
    $formatref = *foo{FORMAT};</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">All of these
are self-explanatory except for <tt>*foo{IO}</tt>. It
returns the <small>IO</small> handle, used for file handles
(&quot;open&quot; in perlfunc), sockets (&quot;socket&quot;
in perlfunc and &quot;socketpair&quot; in perlfunc), and
directory handles (&quot;opendir&quot; in perlfunc). For
compatibility with previous versions of Perl,
<tt>*foo{FILEHANDLE}</tt> is a synonym for
<tt>*foo{IO}</tt>, though it is deprecated as of 5.8.0. If
deprecation warnings are in effect, it will warn of its
use.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><tt>*foo{THING}</tt>
returns undef if that particular <small>THING</small>
hasn&rsquo;t been used yet, except in the case of scalars.
<tt>*foo{SCALAR}</tt> returns a reference to an anonymous
scalar if <tt>$foo</tt> hasn&rsquo;t been used yet. This
might change in a future release.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><tt>*foo{IO}</tt>
is an alternative to the <tt>*HANDLE</tt> mechanism given in
&quot;Typeglobs and Filehandles&quot; in perldata for
passing filehandles into or out of subroutines, or storing
into larger data structures. Its disadvantage is that it
won&rsquo;t create a new filehandle for you. Its advantage
is that you have less risk of clobbering more than you want
to with a typeglob assignment. (It still conflates file and
directory handles, though.) However, if you assign the
incoming value to a scalar instead of a typeglob as we do in
the examples below, there&rsquo;s no risk of that
happening.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    splutter(*STDOUT);          # pass the whole glob
    splutter(*STDOUT{IO});      # pass both file and dir handles
    sub splutter {
        my $fh = shift;
        print $fh &quot;her um well a hmmm\n&quot;;
    }
    $rec = get_rec(*STDIN);     # pass the whole glob
    $rec = get_rec(*STDIN{IO}); # pass both file and dir handles
    sub get_rec {
        my $fh = shift;
        return scalar &lt;$fh&gt;;
    }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Using
References</b> <br>
That&rsquo;s it for creating references. By now you&rsquo;re
probably dying to know how to use references to get back to
your long-lost data. There are several basic methods.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Anywhere you&rsquo;d put an
identifier (or chain of identifiers) as part of a variable
or subroutine name, you can replace the identifier with a
simple scalar variable containing a reference of the correct

    print $globref &quot;output\n&quot;;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">It&rsquo;s
important to understand that we are specifically <i>not</i>
dereferencing <tt>$arrayref[0]</tt> or
<tt>$hashref{&quot;KEY&quot;}</tt> there. The dereference of
the scalar variable happens <i>before</i> it does any key
lookups. Anything more complicated than a simple scalar
variable must use methods 2 or 3 below. However, a
&quot;simple scalar&quot; includes an identifier that itself
uses method 1 recursively. Therefore, the following prints
&quot;howdy&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Anywhere you&rsquo;d put an
identifier (or chain of identifiers) as part of a variable

<small>BLOCK</small> returning a reference of the correct
type. In other words, the previous examples could be written
like this:</p></td></tr>
</table>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    $bar = ${$scalarref};

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Admittedly,
it&rsquo;s a little silly to use the curlies in this case,
but the <small>BLOCK</small> can contain any arbitrary
expression, in particular, subscripted expressions:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    &amp;{ $dispatch{$index} }(1,2,3);      # call correct routine</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Because of
being able to omit the curlies for the simple case of
<tt>$$x</tt>, people often make the mistake of viewing the
dereferencing symbols as proper operators, and wonder about
their precedence. If they were, though, you could use
parentheses instead of braces. That&rsquo;s not the case.
Consider the difference below; case 0 is a short-hand
version of case 1, <i>not</i> case 2:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    $$hashref{&quot;KEY&quot;}   = &quot;VALUE&quot;;       # CASE 0
    ${$hashref}{&quot;KEY&quot;} = &quot;VALUE&quot;;       # CASE 1
    ${$hashref{&quot;KEY&quot;}} = &quot;VALUE&quot;;       # CASE 2
    ${$hashref&minus;&gt;{&quot;KEY&quot;}} = &quot;VALUE&quot;;     # CASE 3</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Case 2 is also
deceptive in that you&rsquo;re accessing a variable called
<tt>%hashref</tt>, not dereferencing through
<tt>$hashref</tt> to the hash it&rsquo;s presumably
referencing. That would be case 3.</p>

of the arrow can be any expression returning a reference,
including a previous dereference. Note that
<tt>$array[$x]</tt> is <i>not</i> the same thing as

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    $array[$x]&minus;&gt;{&quot;foo&quot;}&minus;&gt;[0] = &quot;January&quot;;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This is one of
the cases we mentioned earlier in which references could
spring into existence when in an lvalue context. Before this
statement, <tt>$array[$x]</tt> may have been undefined. If
so, it&rsquo;s automatically defined with a hash reference
so that we can look up
<tt>&quot;{&quot;foo&quot;}&quot;</tt> in it. Likewise
<tt>&quot;$array[$x]&minus;&gt;{&quot;foo&quot;}&quot;</tt>
will automatically get defined with an array reference so
that we can look up <tt>&quot;[0]&quot;</tt> in it. This
process is called <i>autovivification</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">One more thing
here. The arrow is optional <i>between</i> brackets
subscripts, so you can shrink the above down to</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    $array[$x]{&quot;foo&quot;}[0] = &quot;January&quot;;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Which, in the
degenerate case of using only ordinary arrays, gives you
multidimensional arrays just like C&rsquo;s:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    $score[$x][$y][$z] += 42;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Well, okay, not
entirely like C&rsquo;s arrays, actually. C doesn&rsquo;t

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If a reference happens to be a
reference to an object, then there are probably methods to
access the things referred to, and you should probably stick
to those methods unless you&rsquo;re in the class package
that defines the object&rsquo;s methods. In other words, be
nice, and don&rsquo;t violate the object&rsquo;s
encapsulation without a very good reason. Perl does not
enforce encapsulation. We are not totalitarians here. We do
expect some basic civility though.</p></td></tr>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Using a string
or number as a reference produces a symbolic reference, as
explained above. Using a reference as a number produces an
integer representing its storage location in memory. The
only useful thing to be done with this is to compare two
references numerically to see whether they refer to the same
location.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    if ($ref1 == $ref2) {  # cheap numeric compare of references
        print &quot;refs 1 and 2 refer to the same thing\n&quot;;
    }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Using a
reference as a string produces both its referent&rsquo;s
type, including any package blessing as described in
perlobj, as well as the numeric address expressed in hex.
The <i>ref()</i> operator returns just the type of thing the
reference is pointing to, without the address. See
&quot;ref&quot; in perlfunc for details and examples of its
use.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>bless()</i> operator may be used to associate the object
a reference points to with a package functioning as an
object class. See perlobj.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A typeglob may
be dereferenced the same way a reference can, because the
dereference syntax always indicates the type of reference
desired. So <tt>&quot;${*foo}&quot;</tt> and
<tt>&quot;${\$foo}&quot;</tt> both indicate the same scalar
variable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Here&rsquo;s a
trick for interpolating a subroutine call into a string:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    print &quot;My sub returned @{[mysub(1,2,3)]} that time.\n&quot;;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The way it
works is that when the <tt>&quot;@{...}&quot;</tt> is seen
in the double-quoted string, it&rsquo;s evaluated as a
block. The block creates a reference to an anonymous array
containing the results of the call to
<tt>&quot;mysub(1,2,3)&quot;</tt>. So the whole block
returns a reference to an array, which is then dereferenced
by <tt>&quot;@{...}&quot;</tt> and stuck into the
double-quoted string. This chicanery is also useful for
arbitrary expressions:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    print &quot;That yields @{[$n + 5]} widgets\n&quot;;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Similarly, an
expression that returns a reference to a scalar can be
dereferenced via <tt>&quot;${...}&quot;</tt>. Thus, the
above expression may be written as:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    print &quot;That yields ${\($n + 5)} widgets\n&quot;;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Circular
References</b> <br>
It is possible to create a &quot;circular reference&quot; in
Perl, which can lead to memory leaks. A circular reference
occurs when two references contain a reference to each
other, like this:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    my $foo = {};
    my $bar = { foo =&gt; $foo };
    $foo&minus;&gt;{bar} = $bar;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can also
create a circular reference with a single variable:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    my $foo;
    $foo = \$foo;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In this case,
the reference count for the variables will never reach 0,
and the references will never be garbage-collected. This can
lead to memory leaks.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Because objects
in Perl are implemented as references, it&rsquo;s possible
to have circular references with objects as well. Imagine a
TreeNode class where each node references its parent and
child nodes. Any node with a parent will be part of a
circular reference.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can break
circular references by creating a &quot;weak
reference&quot;. A weak reference does not increment the
reference count for a variable, which means that the object
can go out of scope and be destroyed. You can weaken a
reference with the <tt>&quot;weaken&quot;</tt> function
exported by the Scalar::Util module.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Here&rsquo;s
how we can make the first example safer:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    use Scalar::Util 'weaken';
    my $foo = {};
    my $bar = { foo =&gt; $foo };
    $foo&minus;&gt;{bar} = $bar;
    weaken $foo&minus;&gt;{bar};</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The reference
from <tt>$foo</tt> to <tt>$bar</tt> has been weakened. When
the <tt>$bar</tt> variable goes out of scope, it will be
garbage-collected. The next time you look at the value of
the <tt>&quot;$foo&minus;&gt;{bar}&quot;</tt> key, it will
be <tt>&quot;undef&quot;</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This action at
a distance can be confusing, so you should be careful with
your use of weaken. You should weaken the reference in the
variable that will go out of scope <i>first</i>. That way,
the longer-lived variable will contain the expected
reference until it goes out of scope.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Symbolic
references</b> <br>
We said that references spring into existence as necessary
if they are undefined, but we didn&rsquo;t say what happens
if a value used as a reference is already defined, but
<i>isn&rsquo;t</i> a hard reference. If you use it as a
reference, it&rsquo;ll be treated as a symbolic reference.
That is, the value of the scalar is taken to be the
<i>name</i> of a variable, rather than a direct link to a
(possibly) anonymous value.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">People
frequently expect it to work like this. So it does.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    $name = &quot;foo&quot;;
    $$name = 1;                 # Sets $foo
    ${$name} = 2;               # Sets $foo
    ${$name x 2} = 3;           # Sets $foofoo
    $name&minus;&gt;[0] = 4;             # Sets $foo[0]
    @$name = ();                # Clears @foo
    &amp;$name();                   # Calls &amp;foo() (as in Perl 4)
    $pack = &quot;THAT&quot;;
    ${&quot;${pack}::$name&quot;} = 5;    # Sets $THAT::foo without eval</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This is
powerful, and slightly dangerous, in that it&rsquo;s
possible to intend (with the utmost sincerity) to use a hard
reference, and accidentally use a symbolic reference
instead. To protect against that, you can say</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    use strict 'refs';</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">and then only
hard references will be allowed for the rest of the
enclosing block. An inner block may countermand that
with</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    no strict 'refs';</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Only package
variables (globals, even if localized) are visible to
symbolic references. Lexical variables (declared with
<i>my()</i>) aren&rsquo;t in a symbol table, and thus are
invisible to this mechanism. For example:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    local $value = 10;
    $ref = &quot;value&quot;;
    {
        my $value = 20;
        print $$ref;
    }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This will still
print 10, not 20. Remember that <i>local()</i> affects
package variables, which are all &quot;global&quot; to the
package.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Not-so-symbolic
references</b> <br>
Since Perl verion 5.001, brackets around a symbolic
reference can simply serve to isolate an identifier or
variable name from the rest of an expression, just as they
always have within a string. For example,</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    $push = &quot;pop on &quot;;
    print &quot;${push}over&quot;;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">has always
meant to print &quot;pop on over&quot;, even though push is
a reserved word. In 5.001, this was generalized to work the
same without the enclosing double quotes, so that</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    print ${push} . &quot;over&quot;;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">and even</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    print ${ push } . &quot;over&quot;;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">will have the
same effect. (This would have been a syntax error in Perl
5.000, though Perl 4 allowed it in the spaceless form.) This
construct is <i>not</i> considered to be a symbolic
reference when you&rsquo;re using strict refs:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    use strict 'refs';
    ${ bareword };      # Okay, means $bareword.
    ${ &quot;bareword&quot; };    # Error, symbolic reference.</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Similarly,
because of all the subscripting that is done using single
words, the same rule applies to any bareword that is used
for subscripting a hash. So now, instead of writing</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    $array{ &quot;aaa&quot; }{ &quot;bbb&quot; }{ &quot;ccc&quot; }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">you can write
just</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    $array{ aaa }{ bbb }{ ccc }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">and not worry
about whether the subscripts are reserved words. In the rare
event that you do wish to do something like</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    $array{ shift }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">you can force
interpretation as a reserved word by adding anything that
makes it more than a bareword:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    $array{ shift() }
    $array{ +shift }
    $array{ shift @_ }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<tt>&quot;use warnings&quot;</tt> pragma or the
<b>&minus;w</b> switch will warn you if it interprets a
reserved word as a string. But it will no longer warn you
about using lowercase words, because the string is
effectively quoted.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Pseudo-hashes:
Using an array as a hash</b> <br>
Pseudo-hashes have been removed from Perl. The
&rsquo;fields&rsquo; pragma remains available.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Function
Templates</b> <br>
As explained above, an anonymous function with access to the
lexical variables visible when that function was compiled,
creates a closure. It retains access to those variables even
though it doesn&rsquo;t get run until later, such as in a
signal handler or a Tk callback.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Using a closure
as a function template allows us to generate many functions
that act similarly. Suppose you wanted functions named after
the colors that generated <small>HTML</small> font changes
for the various colors:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    print &quot;Be &quot;, red(&quot;careful&quot;), &quot;with that &quot;, green(&quot;light&quot;);</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>red()</i> and <i>green()</i> functions would be similar.
To create these, we&rsquo;ll assign a closure to a typeglob
of the name of the function we&rsquo;re trying to build.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    @colors = qw(red blue green yellow orange purple violet);
    for my $name (@colors) {
        no strict 'refs';       # allow symbol table manipulation
        *$name = *{uc $name} = sub { &quot;&lt;FONT COLOR='$name'&gt;@_&lt;/FONT&gt;&quot; };
    }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Now all those
different functions appear to exist independently. You can
call <i>red()</i>, <i><small>RED</small> ()</i>,
<i>blue()</i>, <i><small>BLUE</small> ()</i>,
<i>green()</i>, etc. This technique saves on both compile
time and memory use, and is less error-prone as well, since
syntax checks happen at compile time. It&rsquo;s critical
that any variables in the anonymous subroutine be lexicals
in order to create a proper closure. That&rsquo;s the
reasons for the <tt>&quot;my&quot;</tt> on the loop
iteration variable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This is one of
the only places where giving a prototype to a closure makes
much sense. If you wanted to impose scalar context on the
arguments of these functions (probably not a wise idea for
this particular example), you could have written it this way
instead:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    *$name = sub ($) { &quot;&lt;FONT COLOR='$name'&gt;$_[0]&lt;/FONT&gt;&quot; };</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">However, since
prototype checking happens at compile time, the assignment
above happens too late to be of much use. You could address
this by putting the whole loop of assignments within a
<small>BEGIN</small> block, forcing it to occur during
compilation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Access to
lexicals that change over time--like those in the
<tt>&quot;for&quot;</tt> loop above, basically aliases to
elements from the surrounding lexical scopes-- only works
with anonymous subs, not with named subroutines. Generally
said, named subroutines do not nest properly and should only
be declared in the main package scope.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This is because
named subroutines are created at compile time so their
lexical variables get assigned to the parent lexicals from
the first execution of the parent block. If a parent scope
is entered a second time, its lexicals are created again,
while the nested subs still reference the old ones.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Anonymous
subroutines get to capture each time you execute the
<tt>&quot;sub&quot;</tt> operator, as they are created on
the fly. If you are accustomed to using nested subroutines
in other programming languages with their own private
variables, you&rsquo;ll have to work at it a bit in Perl.
The intuitive coding of this type of thing incurs mysterious
warnings about &quot;will not stay shared&quot; due to the
reasons explained above. For example, this won&rsquo;t
work:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    sub outer {
        my $x = $_[0] + 35;
        sub inner { return $x * 19 }   # WRONG
        return $x + inner();
    }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A work-around
is the following:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    sub outer {
        my $x = $_[0] + 35;
        local *inner = sub { return $x * 19 };
        return $x + inner();
    }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Now
<i>inner()</i> can only be called from within
<i>outer()</i>, because of the temporary assignments of the
anonymous subroutine. But when it does, it has normal access
to the lexical variable <tt>$x</tt> from the scope of
<i>outer()</i> at the time outer is invoked.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This has the
interesting effect of creating a function local to another
function, something not normally supported in Perl.</p>

<h2>WARNING
<a name="WARNING"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You may not
(usefully) use a reference as the key to a hash. It will be
converted into a string:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    $x{ \$a } = $a;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you try to

    $x{ $r } = $r;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">And then at
least you can use the <i>values()</i>, which will be real
refs, instead of the <i>keys()</i>, which won&rsquo;t.</p>
