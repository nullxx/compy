POSIX.2 regular expressions</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Regular
expressions (&quot;RE&quot;s), as defined in POSIX.2, come
in two forms: modern REs (roughly those of <i>egrep</i>;
POSIX.2 calls these &quot;extended&quot; REs) and obsolete
REs (roughly those of <b>ed</b>(1); POSIX.2
&quot;basic&quot; REs). Obsolete REs mostly exist for
backward compatibility in some old programs; they will be
discussed at the end. POSIX.2 leaves some aspects of RE
syntax and semantics open; &quot;(!)&quot; marks decisions
on these aspects that may not be fully portable to other
POSIX.2 implementations.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A (modern) RE
is one(!) or more nonempty(!) <i>branches</i>, separated by
'|'. It matches anything that matches one of the
branches.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A branch is
one(!) or more <i>pieces</i>, concatenated. It matches a
match for the first, followed by a match for the second,
etc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A piece is an
<i>atom</i> possibly followed by a single(!) '*', '+', '?',
or <i>bound</i>. An atom followed by '*' matches a sequence
of 0 or more matches of the atom. An atom followed by '+'
matches a sequence of 1 or more matches of the atom. An atom
followed by '?' matches a sequence of 0 or 1 matches of the
atom.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A <i>bound</i>
is '{' followed by an unsigned decimal integer, possibly
followed by ',' possibly followed by another unsigned
decimal integer, always followed by '}'. The integers must
lie between 0 and <b>RE_DUP_MAX</b> (255(!)) inclusive, and
if there are two of them, the first may not exceed the
second. An atom followed by a bound containing one integer
<i>i</i> and no comma matches a sequence of exactly <i>i</i>
matches of the atom. An atom followed by a bound containing
one integer <i>i</i> and a comma matches a sequence of
<i>i</i> or more matches of the atom. An atom followed by a
bound containing two integers <i>i</i> and <i>j</i> matches
a sequence of <i>i</i> through <i>j</i> (inclusive) matches
of the atom.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">An atom is a
regular expression enclosed in &quot;<i>()</i>&quot;
(matching a match for the regular expression), an empty set
of &quot;<i>()</i>&quot; (matching the null string)(!), a
<i>bracket expression</i> (see below), '.' (matching any
single character), '^' (matching the null string at the
beginning of a line), '$' (matching the null string at the
end of a line), a '\' followed by one of the characters
&quot;<i>^.[$()|*+?{\</i>&quot; (matching that character
taken as an ordinary character), a '\' followed by any other
character(!) (matching that character taken as an ordinary
character, as if the '\' had not been present(!)), or a
single character with no other significance (matching that
character). A '{' followed by a character other than a digit
is an ordinary character, not the beginning of a bound(!).
It is illegal to end an RE with '\'.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A <i>bracket
expression</i> is a list of characters enclosed in
&quot;<i>[]</i>&quot;. It normally matches any single
character from the list (but see below). If the list begins
with '^', it matches any single character (but see below)
<i>not</i> from the rest of the list. If two characters in
the list are separated by '&minus;', this is shorthand for
the full <i>range</i> of characters between those two
(inclusive) in the collating sequence, for example,
&quot;<i>[0&minus;9]</i>&quot; in ASCII matches any decimal
digit. It is illegal(!) for two ranges to share an endpoint,
for example, &quot;<i>a-c-e</i>&quot;. Ranges are very
collating-sequence-dependent, and portable programs should
avoid relying on them.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To include a
literal ']' in the list, make it the first character
(following a possible '^'). To include a literal '&minus;',
make it the first or last character, or the second endpoint
of a range. To use a literal '&minus;' as the first endpoint
of a range, enclose it in &quot;<i>[.</i>&quot; and
&quot;<i>.]</i>&quot; to make it a collating element (see
below). With the exception of these and some combinations
using '[' (see next paragraphs), all other special
characters, including '\', lose their special significance
within a bracket expression.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Within a
bracket expression, a collating element (a character, a
multicharacter sequence that collates as if it were a single
character, or a collating-sequence name for either) enclosed
in &quot;<i>[.</i>&quot; and &quot;<i>.]</i>&quot; stands
for the sequence of characters of that collating element.
The sequence is a single element of the bracket
expression&rsquo;s list. A bracket expression containing a
multicharacter collating element can thus match more than
one character, for example, if the collating sequence
includes a &quot;ch&quot; collating element, then the RE
&quot;<i>[[.ch.]]*c</i>&quot; matches the first five
characters of &quot;chchcc&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Within a
bracket expression, a collating element enclosed in
&quot;<i>[=</i>&quot; and &quot;<i>=]</i>&quot; is an
equivalence class, standing for the sequences of characters
of all collating elements equivalent to that one, including
itself. (If there are no other equivalent collating
elements, the treatment is as if the enclosing delimiters
were &quot;<i>[.</i>&quot; and &quot;<i>.]</i>&quot;.) For
example, if o and ^ are the members of an equivalence class,
then &quot;<i>[[=o=]]</i>&quot;,
&quot;<i>[[=</i><b><i>^=]]</i></b>&quot;, and
&quot;<i>[o</i><b><i>^]</i></b>&quot; are all synonymous. An
equivalence class may not(!) be an endpoint of a range.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Within a
bracket expression, the name of a <i>character class</i>
enclosed in &quot;<i>[:</i>&quot; and &quot;<i>:]</i>&quot;
stands for the list of all characters belonging to that
class. Standard character class names are:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These stand for
the character classes defined in <b>wctype</b>(3). A locale
may provide others. A character class may not be used as an
endpoint of a range.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In the event
that an RE could match more than one substring of a given
string, the RE matches the one starting earliest in the
string. If the RE could match more than one substring
starting at that point, it matches the longest.
Subexpressions also match the longest possible substrings,
subject to the constraint that the whole match be as long as
possible, with subexpressions starting earlier in the RE
taking priority over ones starting later. Note that
higher-level subexpressions thus take priority over their
lower-level component subexpressions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Match lengths
are measured in characters, not collating elements. A null
string is considered longer than no match at all. For
example, &quot;<i>bb*</i>&quot; matches the three middle
characters of &quot;abbbc&quot;,
&quot;<i>(wee|week)(knights|nights)</i>&quot; matches all
ten characters of &quot;weeknights&quot;, when
&quot;<i>(.*).*</i>&quot; is matched against &quot;abc&quot;
the parenthesized subexpression matches all three
characters, and when &quot;<i>(a*)*</i>&quot; is matched
against &quot;bc&quot; both the whole RE and the
parenthesized subexpression match the null string.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If
case-independent matching is specified, the effect is much
as if all case distinctions had vanished from the alphabet.
When an alphabetic that exists in multiple cases appears as
an ordinary character outside a bracket expression, it is
effectively transformed into a bracket expression containing
both cases, for example, 'x' becomes
&quot;<i>[xX]</i>&quot;. When it appears inside a bracket
expression, all case counterparts of it are added to the
bracket expression, so that, for example,
&quot;<i>[x]</i>&quot; becomes &quot;<i>[xX]</i>&quot; and
&quot;<i>[^x]</i>&quot; becomes
&quot;<i>[^xX]</i>&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">No particular
limit is imposed on the length of REs(!). Programs intended
to be portable should not employ REs longer than 256 bytes,
as an implementation can refuse to accept such REs and
remain POSIX-compliant.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Obsolete
(&quot;basic&quot;) regular expressions differ in several
respects. '|', '+', and '?' are ordinary characters and
there is no equivalent for their functionality. The
delimiters for bounds are &quot;<i>\{</i>&quot; and
&quot;<i>\}</i>&quot;, with '{' and '}' by themselves
ordinary characters. The parentheses for nested
subexpressions are &quot;<i>\(</i>&quot; and
&quot;<i>\)</i>&quot;, with '(' and ')' by themselves
ordinary characters. '^' is an ordinary character except at
the beginning of the RE or(!) the beginning of a
parenthesized subexpression, '$' is an ordinary character
except at the end of the RE or(!) the end of a parenthesized
subexpression, and '*' is an ordinary character if it
appears at the beginning of the RE or the beginning of a
parenthesized subexpression (after a possible leading
'^').</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Finally, there
is one new type of atom, a <i>back reference</i>: '\'
followed by a nonzero decimal digit <i>d</i> matches the
same sequence of characters matched by the <i>d</i>th
parenthesized subexpression (numbering subexpressions by the
positions of their opening parentheses, left to right), so
that, for example, &quot;<i>\([bc]\)\1</i>&quot; matches
&quot;bb&quot; or &quot;cc&quot; but not &quot;bc&quot;.</p>

<h2>BUGS
<a name="BUGS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Having two
kinds of REs is a botch.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The current
POSIX.2 spec says that ')' is an ordinary character in the
absence of an unmatched '('; this was an unintentional
result of a wording error, and change is likely. Avoid
relying on it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Back references
are a dreadful botch, posing major problems for efficient
implementations. They are also somewhat vaguely defined
(does &quot;<i>a\(\(b\)*\2\)*d</i>&quot; match
&quot;abbbd&quot;?). Avoid using them.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">POSIX.2&rsquo;s
specification of case-independent matching is vague. The
&quot;one case implies all cases&quot; definition given
above is current consensus among implementors as to the
right interpretation.</p>
