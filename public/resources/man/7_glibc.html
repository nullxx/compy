<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">libc &minus;
overview of standard C libraries on Linux</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The term
&quot;libc&quot; is commonly used as a shorthand for the
&quot;standard C library&quot;, a library of standard
functions that can be used by all C programs (and sometimes
by programs in other languages). Because of some history
(see below), use of the term &quot;libc&quot; to refer to
the standard C library is somewhat ambiguous on Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>glibc</b>
<br>
By far the most widely used C library on Linux is the GNU C
Library
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/">http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/</a>,
often referred to as <i>glibc</i>. This is the C library
that is nowadays used in all major Linux distributions. It
is also the C library whose details are documented in the
relevant pages of the <i>man-pages</i> project (primarily in
Section 3 of the manual). Documentation of glibc is also
available in the glibc manual, available via the command
<i>info libc</i>. Release 1.0 of glibc was made in September
1992. (There were earlier 0.x releases.) The next major
release of glibc was 2.0, at the beginning of 1997.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The pathname
<i>/lib/libc.so.6</i> (or something similar) is normally a
symbolic link that points to the location of the glibc
library, and executing this pathname will cause glibc to
display various information about the version installed on
your system.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Linux
libc</b> <br>
In the early to mid 1990s, there was for a while <i>Linux
libc</i>, a fork of glibc 1.x created by Linux developers
who felt that glibc development at the time was not
sufficing for the needs of Linux. Often, this library was
referred to (ambiguously) as just &quot;libc&quot;. Linux
libc released major versions 2, 3, 4, and 5 (as well as many
minor versions of those releases). For a while, Linux libc
was the standard C library in many Linux distributions.
However, notwithstanding the original motivations of the
Linux libc effort, by the time glibc 2.0 was released, it
was clearly superior to Linux libc, and all major Linux
distributions that had been using Linux libc soon switched
back to glibc. (Since this switch occurred over a decade
ago, <i>man-pages</i> no longer takes care to document Linux
libc details. Nevertheless, the history is visible in
vestiges of information about Linux libc that remain in some
manual pages, in particular, references to <i>libc4</i> and
<i>libc5</i>.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Other C
libraries</b> <br>
There are various other less widely used C libraries for
Linux. These libraries are generally smaller than glibc,
both in terms of features and memory footprint, and often
intended for building small binaries, perhaps targeted at
development for embedded Linux systems. Among such libraries
are <i>uClibc</i> (<i>http://www.uclibc.org/</i>) and
<i>dietlibc</i> (<i>http://www.fefe.de/dietlibc/</i>).
Details of these libraries are generally not covered by the
<i>man-pages</i> project.</p>
