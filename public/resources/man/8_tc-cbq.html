<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Class Based
Queueing is a classful qdisc that implements a rich
linksharing hierarchy of classes. It contains shaping
elements as well as prioritizing capabilities. Shaping is
performed using link idle time calculations based on the
timing of dequeue events and underlying link bandwidth.</p>

<h2>SHAPING ALGORITHM
<a name="SHAPING ALGORITHM"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When shaping a
10mbit/s connection to 1mbit/s, the link will be idle 90% of
the time. If it isn&rsquo;t, it needs to be throttled so
that it IS idle 90% of the time.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">During
operations, the effective idletime is measured using an
exponential weighted moving average (EWMA), which considers
recent packets to be exponentially more important than past
ones. The Unix loadaverage is calculated in the same
way.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The calculated
idle time is subtracted from the EWMA measured one, the
resulting number is called &rsquo;avgidle&rsquo;. A
perfectly loaded link has an avgidle of zero: packets arrive
exactly at the calculated interval.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">An overloaded
link has a negative avgidle and if it gets too negative, CBQ
throttles and is then &rsquo;overlimit&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Conversely, an
idle link might amass a huge avgidle, which would then allow
infinite bandwidths after a few hours of silence. To prevent
this, avgidle is capped at <b>maxidle.</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If overlimit,
in theory, the CBQ could throttle itself for exactly the
amount of time that was calculated to pass between packets,
and then pass one packet, and throttle again. Due to timer
resolution constraints, this may not be feasible, see the
<b>minburst</b> parameter below.</p>

<h2>CLASSIFICATION
<a name="CLASSIFICATION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Within the one
CBQ instance many classes may exist. Each of these classes
contains another qdisc, by default <b>tc-pfifo</b>(8).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When enqueueing
a packet, CBQ starts at the root and uses various methods to
determine which class should receive the data.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In the absence
of uncommon configuration options, the process is rather
easy. At each node we look for an instruction, and then go
to the class the instruction refers us to. If the class
found is a barren leaf-node (without children), we enqueue
the packet there. If it is not yet a leaf node, we do the
whole thing over again starting from that node.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
actions are performed, in order at each node we visit, until
one sends us to another node, or terminates the process.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="7%">


<p>(i)</p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>Consult filters attached to the class. If sent to a
leafnode, we are done. Otherwise, restart.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="7%">


<p>(ii)</p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>Consult the defmap for the priority assigned to this
packet, which depends on the TOS bits. Check if the referral
is leafless, otherwise restart.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="7%">


<p>(iii)</p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>Ask the defmap for instructions for the &rsquo;best
effort&rsquo; priority. Check the answer for leafness,
otherwise restart.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="7%">


<p>(iv)</p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>If none of the above returned with an instruction,
enqueue at this node.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This algorithm
makes sure that a packet always ends up somewhere, even
while you are busy building your configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For more
details, see <b>tc-cbq-details(8).</b></p>

<h2>LINK SHARING ALGORITHM
<a name="LINK SHARING ALGORITHM"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When dequeuing
for sending to the network device, CBQ decides which of its
classes will be allowed to send. It does so with a Weighted
Round Robin process in which each class with packets gets a
chance to send in turn. The WRR process starts by asking the
highest priority classes (lowest numerically - highest
semantically) for packets, and will continue to do so until
they have no more data to offer, in which case the process
repeats for lower priorities.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Classes by
default borrow bandwidth from their siblings. A class can be
prevented from doing so by declaring it
&rsquo;bounded&rsquo;. A class can also indicate its
unwillingness to lend out bandwidth by being
&rsquo;isolated&rsquo;.</p>

<h2>QDISC
<a name="QDISC"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The root of a
CBQ qdisc class tree has the following parameters: <br>
parent major:minor | root</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This mandatory parameter
determines the place of the CBQ instance, either at the
<b>root</b> of an interface or within an existing class.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">handle major:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Like all other qdiscs, the CBQ
can be assigned a handle. Should consist only of a major
number, followed by a colon. Optional, but very useful if
classes will be generated within this qdisc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">allot bytes</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This allotment is the
&rsquo;chunkiness&rsquo; of link sharing and is used for
determining packet transmission time tables. The qdisc allot
differs slightly from the class allot discussed below.
Optional. Defaults to a reasonable value, related to
avpkt.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">avpkt bytes</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The average size of a packet is
needed for calculating maxidle, and is also used for making
sure &rsquo;allot&rsquo; has a safe value. Mandatory.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">bandwidth rate</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">To determine the idle time, CBQ
must know the bandwidth of your underlying physical
interface, or parent qdisc. This is a vital parameter, more
about it later. Mandatory.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="6%">


<p>cell</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>The cell size determines he granularity of packet
transmission time calculations. Has a sensible default.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="6%">


<p>mpu</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>A zero sized packet may still take time to transmit.
This value is the lower cap for packet transmission time
calculations - packets smaller than this value are still
deemed to have this size. Defaults to zero.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">ewma log</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">When CBQ needs to measure the
average idle time, it does so using an Exponentially
Weighted Moving Average which smooths out measurements into
a moving average. The EWMA LOG determines how much smoothing
occurs. Lower values imply greater sensitivity. Must be
between 0 and 31. Defaults to 5.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A CBQ qdisc
does not shape out of its own accord. It only needs to know
certain parameters about the underlying link. Actual shaping
is done in classes.</p>

<h2>CLASSES
<a name="CLASSES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Classes have a
host of parameters to configure their operation. <br>
parent major:minor</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Place of this class within the
hierarchy. If attached directly to a qdisc and not to
another class, minor can be omitted. Mandatory.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">classid major:minor</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Like qdiscs, classes can be
named. The major number must be equal to the major number of
the qdisc to which it belongs. Optional, but needed if this
class is going to have children.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">weight weight</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">When dequeuing to the
interface, classes are tried for traffic in a round-robin
fashion. Classes with a higher configured qdisc will
generally have more traffic to offer during each round, so
it makes sense to allow it to dequeue more traffic. All
weights under a class are normalized, so only the ratios
matter. Defaults to the configured rate, unless the priority
of this class is maximal, in which case it is set to 1.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">allot bytes</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Allot specifies how many bytes
a qdisc can dequeue during each round of the process. This
parameter is weighted using the renormalized class weight
described above. Silently capped at a minimum of 3/2 avpkt.
Mandatory.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">prio priority</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">In the round-robin process,
classes with the lowest priority field are tried for packets
first. Mandatory.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="7%">


<p>avpkt</p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="33%">


<p>See the QDISC section.</p></td>
<td width="45%">
</td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">rate rate</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Maximum rate this class and all
its children combined can send at. Mandatory.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">bandwidth rate</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This is different from the
bandwidth specified when creating a CBQ disc! Only used to
determine maxidle and offtime, which are only calculated
when specifying maxburst or minburst. Mandatory if
specifying maxburst or minburst.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">maxburst</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This number of packets is used
to calculate maxidle so that when avgidle is at maxidle,
this number of average packets can be burst before avgidle
drops to 0. Set it higher to be more tolerant of bursts. You
can&rsquo;t set maxidle directly, only via this
parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">minburst</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">As mentioned before, CBQ needs
to throttle in case of overlimit. The ideal solution is to
do so for exactly the calculated idle time, and pass 1
packet. However, Unix kernels generally have a hard time
scheduling events shorter than 10ms, so it is better to
throttle for a longer period, and then pass minburst packets
in one go, and then sleep minburst times longer.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The time to
wait is called the offtime. Higher values of minburst lead
to more accurate shaping in the long term, but to bigger
bursts at millisecond timescales. Optional.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">minidle</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If avgidle is below 0, we are
overlimits and need to wait until avgidle will be big enough
to send one packet. To prevent a sudden burst from shutting
down the link for a prolonged period of time, avgidle is
reset to minidle if it gets too low.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Minidle is
specified in negative microseconds, so 10 means that avgidle
is capped at -10us. Optional.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">bounded</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Signifies that this class will
not borrow bandwidth from its siblings.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">isolated</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Means that this class will not
borrow bandwidth to its siblings</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">split major:minor &amp; defmap
bitmap[/bitmap]</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If consulting filters attached
to a class did not give a verdict, CBQ can also classify
based on the packet&rsquo;s priority. There are 16
priorities available, numbered from 0 to 15.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The defmap
specifies which priorities this class wants to receive,
specified as a bitmap. The Least Significant Bit corresponds
to priority zero. The <b>split</b> parameter tells CBQ at
which class the decision must be made, which should be a
(grand)parent of the class you are adding.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">As an example,
&rsquo;tc class add ... classid 10:1 cbq .. split 10:0
defmap c0&rsquo; configures class 10:0 to send packets with
priorities 6 and 7 to 10:1.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The
complimentary configuration would then be: &rsquo;tc class
add ... classid 10:2 cbq ... split 10:0 defmap 3f&rsquo;
Which would send all packets 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 to
10:1.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">estimator interval
timeconstant</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">CBQ can measure how much
bandwidth each class is using, which tc filters can use to
classify packets with. In order to determine the bandwidth
it uses a very simple estimator that measures once every
<b>interval</b> microseconds how much traffic has passed.
This again is a EWMA, for which the time constant can be
specified, also in microseconds. The <b>time constant</b>
corresponds to the sluggishness of the measurement or,
conversely, to the sensitivity of the average to short
bursts. Higher values mean less sensitivity.</p>

<h2>BUGS
<a name="BUGS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The actual
bandwidth of the underlying link may not be known, for
example in the case of PPoE or PPTP connections which in
fact may send over a pipe, instead of over a physical
device. CBQ is quite resilient to major errors in the
configured bandwidth, probably a the cost of coarser
shaping.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Default kernels
rely on coarse timing information for making decisions.
These may make shaping precise in the long term, but
inaccurate on second long scales.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">See
<b>tc-cbq-details(8)</b> for hints on how to improve
this.</p>
