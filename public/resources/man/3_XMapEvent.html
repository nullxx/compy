<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">XMapEvent,
XMappingEvent &minus; MapNotify and MappingNotify event
structures</p>

<h2>STRUCTURES
<a name="STRUCTURES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The structure
for <i>MapNotify</i> events contains:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">typedef struct {
        int type;       /* MapNotify */
        unsigned long serial;   /* # of last request processed by server */
        Bool send_event;        /* true if this came from a SendEvent request */
        Display *display;       /* Display the event was read from */
        Window event;
        Window window;
        Bool override_redirect; /* boolean, is override set... */
} XMapEvent;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When you
receive this event, the structure members are set as
follows.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The type member
is set to the event type constant name that uniquely
identifies it. For example, when the X server reports a
<i>GraphicsExpose</i> event to a client application, it
sends an <i>XGraphicsExposeEvent</i> structure with the type
member set to <i>GraphicsExpose</i>. The display member is
set to a pointer to the display the event was read on. The
send_event member is set to <i>True</i> if the event came
from a <i>SendEvent</i> protocol request. The serial member
is set from the serial number reported in the protocol but
expanded from the 16-bit least-significant bits to a full
32-bit value. The window member is set to the window that is
most useful to toolkit dispatchers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The event
member is set either to the window that was mapped or to its
parent, depending on whether <i>StructureNotify</i> or
<i>SubstructureNotify</i> was selected. The window member is
set to the window that was mapped. The override_redirect
member is set to the override-redirect attribute of the
window. Window manager clients normally should ignore this
window if the override-redirect attribute is <i>True</i>,
because these events usually are generated from pop-ups,
which override structure control.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The structure
for <i>MappingNotify</i> events is:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">typedef struct {
        int type;       /* MappingNotify */
        unsigned long serial;   /* # of last request processed by server */
        Bool send_event;        /* true if this came from a SendEvent request */
        Display *display;       /* Display the event was read from */
        Window window;  /* unused */
        int request;    /* one of MappingModifier, MappingKeyboard,
                   MappingPointer */
        int first_keycode;      /* first keycode */
        int count;      /* defines range of change w. first_keycode*/
} XMappingEvent;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When you
receive this event, the structure members are set as
follows.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The type member

32-bit value. The window member is set to the window that is
most useful to toolkit dispatchers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The request
member is set to indicate the kind of mapping change that
occurred and can be <i>MappingModifier</i>,
<i>MappingKeyboard</i>, <i>MappingPointer</i>. If it is
<i>MappingModifier</i>, the modifier mapping was changed. If
it is <i>MappingKeyboard</i>, the keyboard mapping was
changed. If it is <i>MappingPointer</i>, the pointer button
mapping was changed. The first_keycode and count members are
set only if the request member was set to
<i>MappingKeyboard</i>. The number in first_keycode
represents the first number in the range of the altered
mapping, and count represents the number of keycodes
altered.</p>
