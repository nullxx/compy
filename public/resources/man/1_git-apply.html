<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Reads the
supplied diff output (i.e. &quot;a patch&quot;) and applies
it to files. With the &minus;&minus;index option the patch
is also applied to the index, and with the
&minus;&minus;cached option the patch is only applied to the
index. Without these options, the command applies the patch
only to files, and does not require them to be in a Git
repository.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This command
applies the patch but does not create a commit. Use
<b>git-am</b>(1) to create commits from patches generated by
<b>git-format-patch</b>(1) and/or received by email.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&lt;patch&gt;...</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The files to read the patch
from. <i>&minus;</i> can be used to read from the standard
input.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;stat</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Instead of applying the patch,
output diffstat for the input. Turns off
&quot;apply&quot;.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;numstat</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Similar to &minus;&minus;stat,
but shows the number of added and deleted lines in decimal
notation and the pathname without abbreviation, to make it
more machine friendly. For binary files, outputs two &minus;
instead of saying 0 0. Turns off &quot;apply&quot;.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;summary</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Instead of applying the patch,
output a condensed summary of information obtained from git
diff extended headers, such as creations, renames and mode
changes. Turns off &quot;apply&quot;.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;check</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Instead of applying the patch,
see if the patch is applicable to the current working tree
and/or the index file and detects errors. Turns off
&quot;apply&quot;.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;index</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When &minus;&minus;check is in
effect, or when applying the patch (which is the default
when none of the options that disables it is in effect),
make sure the patch is applicable to what the current index
file records. If the file to be patched in the working tree
is not up&minus;to&minus;date, it is flagged as an error.
This flag also causes the index file to be updated.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;cached</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Apply a patch without touching
the working tree. Instead take the cached data, apply the
patch, and store the result in the index without using the
working tree. This implies &minus;&minus;index.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;3,
&minus;&minus;3way</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When the patch does not apply
cleanly, fall back on 3&minus;way merge if the patch records
the identity of blobs it is supposed to apply to, and we
have those blobs available locally, possibly leaving the
conflict markers in the files in the working tree for the
user to resolve. This option implies the &minus;&minus;index
option, and is incompatible with the &minus;&minus;reject
and the &minus;&minus;cached options.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;build&minus;fake&minus;ancestor=&lt;file&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Newer <i>git diff</i> output
has embedded <i>index information</i> for each blob to help
identify the original version that the patch applies to.
When this flag is given, and if the original versions of the
blobs are available locally, builds a temporary index
containing those blobs.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">When a pure
mode change is encountered (which has no index information),
the information is read from the current index instead.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;R,
&minus;&minus;reverse</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Apply the patch in reverse.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;reject</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">For atomicity, <i>git apply</i>
by default fails the whole patch and does not touch the
working tree when some of the hunks do not apply. This
option makes it apply the parts of the patch that are
applicable, and leave the rejected hunks in corresponding
*.rej files.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;z</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When &minus;&minus;numstat has
been given, do not munge pathnames, but use a
NUL&minus;terminated machine&minus;readable format.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Without this
option, each pathname output will have TAB, LF, double
quotes, and backslash characters replaced with \t, \n,
\&quot;, and \\, respectively, and the pathname will be
enclosed in double quotes if any of those replacements
occurred.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;p&lt;n&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Remove &lt;n&gt; leading
slashes from traditional diff paths. The default is 1.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;C&lt;n&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Ensure at least &lt;n&gt; lines
of surrounding context match before and after each change.
When fewer lines of surrounding context exist they all must
match. By default no context is ever ignored.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;unidiff&minus;zero</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">By default, <i>git apply</i>
expects that the patch being applied is a unified diff with
at least one line of context. This provides good safety
measures, but breaks down when applying a diff generated
with &minus;&minus;unified=0. To bypass these checks use
&minus;&minus;unidiff&minus;zero.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note, for the
reasons stated above usage of context&minus;free patches is
discouraged.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;apply</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">If you use any of the options
marked &quot;Turns off <i>apply</i>&quot; above, <i>git
apply</i> reads and outputs the requested information
without actually applying the patch. Give this flag after
those flags to also apply the patch.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;no&minus;add</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When applying a patch, ignore
additions made by the patch. This can be used to extract the
common part between two files by first running <i>diff</i>
on them and applying the result with this option, which
would apply the deletion part but not the addition part.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;allow&minus;binary&minus;replacement,
&minus;&minus;binary</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Historically we did not allow
binary patch applied without an explicit permission from the
user, and this flag was the way to do so. Currently we
always allow binary patch application, so this is a
no&minus;op.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;exclude=&lt;path&minus;pattern&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Don&rsquo;t apply changes to
files matching the given path pattern. This can be useful
when importing patchsets, where you want to exclude certain
files or directories.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;include=&lt;path&minus;pattern&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Apply changes to files matching
the given path pattern. This can be useful when importing
patchsets, where you want to include certain files or
directories.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">When
&minus;&minus;exclude and &minus;&minus;include patterns are
used, they are examined in the order they appear on the
command line, and the first match determines if a patch to
each path is used. A patch to a path that does not match any
include/exclude pattern is used by default if there is no
include pattern on the command line, and ignored if there is
any include pattern.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;ignore&minus;space&minus;change,
&minus;&minus;ignore&minus;whitespace</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When applying a patch, ignore
changes in whitespace in context lines if necessary. Context
lines will preserve their whitespace, and they will not
undergo whitespace fixing regardless of the value of the
&minus;&minus;whitespace option. New lines will still be
fixed, though.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;whitespace=&lt;action&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When applying a patch, detect a
new or modified line that has whitespace errors. What are
considered whitespace errors is controlled by
core.whitespace configuration. By default, trailing
whitespaces (including lines that solely consist of
whitespaces) and a space character that is immediately
followed by a tab character inside the initial indent of the
line are considered whitespace errors.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">By default, the
command outputs warning messages but applies the patch. When
git&minus;apply is used for statistics and not applying a
patch, it defaults to nowarn.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">You can use
different &lt;action&gt; values to control this
behavior:</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; nowarn
turns off the trailing whitespace warning.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; warn
outputs warnings for a few such errors, but applies the
patch as&minus;is (default).</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; fix
outputs warnings for a few such errors, and applies the
patch after fixing them (strip is a synonym
&minus;&minus;&minus; the tool used to consider only
trailing whitespace characters as errors, and the fix
involved <i>stripping</i> them, but modern Gits do
more).</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; error
outputs warnings for a few such errors, and refuses to apply
the patch.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
error&minus;all is similar to error but shows all
errors.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;inaccurate&minus;eof</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Under certain circumstances,
some versions of <i>diff</i> do not correctly detect a
missing new&minus;line at the end of the file. As a result,
patches created by such <i>diff</i> programs do not record
incomplete lines correctly. This option adds support for
applying such patches by working around this bug.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;v,
&minus;&minus;verbose</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Report progress to stderr. By
default, only a message about the current patch being
applied will be printed. This option will cause additional
information to be reported.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;recount</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Do not trust the line counts in
the hunk headers, but infer them by inspecting the patch
(e.g. after editing the patch without adjusting the hunk
headers appropriately).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;directory=&lt;root&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Prepend &lt;root&gt; to all
filenames. If a &quot;&minus;p&quot; argument was also
passed, it is applied before prepending the new root.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">For example, a
patch that talks about updating a/git&minus;gui.sh to
b/git&minus;gui.sh can be applied to the file in the working
tree modules/git&minus;gui/git&minus;gui.sh by running git
apply &minus;&minus;directory=modules/git&minus;gui.</p>

<h2>CONFIGURATION
<a name="CONFIGURATION"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">apply.ignorewhitespace</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Set to <i>change</i> if you
want changes in whitespace to be ignored by default. Set to
one of: no, none, never, false if you want changes in
whitespace to be significant.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">apply.whitespace</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When no
&minus;&minus;whitespace flag is given from the command
line, this configuration item is used as the default.</p>

<h2>SUBMODULES
<a name="SUBMODULES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the patch
contains any changes to submodules then <i>git apply</i>
treats these changes as follows.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If
&minus;&minus;index is specified (explicitly or implicitly),
then the submodule commits must match the index exactly for
the patch to apply. If any of the submodules are
checked&minus;out, then these check&minus;outs are
completely ignored, i.e., they are not required to be
up&minus;to&minus;date or clean and they are not
updated.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If
&minus;&minus;index is not specified, then the submodule
commits in the patch are ignored and only the absence or
presence of the corresponding subdirectory is checked and
(if possible) updated.</p>
