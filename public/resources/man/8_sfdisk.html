<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">sfdisk &minus;
partition table manipulator for Linux</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>sfdisk</b>
[<i>options</i>] <i>device</i> <b><br>
sfdisk &minus;s</b> [<i>partition</i>]</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>sfdisk</b>
has four (main) uses: list the size of a partition, list the
partitions on a device, check the partitions on a device,
and &minus; very dangerous &minus; repartition a device.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>sfdisk</b>
doesn&rsquo;t understand the GUID Partition Table (GPT)
format and it is not designed for large partitions. In these
cases use the more advanced GNU <b>parted</b>(8).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
<b>sfdisk</b> does not align partitions to block device I/O
limits. This functionality is provided by
<b>fdisk</b>(8).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>List sizes
<br>
sfdisk &minus;s</b> <i>partition</i> gives the size of
<i>partition</i> in blocks. This may be useful in connection
with programs like <b>mkswap</b>(8). Here <i>partition</i>
is usually something like <i>/dev/hda1</i> or
<i>/dev/sdb12</i>, but may also be an entire disk, like
<i>/dev/xda</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">% sfdisk
&minus;s /dev/hda9 <br>
81599</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the
partition argument is omitted, <b>sfdisk</b> will list the
sizes of all block devices, and the total:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">% sfdisk
&minus;s <br>
/dev/hda: 208896 <br>
/dev/hdb: 1025136 <br>
/dev/hdc: 1031063 <br>
/dev/sda: 8877895 <br>
/dev/sdb: 1758927 <br>
total: 12901917 blocks</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>List
partitions</b> <br>
The second type of invocation: <b>sfdisk &minus;l</b>
<i>device</i> will list the partitions on the specified
device. If the <i>device</i> argument is omitted, the
partitions on all block devices are listed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">% sfdisk
&minus;l /dev/hdc</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Disk /dev/hdc:
16 heads, 63 sectors, 2045 cylinders <br>
Units = cylinders of 516096 bytes, blocks of 1024 bytes,
counting from 0</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Device Boot
Start End #cyls #blocks Id System <br>
/dev/hdc1 0+ 406 407&minus; 205096+ 83 Linux native <br>
/dev/hdc2 407 813 407 205128 83 Linux native <br>
/dev/hdc3 814 2044 1231 620424 83 Linux native <br>
/dev/hdc4 0 &minus; 0 0 0 Empty</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The trailing
&minus; and + signs indicate that rounding has taken place,
and that the actual value is slightly less or more. To see
the exact values, ask for a listing with sectors as unit
(<b>&minus;u S</b>).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Check
partitions</b> <br>
The third type of invocation: <b>sfdisk &minus;V</b>
<i>device</i> will apply various consistency checks to the
partition tables on <i>device</i>. It prints
&lsquo;OK&rsquo; or complains. The <b>&minus;V</b> option
can be used together with <b>&minus;l</b>. In a shell script
one might use <b>sfdisk &minus;V &minus;q</b> <i>device</i>
which only returns a status.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Create
partitions</b> <br>
The fourth type of invocation: <b>sfdisk</b> <i>device</i>
will cause <b>sfdisk</b> to read the specification for the
desired partitioning of <i>device</i> from standard input,
and then to change the partition tables on that block
device. Thus it is possible to use <b>sfdisk</b> from a
shell script. When <b>sfdisk</b> determines that its
standard input is a terminal, it will be conversational;
otherwise it will abort on any error.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">BE EXTREMELY
CAREFUL - ONE TYPING MISTAKE AND ALL YOUR DATA IS LOST</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As a
precaution, one can save the sectors changed by
<b>sfdisk</b>:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">% sfdisk
/dev/hdd &minus;O hdd-partition-sectors.save <br>
...</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Then, if you
discover that you did something stupid before anything else
has been written to the block device, it may be possible to
recover the old situation with:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">% sfdisk
/dev/hdd &minus;I hdd-partition-sectors.save</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">(This is not
the same as saving the old partition table: a readable
version of the old partition table can be saved using the
<b>&minus;d</b> option. However, if you create logical
partitions, the sectors describing them are located
somewhere on block device, possibly on sectors that were not
part of the partition table before. Thus, the information
the <b>&minus;O</b> option saves is not a binary version of
the output of <b>&minus;d</b>.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There are many
options.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;v</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;version</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Print version number of
<b>sfdisk</b> and exit immediately.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;h</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;help</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Print a usage message and exit
immediately.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;T</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;list&minus;types</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Print the recognized types
(system Id&rsquo;s).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;s</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;show&minus;size</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">List the size of a
partition.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;g</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;show&minus;geometry</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">List the kernel&rsquo;s idea of
the geometry of the indicated block device(s).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;G</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;show&minus;pt&minus;geometry</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">List the geometry of the
indicated block devices guessed by looking at the partition
table.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;l</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;list</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">List the partitions of a
device.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;d</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;dump</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Dump the partitions of a device
in a format that is usable as input to <b>sfdisk</b>. For
example, <br>
% sfdisk -d /dev/hda &gt; hda.out <br>
% sfdisk /dev/hda &lt; hda.out <br>
will correct the bad last extended partition that the OS/2
fdisk creates.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;V</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;verify</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Test whether partitions seem
correct. (See the third invocation type above.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;i</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;increment</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Number cylinders etc. starting
from 1 instead of 0.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;N</b>
<i>number</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Change only the single
partition indicated. For example: <br>
% sfdisk /dev/hdb &minus;N5 <br>
,,,* <br>
will make the fifth partition on /dev/hdb bootable
(&lsquo;active&rsquo;) and change nothing else. (Probably
this fifth partition is called /dev/hdb5, but you are free
to call it something else, like
&lsquo;/my_equipment/disks/2/5&rsquo; or so).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;A</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;activate</b> <i>number</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Make the indicated partition(s)
active, and all others inactive.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;c</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;id</b> <i>number</i> [<i>Id</i>]</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If no <i>Id</i> argument given:
print the partition Id of the indicated partition. If an
<i>Id</i> argument is present: change the type (Id) of the
indicated partition to the given value. This option has two
longer forms, <b>&minus;&minus;print&minus;id</b> and
<b>&minus;&minus;change&minus;id</b>. For example: <br>
% sfdisk --print-id /dev/hdb 5 <br>
6 <br>
% sfdisk --change-id /dev/hdb 5 83 <br>
OK <br>
first reports that /dev/hdb5 has Id 6, and then changes that
into 83.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;u</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;unit</b> <i>letter</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Interpret the input and show
the output in the units specified by <i>letter</i>. This
<i>letter</i> can be one of S, C, B or M, meaning Sectors,
Cylinders, Blocks and Megabytes, respectively. The default
is cylinders, at least when the geometry is known.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;x</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;show&minus;extended</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Also list non-primary extended
partitions on output, and expect descriptors for them on
input.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;C</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;cylinders</b> <i>cylinders</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specify the number of
cylinders, possibly overriding what the kernel thinks.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;H</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;heads</b> <i>heads</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specify the number of heads,
possibly overriding what the kernel thinks.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;S</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;sectors</b> <i>sectors</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specify the number of sectors,
possibly overriding what the kernel thinks.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;f</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;force</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Do what I say, even if it is
stupid.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;q</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;quiet</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Suppress warning messages.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;L</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;Linux</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Do not complain about things
irrelevant for Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;D</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;DOS</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">For DOS-compatibility: waste a
little space. (More precisely: if a partition cannot contain
sector 0, e.g. because that is the MBR of the device, or
contains the partition table of an extended partition, then
<b>sfdisk</b> would make it start the next sector. However,
when this option is given it skips to the start of the next
track, wasting for example 33 sectors (in case of 34
sectors/track), just like certain versions of DOS do.)
Certain Disk Managers and boot loaders (such as OSBS, but
not LILO or the OS/2 Boot Manager) also live in this empty
space, so maybe you want this option if you use one.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;E</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;DOS&minus;extended</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Take the starting sector
numbers of &quot;inner&quot; extended partitions to be
relative to the starting cylinder boundary of the outer one
(like some versions of DOS do), rather than relative to the
actual starting sector (like Linux does). (The fact that
there is a difference here means that one should always let
extended partitions start at cylinder boundaries if DOS and
Linux should interpret the partition table in the same way.
Of course one can only know where cylinder boundaries are
when one knows what geometry DOS will use for this block
device.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;IBM</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;leave&minus;last</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Certain IBM diagnostic programs
assume that they can use the last cylinder on a device for
disk-testing purposes. If you think you might ever run such
programs, use this option to tell <b>sfdisk</b> that it
should not allocate the last cylinder. Sometimes the last
cylinder contains a bad sector table.</p>

</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;R</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;re-read</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Only execute the BLKRRPART
ioctl (to make the kernel re-read the partition table). This
can be useful for checking in advance that the final
BLKRRPART will be successful, and also when you changed the
partition table &lsquo;by hand&rsquo; (e.g., using dd from a
backup). If the kernel complains (&lsquo;device busy for
revalidation (usage = 2)&rsquo;) then something still uses
the device, and you still have to unmount some file system,
or say swapoff to some swap partition.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;no&minus;reread</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">When starting a repartitioning
of a block device, <b>sfdisk</b> checks that this device is
not mounted, or in use as a swap device, and refuses to
continue if it is. This option suppresses the test. (On the
other hand, the <b>&minus;f</b> option would force
<b>sfdisk</b> to continue even when this test fails.)</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;in&minus;order</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;chained</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Caution, see warning section.
Every data partition is contained in the surrounding
partitions and disjoint from all others, but extended
partitions may lie outside (insofar as allowed by
all_logicals_inside_outermost_extended).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;onesector</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Caution, see warning section.
All data partitions are mutually disjoint; extended
partitions each use one sector only (except perhaps for the
outermost one).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;O</b> <i>file</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Just before writing the new
partition, output the sectors that are going to be
overwritten to <i>file</i> (where hopefully <i>file</i>
resides on another block device, or on a floppy).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;I</b> <i>file</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">After destroying your
filesystems with an unfortunate <b>sfdisk</b> command, you
would have been able to restore the old situation if only
you had preserved it using the <b>&minus;O</b> flag.</p>

<h2>THEORY
<a name="THEORY"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Block 0 of a
block device (the Master Boot Record) contains among other
things four partition descriptors. The partitions described
here are called <i>primary</i> partitions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A partition
descriptor has 6 fields:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">struct partition {</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">


<p>unsigned char bootable;</p><td width="28%"></td>
<td width="-20%"></td>
<td width="38%"></td>
<td width="8%"></td>
<td width="8%"></td>
<td width="38%">
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="28%"></td>
<td width="-20%"></td>
<td width="38%"></td>
<td width="8%"></td>
<td width="8%"></td>
<td width="38%">


<p>/* 0 or 0x80 */</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">hsc begin_hsc; <br>
unsigned char id; <br>
hsc end_hsc; <br>
unsigned int starting_sector; <br>
unsigned int nr_of_sectors; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The two hsc
fields indicate head, sector and cylinder of the begin and
the end of the partition. Since each hsc field only takes 3
bytes, only 24 bits are available, which does not suffice
for big block devices (say &gt; 8GB). In fact, due to the
wasteful representation (that uses a byte for the number of
heads, which is typically 16), problems already start with
0.5GB. However Linux does not use these fields, and problems
can arise only at boot time, before Linux has been started.
For more details, see the <b>lilo</b> documentation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Each partition
has a type, its &lsquo;Id&rsquo;, and if this type is 5 or f
(&lsquo;<i>extended partition</i>&rsquo;) the starting
sector of the partition again contains 4 partition
descriptors. MSDOS only uses the first two of these: the
first one an actual data partition, and the second one again
an extended partition (or empty). In this way one gets a
chain of extended partitions. Other operating systems have
slightly different conventions. Linux also accepts type 85
as equivalent to 5 and f - this can be useful if one wants
to have extended partitions under Linux past the 1024
cylinder boundary, without DOS FDISK hanging. (If there is
no good reason, you should just use 5, which is understood
by other systems.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Partitions that
are not primary or extended are called <i>logical</i>.
Often, one cannot boot from logical partitions (because the
process of finding them is more involved than just looking
at the MBR). Note that of an extended partition only the Id
and the start are used. There are various conventions about
what to write in the other fields. One should not try to use
extended partitions for data storage or swap.</p>

<h2>INPUT FORMAT
<a name="INPUT FORMAT"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>sfdisk</b>
reads lines of the form</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">&lt;start&gt; &lt;size&gt;
&lt;id&gt; &lt;bootable&gt; &lt;c,h,s&gt; &lt;c,h,s&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">where each line fills one
partition descriptor.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Fields are
separated by whitespace, or comma or semicolon possibly
followed by whitespace; initial and trailing whitespace is
ignored. Numbers can be octal, decimal or hexadecimal,
decimal is default. When a field is absent or empty, a
default value is used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
&lt;c,h,s&gt; parts can (and probably should) be omitted -
<b>sfdisk</b> computes them from &lt;start&gt; and
&lt;size&gt; and the block device geometry as given by the
kernel or specified using the &minus;H, &minus;S, &minus;C
flags.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Bootable is
specified as [*|&minus;], with as default not-bootable. (The
value of this field is irrelevant for Linux - when Linux
runs it has been booted already - but might play a role for
certain boot loaders and for other operating systems. For
example, when there are several primary DOS partitions, DOS
assigns C: to the first among these that is bootable.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Id is given in
hex, without the 0x prefix, or is [E|S|L|X], where L
(LINUX_NATIVE (83)) is the default, S is LINUX_SWAP (82), E
is EXTENDED_PARTITION (5), and X is LINUX_EXTENDED (85).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The default
value of start is the first nonassigned
sector/cylinder/...</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The default
value of size is as much as possible (until next partition
or end-of-device).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">However, for
the four partitions inside an extended partition, the
defaults are: Linux partition, Extended partition, Empty,
Empty.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">But when the
&minus;N option (change a single partition only) is given,
the default for each field is its previous value.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A
&rsquo;+&rsquo; can be specified instead of a number for
size, which means as much as possible. This is useful with
the &minus;N option.</p>

<h2>EXAMPLE
<a name="EXAMPLE"></a>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The command</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">sfdisk /dev/hdc &lt;&lt; EOF

Inside the extended partition there are four Linux logical
partitions, three of 130 cylinders and one covering the
rest.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">With the
&minus;x option, the number of input lines must be a
multiple of 4: you have to list the two empty partitions
that you never want using two blank lines. Without the
&minus;x option, you give one line for the partitions inside
a extended partition, instead of four, and terminate with
end-of-file (^D). (And <b>sfdisk</b> will assume that your
input line represents the first of four, that the second one
is extended, and the 3rd and 4th are empty.)</p>

<h2>CAUTION WARNINGS
<a name="CAUTION WARNINGS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The options
marked with caution in the manual page are dangerous. For
example not all functionality is completely implemented,
which can be a reason for unexpected results.</p>

<h2>DOS 6.x WARNING
<a name="DOS 6.x WARNING"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The DOS 6.x
FORMAT command looks for some information in the first
sector of the data area of the partition, and treats this
information as more reliable than the information in the
partition table. DOS FORMAT expects DOS FDISK to clear the
first 512 bytes of the data area of a partition whenever a
size change occurs. DOS FORMAT will look at this extra
information even if the /U flag is given -- we consider this
a bug in DOS FORMAT and DOS FDISK.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The bottom line
is that if you use sfdisk to change the size of a DOS
partition table entry, then you must also use <b>dd</b> to
zero the first 512 bytes of that partition before using DOS
FORMAT to format the partition. For example, if you were
using sfdisk to make a DOS partition table entry for
/dev/hda1, then (after exiting sfdisk and rebooting Linux so
that the partition table information is valid) you would use
the command &quot;dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/hda1 bs=512
count=1&quot; to zero the first 512 bytes of the partition.
<b>BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL</b> if you use the <b>dd</b>
command, since a small typo can make all of the data on your
block device useless.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For best
results, you should always use an OS-specific partition
table program. For example, you should make DOS partitions
with the DOS FDISK program and Linux partitions with the
Linux sfdisk program.</p>

<h2>DRDOS WARNINGS
<a name="DRDOS WARNINGS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Stephen Tweedie
reported (930515): &lsquo;Most reports of superblock
corruption turn out to be due to bad partitioning, with one
filesystem overrunning the start of the next and corrupting
its superblock. I have even had this problem with the
supposedly-reliable DRDOS. This was quite possibly due to
DRDOS-6.0&rsquo;s FDISK command. Unless I created a blank
track or cylinder between the DRDOS partition and the
immediately following one, DRDOS would happily stamp all
over the start of the next partition. Mind you, as long as I
keep a little free device space after any DRDOS partition, I
don&rsquo;t have any other problems with the two coexisting
on the one drive.&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A. V. Le Blanc
writes in README.efdisk: &lsquo;Dr. DOS 5.0 and 6.0 has been
reported to have problems cooperating with Linux, and with
this version of efdisk in particular. This efdisk sets the
system type to hexadecimal 81. Dr. DOS seems to confuse this
with hexadecimal 1, a DOS code. If you use Dr. DOS, use the
efdisk command &rsquo;t&rsquo; to change the system code of
any Linux partitions to some number less than hexadecimal
80; I suggest 41 and 42 for the moment.&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A. V. Le Blanc
writes in his README.fdisk: &lsquo;DR-DOS 5.0 and 6.0 are
reported to have difficulties with partition ID codes of 80
or more. The Linux &lsquo;fdisk&rsquo; used to set the
system type of new partitions to hexadecimal 81. DR-DOS
seems to confuse this with hexadecimal 1, a DOS code. The
values 82 for swap and 83 for file systems should not cause
problems with DR-DOS. If they do, you may use the
&lsquo;fdisk&rsquo; command &lsquo;t&rsquo; to change the
system code of any Linux partitions to some number less than
hexadecimal 80; I suggest 42 and 43 for the
moment.&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In fact, it
seems that only 4 bits are significant for the DRDOS FDISK,
so that for example 11 and 21 are listed as DOS 2.0.
However, DRDOS itself seems to use the full byte. I have not
been able to reproduce any corruption with DRDOS or its
fdisk.</p>
