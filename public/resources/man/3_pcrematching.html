<h2>PCRE MATCHING ALGORITHMS
<a name="PCRE MATCHING ALGORITHMS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This document
describes the two different algorithms that are available in
PCRE for matching a compiled regular expression against a
given subject string. The &quot;standard&quot; algorithm is
the one provided by the <b>pcre_exec()</b>,
<b>pcre16_exec()</b> and <b>pcre32_exec()</b> functions.
These work in the same as as Perl&rsquo;s matching function,
and provide a Perl-compatible matching operation. The
just-in-time (JIT) optimization that is described in the
<b>pcrejit</b> documentation is compatible with these
functions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">An alternative
algorithm is provided by the <b>pcre_dfa_exec()</b>,
<b>pcre16_dfa_exec()</b> and <b>pcre32_dfa_exec()</b>
functions; they operate in a different way, and are not
Perl-compatible. This alternative has advantages and
disadvantages compared with the standard algorithm, and
these are described below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When there is
only one possible way in which a given subject string can
match a pattern, the two algorithms give the same answer. A
difference arises, however, when there are multiple
possibilities. For example, if the pattern</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">^&lt;.*&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">is matched
against the string</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&lt;something&gt;
&lt;something else&gt; &lt;something further&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">there are three
possible answers. The standard algorithm finds only one of
them, whereas the alternative algorithm finds all three.</p>

<h2>REGULAR EXPRESSIONS AS TREES
<a name="REGULAR EXPRESSIONS AS TREES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The set of
strings that are matched by a regular expression can be
represented as a tree structure. An unlimited repetition in
the pattern makes the tree of infinite size, but it is still
a tree. Matching the pattern to a given subject string (from
a given starting point) can be thought of as a search of the
tree. There are two ways to search a tree: depth-first and
breadth-first, and these correspond to the two matching
algorithms provided by PCRE.</p>

<h2>THE STANDARD MATCHING ALGORITHM
<a name="THE STANDARD MATCHING ALGORITHM"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In the
terminology of Jeffrey Friedl&rsquo;s book &quot;Mastering
Regular Expressions&quot;, the standard algorithm is an
&quot;NFA algorithm&quot;. It conducts a depth-first search
of the pattern tree. That is, it proceeds along a single
path through the tree, checking that the subject matches
what is required. When there is a mismatch, the algorithm
tries any alternatives at the current point, and if they all
fail, it backs up to the previous branch point in the tree,
and tries the next alternative branch at that level. This
often involves backing up (moving to the left) in the
subject string as well. The order in which repetition
branches are tried is controlled by the greedy or ungreedy
nature of the quantifier.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If a leaf node
is reached, a matching string has been found, and at that
point the algorithm stops. Thus, if there is more than one
possible match, this algorithm returns the first one that it
finds. Whether this is the shortest, the longest, or some
intermediate length depends on the way the greedy and
ungreedy repetition quantifiers are specified in the
pattern.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Because it ends
up with a single path through the tree, it is relatively
straightforward for this algorithm to keep track of the
substrings that are matched by portions of the pattern in
parentheses. This provides support for capturing parentheses
and back references.</p>

<h2>THE ALTERNATIVE MATCHING ALGORITHM
<a name="THE ALTERNATIVE MATCHING ALGORITHM"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This algorithm
conducts a breadth-first search of the tree. Starting from
the first matching point in the subject, it scans the
subject string from left to right, once, character by
character, and as it does this, it remembers all the paths
through the tree that represent valid matches. In
Friedl&rsquo;s terminology, this is a kind of &quot;DFA
algorithm&quot;, though it is not implemented as a
traditional finite state machine (it keeps multiple states
active simultaneously).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Although the
general principle of this matching algorithm is that it
scans the subject string only once, without backtracking,
there is one exception: when a lookaround assertion is
encountered, the characters following or preceding the
current point have to be independently inspected.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The scan
continues until either the end of the subject is reached, or
there are no more unterminated paths. At this point,
terminated paths represent the different matching
possibilities (if there are none, the match has failed).
Thus, if there is more than one possible match, this
algorithm finds all of them, and in particular, it finds the
longest. The matches are returned in decreasing order of
length. There is an option to stop the algorithm after the
first match (which is necessarily the shortest) is
found.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that all
the matches that are found start at the same point in the
subject. If the pattern</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">cat(er(pillar)?)?</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">is matched
against the string &quot;the caterpillar catchment&quot;,
the result will be the three strings
&quot;caterpillar&quot;, &quot;cater&quot;, and
&quot;cat&quot; that start at the fifth character of the
subject. The algorithm does not automatically move on to
find matches that start at later positions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There are a
number of features of PCRE regular expressions that are not
supported by the alternative matching algorithm. They are as
follows:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">1. Because the
algorithm finds all possible matches, the greedy or ungreedy
nature of repetition quantifiers is not relevant. Greedy and
ungreedy quantifiers are treated in exactly the same way.
However, possessive quantifiers can make a difference when
what follows could also match what is quantified, for
example in a pattern like this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">^a++\w!</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This pattern
matches &quot;aaab!&quot; but not &quot;aaa!&quot;, which
would be matched by a non-possessive quantifier. Similarly,
if an atomic group is present, it is matched as if it were a
standalone pattern at the current point, and the longest
match is then &quot;locked in&quot; for the rest of the
overall pattern.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">2. When dealing
with multiple paths through the tree simultaneously, it is
not straightforward to keep track of captured substrings for
the different matching possibilities, and PCRE&rsquo;s
implementation of this algorithm does not attempt to do
this. This means that no captured substrings are
available.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">3. Because no
substrings are captured, back references within the pattern
are not supported, and cause errors if encountered.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">4. For the same
reason, conditional expressions that use a backreference as
the condition or test for a specific group recursion are not
supported.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">5. Because many
paths through the tree may be active, the \K escape
sequence, which resets the start of the match when
encountered (but may be on some paths and not on others), is
not supported. It causes an error if encountered.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">6. Callouts are
supported, but the value of the <i>capture_top</i> field is
always 1, and the value of the <i>capture_last</i> field is
always -1.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">7. The \C
escape sequence, which (in the standard algorithm) always
matches a single data unit, even in UTF-8, UTF-16 or UTF-32
modes, is not supported in these modes, because the
alternative algorithm moves through the subject string one
character (not data unit) at a time, for all active paths
through the tree.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">8. Except for
(*FAIL), the backtracking control verbs such as (*PRUNE) are
not supported. (*FAIL) is supported, and behaves like a
failing negative assertion.</p>

<h2>ADVANTAGES OF THE ALTERNATIVE ALGORITHM
<a name="ADVANTAGES OF THE ALTERNATIVE ALGORITHM"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Using the
alternative matching algorithm provides the following
advantages:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">1. All possible
matches (at a single point in the subject) are automatically
found, and in particular, the longest match is found. To
find more than one match using the standard algorithm, you
have to do kludgy things with callouts.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">2. Because the
alternative algorithm scans the subject string just once,
and never needs to backtrack (except for lookbehinds), it is
possible to pass very long subject strings to the matching
function in several pieces, checking for partial matching
each time. Although it is possible to do multi-segment
matching using the standard algorithm by retaining partially
matched substrings, it is more complicated. The
<b>pcrepartial</b> documentation gives details of partial
matching and discusses multi-segment matching.</p>

<h2>DISADVANTAGES OF THE ALTERNATIVE ALGORITHM
<a name="DISADVANTAGES OF THE ALTERNATIVE ALGORITHM"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The alternative
algorithm suffers from a number of disadvantages:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">1. It is
substantially slower than the standard algorithm. This is
partly because it has to search for all possible matches,
but is also because it is less susceptible to
optimization.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">2. Capturing
parentheses and back references are not supported.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">3. Although
atomic groups are supported, their use does not provide the
performance advantage that it does for the standard
algorithm.</p>
