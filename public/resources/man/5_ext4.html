<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The second,
third, and fourth extended file systems, or ext2, ext3, and
ext4 as they are commonly known, are Linux file systems that
have historically been the default file system for many
Linux distributions. They are general purpose file systems
that have been designed for extensibility and backwards
compatibility. In particular, file systems previously
intended for use with the ext2 and ext3 file systems can be
mounted using the ext4 file system driver, and indeed in
many modern Linux distributions, the ext4 file system driver
has been configured handle mount requests for ext2 and ext3
file systems.</p>

<h2>FILE SYSTEM FEATURES
<a name="FILE SYSTEM FEATURES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A file system
formated for ext2, ext3, or ext4 can be have some collection
of the follow file system feature flags enabled. Some of
these features are not supported by all implementations of
the ext2, ext3, and ext4 file system drivers, depending on
Linux kernel version in use. On other operating systems,
such as the GNU/HURD or FreeBSD, only a very restrictive set
of file system features may be supported in their
implementations of ext2.</p>

<td width="8%">


<p><b>64bit</b></p></td>
<td width="3%"></td>
<td width="60%">


<p>Enables the file system to be larger than 2^32 blocks.
This feature is set automatically, as needed, but it can be
useful to specify this feature explicitly if the file system
might need to be resized larger than 2^32 blocks, even if it
was smaller than that threshold when it was originally
created. Note that some older kernels and older versions of
e2fsprogs will not support file systems with this ext4
feature enabled.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:29%;"><b>bigalloc</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:40%;">This ext4 feature enables
clustered block allocation, so that the unit of allocation
is a power of two number of blocks. That is, each bit in the
what had traditionally been known as the block allocation
bitmap now indicates whether a cluster is in use or not,
where a cluster is by default composed of 16 blocks. This
feature can decrease the time spent on doing block
allocation and brings smaller fragmentation, especially for
large files. The size can be specified using the <b>&minus;C
option.</b></p>


<p style="margin-left:40%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Warning:</b>
The bigalloc feature is still under development, and may not
be fully supported with your kernel or may have various
bugs. Please see the web page
http://ext4.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Bigalloc for details.
May clash with delayed allocation (see
<b>nodelalloc</b>mount<b>option).</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:40%; margin-top: 1em">This feature
requires that the <b>extent</b> features be enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-left:29%;"><b>dir_index</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:40%;">Use hashed b-trees to speed up
name lookups in large directories. This feature is supported
by ext3 and ext4 file systems, and is ignored by ext2 file
systems.</p>

<p style="margin-left:29%;"><b>dir_nlink</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:40%;">This ext4 feature allows more
than 65000 subdirectories per directory.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"

<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="29%"></td>
<td width="9%">


<p><b>extent</b></p></td>
<td width="2%"></td>
<td width="60%">


<p>This ext4 feature allows the mapping of logical block
numbers for a particular inode to physical blocks on the
storage device to be stored using an extent tree, which is a
more efficient data structure than the traditional indirect
block scheme used by the ext2 and ext3 file systems. The use
of the extent tree decreases metadata block overhead,
improves file system performance, and decreases the needed
to run <b>e2fsck</b>(8) on the file system. (Note: both
<b>extent</b> and <b>extents</b> are accepted as valid names
for this feature for historical/backwards compatibility
reasons.)</p> </td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:29%;"><b>extra_isize</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:40%;">This ext4 feature reserves a
specific amount of space in each inode for extended metadata
such as nanosecond timestamps and file creation time, even
if the current kernel does not current need to reserve this
much space. Without this feature, the kernel will reserve
the amount of space for features currently it currently
needs, and the rest may be consumed by extended
attributes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:40%; margin-top: 1em">For this
feature to be useful the inode size must be 256 bytes in
size or larger.</p>

<p style="margin-left:29%;"><b>ext_attr</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:40%;">This feature enables the use of
extended attributes. This feature is supported by ext2,
ext3, and ext4.</p>

<p style="margin-left:29%;"><b>filetype</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:40%;">This feature enables the
storage file type information in directory entries. This
feature is supported by ext2, ext3, and ext4.</p>


<p style="margin-left:29%; margin-top: 1em"><b>flex_bg</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:40%;">This ext4 feature allows the
per-block group metadata (allocation bitmaps and inode
tables) to be placed anywhere on the storage media. In
addition, <b>mke2fs</b> will place the per-block group
metadata together starting at the first block group of each
&quot;flex_bg group&quot;. The size of the flex_bg group can
be specified using the <b>&minus;G</b> option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:29%;"><b>has_journal</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:40%;">Create a journal to ensure
filesystem consistency even across unclean shutdowns.
Setting the filesystem feature is equivalent to using the
<b>&minus;j</b> option. This feature is supported by ext3
and ext4, and ignored by the ext2 file system driver.</p>

<p style="margin-left:29%;"><b>huge_file</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:40%;">This ext4 feature allows files
to be larger than 2 terabytes in size.</p>

<p style="margin-left:29%;"><b>journal_dev</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:40%;">This feature is enabled on the
superblock found on an external journal device. The block
size for the external journal must be the same as the file
system which uses it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:40%; margin-top: 1em">The external
journal device can be used by a file system by specifying
the <b>&minus;J device=</b>&lt;external-device&gt; option to
<b>mke2fs</b>(8) or <b>tune2fs(8).</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:29%;"><b>large_file</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:40%;">This feature flag is set
automatically by modern kernels when a file larger than 2
gigabytes is created. Very old kernels could not handle
large files, so this feature flag was used to prohibit those
kernels from mounting file systems that they could not
understand.</p>

<p style="margin-left:29%;"><b>meta_bg</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:40%;">This ext4 feature allows file
systems to be resized on-line without explicitly needing to
reserve space for growth in the size of the block group
descriptors. This scheme is also used to resize file systems
which are larger than 2^32 blocks. It is not recommended
that this feature be set when a file system is created,
since this alternate method of storing the block group
descriptor will slow down the time needed to mount the file
system, and newer kernels can automatically set this feature
as necessary when doing an online resize and no more
reserved space is available in the resize inode.</p>

<p><b>mmp</b></p></td>
<td width="6%"></td>

<p>This ext4 feature provides multiple mount protection
(MMP). MMP helps to protect the filesystem from being
multiply mounted and is useful in shared storage
environments.</p> </td>
<td width="9%">
</td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:29%;"><b>resize_inode</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:40%;">This file system feature
indicates that space has been reserved so the block group
descriptor table can be extended by the file system is
resized while the file system is mounted. The online resize
operation is carried out by the kernel, triggered, by
<b>resize2fs</b>(8). By default <b>mke2fs</b> will attempt
to reserve enough space so that the filesystem may grow to
1024 times its initial size. This can be changed using the
<b>resize</b> extended option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:40%; margin-top: 1em">This feature
requires that the <b>sparse_super</b> feature be
enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-left:29%;"><b>sparse_super</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:40%;">This file system feature is set
on all modern ext2, ext3, and ext4 file system. It indicates
that backup copies of the superblock and block group
descriptors be present only on a few block groups, and not
all of them.</p>

<p style="margin-left:29%;"><b>uninit_bg</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:40%;">This ext4 file system feature
indicates that the block group descriptors will be protected
using checksums, making it safe for <b>mke2fs</b>(8) to
create a file system without initializing all of the block
groups. The kernel will keep a high watermark of unused
inodes, and initialize inode tables and block lazily. This
feature speeds up the time to check the file system using
<b>e2fsck</b>(8), and it also speeds up the time required
for <b>mke2fs</b>(8) to create the file system.</p>

<h2>MOUNT OPTIONS
<a name="MOUNT OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This section
describes mount options which are specific to ext2, ext3,
and ext4. Other generic mount options may be used as well;
see <b>mount</b>(8) for details.</p>

<h2>Mount options for ext2
<a name="Mount options for ext2"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
&lsquo;ext2&rsquo; filesystem is the standard Linux
filesystem. Since Linux 2.5.46, for most mount options the
default is determined by the filesystem superblock. Set them
with <b>tune2fs</b>(8). <b><br>
acl</b>|<b>noacl</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Support POSIX Access Control
Lists (or not).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>bsddf</b>|<b>minixdf</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set the behavior for the
<i>statfs</i> system call. The <b>minixdf</b> behavior is to
return in the <i>f_blocks</i> field the total number of
blocks of the filesystem, while the <b>bsddf</b> behavior
(which is the default) is to subtract the overhead blocks
used by the ext2 filesystem and not available for file
storage. Thus</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">% mount /k
&minus;o minixdf; df /k; umount /k</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">% mount /k
&minus;o bsddf; df /k; umount /k</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">(Note that this
example shows that one can add command line options to the
options given in <i>/etc/fstab</i>.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>check=none</b> or
<b>nocheck</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">No checking is done at mount
time. This is the default. This is fast. It is wise to
invoke <b>e2fsck</b>(8) every now and then, e.g. at boot
time. The non-default behavior is unsupported (check=normal
and check=strict options have been removed). Note that these
mount options don&rsquo;t have to be supported if ext4
kernel driver is used for ext2 and ext3 filesystems.</p>

<td width="15%">
</td></tr>
</table>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>errors=</b>{<b>continue</b>|<b>remount-ro</b>|<b>panic</b>}</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Define the behavior when an
error is encountered. (Either ignore errors and just mark
the filesystem erroneous and continue, or remount the
filesystem read-only, or panic and halt the system.) The
default is set in the filesystem superblock, and can be
changed using <b>tune2fs</b>(8).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>grpid</b>|<b>bsdgroups</b>
and <b>nogrpid</b>|<b>sysvgroups</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">These options define what group
id a newly created file gets. When <b>grpid</b> is set, it
takes the group id of the directory in which it is created;
otherwise (the default) it takes the fsgid of the current
process, unless the directory has the setgid bit set, in
which case it takes the gid from the parent directory, and
also gets the setgid bit set if it is a directory
itself.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>grpquota</b>|<b>noquota</b>|<b>quota</b>|<b>usrquota</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The usrquota (same as quota)
mount option enables user quota support on the filesystem.
grpquota enables group quotas support. You need the quota
utilities to actually enable and manage the quota
system.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>nouid32</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Disables 32-bit UIDs and GIDs.
This is for interoperability with older kernels which only
store and expect 16-bit values.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>oldalloc</b> or
<b>orlov</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Use old allocator or Orlov
allocator for new inodes. Orlov is default.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>resgid=</b><i>n</i> and
<b>resuid=</b><i>n</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The ext2 filesystem reserves a
certain percentage of the available space (by default 5%,
see <b>mke2fs</b>(8) and <b>tune2fs</b>(8)). These options
determine who can use the reserved blocks. (Roughly: whoever
has the specified uid, or belongs to the specified
group.)</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"

<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="6%">


<p><b>sb=</b><i>n</i></p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="69%">


<p>Instead of block 1, use block <i>n</i> as superblock.
This could be useful when the filesystem has been damaged.
(Earlier, copies of the superblock would be made every 8192
blocks: in block 1, 8193, 16385, ... (and one got thousands
of copies on a big filesystem). Since version 1.08,
<b>mke2fs</b> has a &minus;s (sparse superblock) option to
reduce the number of backup superblocks, and since version
1.15 this is the default. Note that this may mean that ext2
filesystems created by a recent <b>mke2fs</b> cannot be
mounted r/w under Linux 2.0.*.) The block number here uses
1&nbsp;k units. Thus, if you want to use logical block 32768
on a filesystem with 4&nbsp;k blocks, use
&quot;sb=131072&quot;.</p> </td>

extended attributes (or not).</p>

<h2>Mount options for ext3
<a name="Mount options for ext3"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The ext3
filesystem is a version of the ext2 filesystem which has
been enhanced with journaling. It supports the same options
as ext2 as well as the following additions: <b><br>
journal=update</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Update the ext3
filesystem&rsquo;s journal to the current format.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>journal=inum</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">When a journal already exists,
this option is ignored. Otherwise, it specifies the number
of the inode which will represent the ext3
filesystem&rsquo;s journal file; ext3 will create a new
journal, overwriting the old contents of the file whose
inode number is <i>inum</i>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>journal_dev=devnum</b>/<b>journal_path=path</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">When the external journal
device&rsquo;s major/minor numbers have changed, these
options allow the user to specify the new journal location.
The journal device is identified either through its new
major/minor numbers encoded in devnum, or via a path to the
device.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>norecovery</b>/<b>noload</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Don&rsquo;t load the journal on
mounting. Note that if the filesystem was not unmounted
cleanly, skipping the journal replay will lead to the
filesystem containing inconsistencies that can lead to any
number of problems.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>data=</b>{<b>journal</b>|<b>ordered</b>|<b>writeback</b>}</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specifies the journaling mode
for file data. Metadata is always journaled. To use modes
other than <b>ordered</b> on the root filesystem, pass the
mode to the kernel as boot parameter, e.g.
<i>rootflags=data=journal</i>. <b><br>
journal</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">All data is committed into the
journal prior to being written into the main filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>ordered</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">This is the default mode. All
data is forced directly out to the main file system prior to
its metadata being committed to the journal.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>writeback</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Data ordering is not preserved
&ndash; data may be written into the main filesystem after
its metadata has been committed to the journal. This is
rumoured to be the highest-throughput option. It guarantees
internal filesystem integrity, however it can allow old data
to appear in files after a crash and journal recovery.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>data_err=ignore</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Just print an error message if
an error occurs in a file data buffer in ordered mode.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>data_err=abort</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Abort the journal if an error
occurs in a file data buffer in ordered mode.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>barrier=0</b> /
<b>barrier=1</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This disables / enables the use
of write barriers in the jbd code. barrier=0 disables,
barrier=1 enables (default). This also requires an IO stack
which can support barriers, and if jbd gets an error on a
barrier write, it will disable barriers again with a
warning. Write barriers enforce proper on-disk ordering of
journal commits, making volatile disk write caches safe to
use, at some performance penalty. If your disks are
battery-backed in one way or another, disabling barriers may
safely improve performance.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>commit=</b><i>nrsec</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Sync all data and metadata
every <i>nrsec</i> seconds. The default value is 5 seconds.
Zero means default.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>user_xattr</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Enable Extended User
Attributes. See the <b>attr</b>(5) manual page.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>usrjquota=aquota.user</b>|<b>grpjquota=aquota.group</b>|<b>jqfmt=vfsv0</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Apart from the old quota system
(as in ext2, jqfmt=vfsold aka version 1 quota) ext3 also
supports journaled quotas (version 2 quota). jqfmt=vfsv0
enables journaled quotas. For journaled quotas the mount
options usrjquota=aquota.user and grpjquota=aquota.group are
required to tell the quota system which quota database files
to use. Journaled quotas have the advantage that even after
a crash no quota check is required.</p>

<h2>Mount options for ext4

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The ext4
filesystem is an advanced level of the ext3 filesystem which
incorporates scalability and reliability enhancements for

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The options
<b>journal_dev, norecovery, noload, data, commit, orlov,

usrjquota, grpjquota and jqfmt</b> are backwardly compatible
with ext3 or ext2. <b><br>
journal_checksum</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Enable checksumming of the
journal transactions. This will allow the recovery code in
e2fsck and the kernel to detect corruption in the kernel. It
is a compatible change and will be ignored by older
kernels.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>journal_async_commit</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Commit block can be written to
disk without waiting for descriptor blocks. If enabled older
kernels cannot mount the device. This will enable
&rsquo;journal_checksum&rsquo; internally.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>barrier=0</b> /
<b>barrier=1</b> / <b>barrier</b> / <b>nobarrier</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">These mount options have the
same effect as in ext3. The mount options
&quot;barrier&quot; and &quot;nobarrier&quot; are added for
consistency with other ext4 mount options.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The ext4
filesystem enables write barriers by default.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>inode_readahead_blks=</b><i>n</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This tuning parameter controls
the maximum number of inode table blocks that ext4&rsquo;s
inode table readahead algorithm will pre-read into the
buffer cache. The value must be a power of 2. The default
value is 32 blocks.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>stripe=</b><i>n</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Number of filesystem blocks
that mballoc will try to use for allocation size and
alignment. For RAID5/6 systems this should be the number of
data disks * RAID chunk size in filesystem blocks.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>delalloc</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Deferring block allocation
until write-out time.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>nodelalloc</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Disable delayed allocation.
Blocks are allocated when data is copied from user to page
cache.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>max_batch_time=</b><i>usec</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Maximum amount of time ext4
should wait for additional filesystem operations to be batch
together with a synchronous write operation. Since a
synchronous write operation is going to force a commit and
then a wait for the I/O complete, it doesn&rsquo;t cost
much, and can be a huge throughput win, we wait for a small
amount of time to see if any other transactions can
piggyback on the synchronous write. The algorithm used is
designed to automatically tune for the speed of the disk, by
measuring the amount of time (on average) that it takes to
finish committing a transaction. Call this time the
&quot;commit time&quot;. If the time that the transaction
has been running is less than the commit time, ext4 will try
sleeping for the commit time to see if other operations will
join the transaction. The commit time is capped by the
max_batch_time, which defaults to 15000&nbsp;&micro;s
(15&nbsp;ms). This optimization can be turned off entirely
by setting max_batch_time to 0.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>min_batch_time=</b><i>usec</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This parameter sets the commit
time (as described above) to be at least min_batch_time. It
defaults to zero microseconds. Increasing this parameter may
improve the throughput of multi-threaded, synchronous
workloads on very fast disks, at the cost of increasing
latency.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>journal_ioprio=</b><i>prio</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The I/O priority (from 0 to 7,
where 0 is the highest priority) which should be used for
I/O operations submitted by kjournald2 during a commit
operation. This defaults to 3, which is a slightly higher
priority than the default I/O priority.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>auto_da_alloc</b>|<b>noauto_da_alloc</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Many broken applications
don&rsquo;t use fsync() when replacing existing files via
patterns such as</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">fd =
open(&quot;foo.new&quot;)/write(fd,...)/close(fd)/
rename(&quot;foo.new&quot;, &quot;foo&quot;)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">or worse
yet</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">fd =
open(&quot;foo&quot;, O_TRUNC)/write(fd,...)/close(fd).</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If
auto_da_alloc is enabled, ext4 will detect the
replace-via-rename and replace-via-truncate patterns and
force that any delayed allocation blocks are allocated such
that at the next journal commit, in the default data=ordered
mode, the data blocks of the new file are forced to disk
before the rename() operation is committed. This provides
roughly the same level of guarantees as ext3, and avoids the
&quot;zero-length&quot; problem that can happen when a
system crashes before the delayed allocation blocks are
forced to disk.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>noinit_itable</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Do not initialize any
uninitialized inode table blocks in the background. This
feature may be used by installation CD&rsquo;s so that the
install process can complete as quickly as possible; the
inode table initialization process would then be deferred
until the next time the filesystem is mounted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>init_itable=n</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The lazy itable init code will
wait n times the number of milliseconds it took to zero out
the previous block group&rsquo;s inode table. This minimizes
the impact on system performance while the
filesystem&rsquo;s inode table is being initialized.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>discard</b>/<b>nodiscard</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Controls whether ext4 should
issue discard/TRIM commands to the underlying block device
when blocks are freed. This is useful for SSD devices and
sparse/thinly-provisioned LUNs, but it is off by default
until sufficient testing has been done.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>nouid32</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Disables 32-bit UIDs and GIDs.
This is for interoperability with older kernels which only
store and expect 16-bit values.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>block_validity</b>/<b>noblock_validity</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This options allows to
enables/disables the in-kernel facility for tracking
filesystem metadata blocks within internal data structures.
This allows multi-block allocator and other routines to
quickly locate extents which might overlap with filesystem
metadata blocks. This option is intended for debugging
purposes and since it negatively affects the performance, it
is off by default.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>dioread_lock</b>/<b>dioread_nolock</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Controls whether or not ext4
should use the DIO read locking. If the dioread_nolock
option is specified ext4 will allocate uninitialized extent
before buffer write and convert the extent to initialized
after IO completes. This approach allows ext4 code to avoid
using inode mutex, which improves scalability on high speed
storages. However this does not work with data journaling
and dioread_nolock option will be ignored with kernel
warning. Note that dioread_nolock code path is only used for
extent-based files. Because of the restrictions this options
comprises it is off by default (e.g. dioread_lock).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>max_dir_size_kb=n</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This limits the size of the
directories so that any attempt to expand them beyond the
specified limit in kilobytes will cause an ENOSPC error.
This is useful in memory-constrained environments, where a
very large directory can cause severe performance problems
or even provoke the Out Of Memory killer. (For example, if
there is only 512&nbsp;MB memory available, a 176&nbsp;MB
directory may seriously cramp the system&rsquo;s style.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>i_version</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Enable 64-bit inode version
support. This option is off by default.</p>
