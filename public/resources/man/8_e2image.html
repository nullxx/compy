Save critical ext2/ext3/ext4 filesystem metadata to a
file</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>e2image</b> program will save critical ext2, ext3, or
ext4 filesystem metadata located on <i>device</i> to a file
specified by <i>image-file</i>. The image file may be
examined by <b>dumpe2fs</b> and <b>debugfs</b>, by using the
<b>&minus;i</b> option to those programs. This can assist an
expert in recovering catastrophically corrupted filesystems.
In the future, e2fsck will be enhanced to be able to use the
image file to help recover a badly damaged filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When saving an
e2image for debugging purposes, using either the
<b>&minus;r</b> or <b>&minus;Q</b> options, the filesystem
must be unmounted or be mounted read/only, in order for the
image file to be in a consistent state. This requirement can
be overriden using the <b>&minus;f</b> option, but the
resulting image file is very likely not going to be
useful.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If
<i>image-file</i> is &minus;, then the output of
<b>e2image</b> will be sent to standard output, so that the
output can be piped to another program, such as
<b>gzip</b>(1). (Note that this is currently only supported
when creating a raw image file using the <b>&minus;r</b>
option, since the process of creating a normal image file,
or QCOW2 image currently requires random access to the file,
which cannot be done using a pipe. This restriction will
hopefully be lifted in a future version of
<b>e2image</b>.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is a very
good idea to create image files for all of filesystems on a
system and save the partition layout (which can be generated
using the <b>fdisk &minus;l</b> command) at regular
intervals --- at boot time, and/or every week or so. The
image file should be stored on some filesystem other than
the filesystem whose data it contains, to ensure that this
data is accessible in the case where the filesystem has been
badly damaged.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To save disk
space, <b>e2image</b> creates the image file as a sparse
file, or in QCOW2 format. Hence, if the sparse image file
needs to be copied to another location, it should either be
compressed first or copied using the
<b>&minus;&minus;sparse=always</b> option to the GNU version
of <b>cp</b>. This does not apply to the QCOW2 image, which
is not sparse.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The size of an
ext2 image file depends primarily on the size of the
filesystems and how many inodes are in use. For a typical 10
gigabyte filesystem, with 200,000 inodes in use out of 1.2
million inodes, the image file will be approximately 35
megabytes; a 4 gigabyte filesystem with 15,000 inodes in use
out of 550,000 inodes will result in a 3 megabyte image
file. Image files tend to be quite compressible; an image
file taking up 32 megabytes of space on disk will generally
compress down to 3 or 4 megabytes.</p>

<h2>RESTORING FILESYSTEM METADATA USING AN IMAGE FILE
<a name="RESTORING FILESYSTEM METADATA USING AN IMAGE FILE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>&minus;I</b> option will cause e2image to install the
metadata stored in the image file back to the device. It can
be used to restore the filesystem metadata back to the
device in emergency situations.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>WARNING!!!!</b>
The <b>&minus;I</b> option should only be used as a
desperation measure when other alternatives have failed. If
the filesystem has changed since the image file was created,
data <b>will</b> be lost. In general, you should make a full
image backup of the filesystem first, in case you wish to
try other recovery strategies afterwards.</p>

<h2>RAW IMAGE FILES
<a name="RAW IMAGE FILES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>&minus;r</b> option will create a raw image file instead
of a normal image file. A raw image file differs from a
normal image file in two ways. First, the filesystem
metadata is placed in the proper position so that e2fsck,
dumpe2fs, debugfs, etc. can be run directly on the raw image
file. In order to minimize the amount of disk space consumed
by a raw image file, the file is created as a sparse file.
(Beware of copying or compressing/decompressing this file
with utilities that don&rsquo;t understand how to create
sparse files; the file will become as large as the
filesystem itself!) Secondly, the raw image file also
includes indirect blocks and directory blocks, which the
standard image file does not have, although this may change
in the future.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Raw image files
are sometimes used when sending filesystems to the
maintainer as part of bug reports to e2fsprogs. When used in
this capacity, the recommended command is as follows
(replace hda1 with the appropriate device):</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="8%"></td>
<td width="7%"></td>
<td width="85%">


<p><b>e2image &minus;r /dev/hda1 &minus; | bzip2 &gt;
hda1.e2i.bz2</b></p> </td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This will only
send the metadata information, without any data blocks.
However, the filenames in the directory blocks can still
reveal information about the contents of the filesystem that
the bug reporter may wish to keep confidential. To address
this concern, the <b>&minus;s</b> option can be specified.
This will cause <b>e2image</b> to scramble directory entries
and zero out any unused portions of the directory blocks
before writing the image file. However, the <b>&minus;s</b>
option will prevent analysis of problems related to
hash-tree indexed directories.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that this
will work even if you substitute &quot;/dev/hda1&quot; for
another raw disk image, or QCOW2 image previously created by
<b>e2image</b>.</p>

<h2>QCOW2 IMAGE FILES
<a name="QCOW2 IMAGE FILES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>&minus;Q</b> option will create a QCOW2 image file
instead of a normal, or raw image file. A QCOW2 image
contains all the information the raw image does, however
unlike the raw image it is not sparse. The QCOW2 image
minimize the amount of disk space by storing data in special
format with pack data closely together, hence avoiding holes
while still minimizing size.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In order to
send filesystem to the maintainer as a part of bug report to
e2fsprogs, use following commands (replace hda1 with the
appropriate device):</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="8%"></td>
<td width="92%">


<p><b>e2image &minus;Q /dev/hda1 hda1.qcow2</b></p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="8%"></td>
<td width="92%">


<p><b>bzip2 -z hda1.qcow2</b></p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This will only
send the metadata information, without any data blocks.
However, the filenames in the directory blocks can still
reveal information about the contents of the filesystem that
the bug reporter may wish to keep confidential. To address
this concern, the <b>&minus;s</b> option can be specified.
This will cause <b>e2image</b> to scramble directory entries
and zero out any unused portions of the directory blocks
before writing the image file. However, the <b>&minus;s</b>
option will prevent analysis of problems related to
hash-tree indexed directories.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that QCOW2
image created by <b>e2image</b> is regular QCOW2 image and
can be processed by tools aware of QCOW2 format such as for
example <b>qemu-img</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can convert
a qcow2 image into a raw image with:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="8%"></td>
<td width="92%">


<p><b>e2image &minus;r hda1.qcow2 hda1.raw</b></p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This can be
useful to write a qcow2 image containing all data to a
sparse image file where it can be loop mounted, or to a disk
partition. Note that this may not work with qcow2 images not
generated by e2image.</p>

<h2>INCLUDING DATA
<a name="INCLUDING DATA"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Normally
<b>e2image</b> only includes fs metadata, not regular file
data. The <b>&minus;a</b> option can be specified to include
all data. This will give an image that is suitable to use to
clone the entire FS or for backup purposes. Note that this
option only works with the raw or QCOW2 formats. The
<b>&minus;p</b> switch may be given to show progress. If the
file system is being cloned to a flash-based storage device
(where reads are very fast and where it is desirable to
avoid unnecessary writes to reduce write wear on the
device), the <b>&minus;c</b> option which cause e2image to
try reading a block from the destination to see if it is
identical to the block which <b>e2image</b> is about to
copy. If the block is already the same, the write can be
skipped. The <b>&minus;n</b> option will cause all of the
writes to be no-ops, and print the blocks that would have
been written.</p>

<h2>OFFSETS
<a name="OFFSETS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Normally a
filesystem starts at the beginning of a partition, and
<b>e2image</b> is run on the partition. When working with
image files, you don&rsquo;t have the option of using the
partition device, so you can specify the offset where the
filesystem starts directly with the <b>&minus;o</b> option.
Similarly the <b>&minus;O</b> option specifies the offset
that should be seeked to in the destination before writing
the filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For example, if
you have a <b>dd</b> image of a whole hard drive that
contains an ext2 fs in a partition starting at 1 MiB, you
can clone that fs with:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="8%"></td>
<td width="92%">


<p><b>e2image &minus;aro 1048576 img /dev/sda1</b></p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Or you can
clone a fs into an image file, leaving room in the first MiB
for a partition table with:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="8%"></td>
<td width="92%">


<p><b>e2image -arO 1048576 /dev/sda1 img</b></p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you specify
at least one offset, and only one file, an in-place move
will be performed, allowing you to safely move the
filesystem from one offset to another.</p>
