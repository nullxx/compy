<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Updates files
in the working tree to match the version in the index or the
specified tree. If no paths are given, <i>git checkout</i>
will also update HEAD to set the specified branch as the
current branch.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>git
checkout</i> &lt;branch&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">To prepare for working on
&lt;branch&gt;, switch to it by updating the index and the
files in the working tree, and by pointing HEAD at the
branch. Local modifications to the files in the working tree
are kept, so that they can be committed to the
&lt;branch&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If
&lt;branch&gt; is not found but there does exist a tracking
branch in exactly one remote (call it &lt;remote&gt;) with a
matching name, treat as equivalent to</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">$ git checkout
&minus;b &lt;branch&gt; &minus;&minus;track
&lt;remote&gt;/&lt;branch&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">You could omit
&lt;branch&gt;, in which case the command degenerates to
&quot;check out the current branch&quot;, which is a
glorified no&minus;op with a rather expensive
side&minus;effects to show only the tracking information, if
exists, for the current branch.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>git
checkout</i> &minus;b|&minus;B &lt;new_branch&gt; [&lt;start
point&gt;]</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Specifying &minus;b causes a
new branch to be created as if <b>git-branch</b>(1) were
called and then checked out. In this case you can use the
&minus;&minus;track or &minus;&minus;no&minus;track options,
which will be passed to <i>git branch</i>. As a convenience,
&minus;&minus;track without &minus;b implies branch
creation; see the description of &minus;&minus;track
below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If &minus;B is
given, &lt;new_branch&gt; is created if it doesn&rsquo;t
exist; otherwise, it is reset. This is the transactional
equivalent of</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">$ git branch
&minus;f &lt;branch&gt; [&lt;start point&gt;] <br>
$ git checkout &lt;branch&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">that is to say,
the branch is not reset/created unless &quot;git
checkout&quot; is successful.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>git
checkout</i> &minus;&minus;detach [&lt;branch&gt;], <i>git
checkout</i> &lt;commit&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Prepare to work on top of
&lt;commit&gt;, by detaching HEAD at it (see &quot;DETACHED
HEAD&quot; section), and updating the index and the files in
the working tree. Local modifications to the files in the
working tree are kept, so that the resulting working tree
will be the state recorded in the commit plus the local
modifications.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Passing
&minus;&minus;detach forces this behavior in the case of a
&lt;branch&gt; (without the option, giving a branch name to
the command would check out the branch, instead of detaching
HEAD at it), or the current commit, if no &lt;branch&gt; is
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>git
checkout</i> [&minus;p|&minus;&minus;patch]
[&lt;tree&minus;ish&gt;] [&minus;&minus;]
&lt;pathspec&gt;...</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When &lt;paths&gt; or
&minus;&minus;patch are given, <i>git checkout</i> does
<b>not</b> switch branches. It updates the named paths in
the working tree from the index file or from a named
&lt;tree&minus;ish&gt; (most often a commit). In this case,
the &minus;b and &minus;&minus;track options are meaningless
and giving either of them results in an error. The
&lt;tree&minus;ish&gt; argument can be used to specify a
specific tree&minus;ish (i.e. commit, tag or tree) to update
the index for the given paths before updating the working
tree.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The index may
contain unmerged entries because of a previous failed merge.
By default, if you try to check out such an entry from the
index, the checkout operation will fail and nothing will be
checked out. Using &minus;f will ignore these unmerged
entries. The contents from a specific side of the merge can
be checked out of the index by using &minus;&minus;ours or
&minus;&minus;theirs. With &minus;m, changes made to the
working tree file can be discarded to re&minus;create the
original conflicted merge result.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;q,
&minus;&minus;quiet</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Quiet, suppress feedback
messages.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;f,
&minus;&minus;force</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When switching branches,
proceed even if the index or the working tree differs from
HEAD. This is used to throw away local changes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">When checking
out paths from the index, do not fail upon unmerged entries;
instead, unmerged entries are ignored.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;ours,
&minus;&minus;theirs</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When checking out paths from
the index, check out stage #2 (<i>ours</i>) or #3
(<i>theirs</i>) for unmerged paths.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;b
&lt;new_branch&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Create a new branch named
&lt;new_branch&gt; and start it at &lt;start_point&gt;; see
<b>git-branch</b>(1) for details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;B
&lt;new_branch&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Creates the branch
&lt;new_branch&gt; and start it at &lt;start_point&gt;; if
it already exists, then reset it to &lt;start_point&gt;.
This is equivalent to running &quot;git branch&quot; with
&quot;&minus;f&quot;; see <b>git-branch</b>(1) for
details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;t,
&minus;&minus;track</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When creating a new branch, set
up &quot;upstream&quot; configuration. See
&quot;&minus;&minus;track&quot; in <b>git-branch</b>(1) for
details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If no
<i>&minus;b</i> option is given, the name of the new branch
will be derived from the remote&minus;tracking branch. If
&quot;remotes/&quot; or &quot;refs/remotes/&quot; is
prefixed it is stripped away, and then the part up to the
next slash (which would be the nickname of the remote) is
removed. This would tell us to use &quot;hack&quot; as the
local branch when branching off of &quot;origin/hack&quot;
(or &quot;remotes/origin/hack&quot;, or even
&quot;refs/remotes/origin/hack&quot;). If the given name has
no slash, or the above guessing results in an empty name,
the guessing is aborted. You can explicitly give a name with
<i>&minus;b</i> in such a case.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;no&minus;track</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Do not set up
&quot;upstream&quot; configuration, even if the
branch.autosetupmerge configuration variable is true.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;l</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Create the new branch&rsquo;s
reflog; see <b>git-branch</b>(1) for details.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;detach</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Rather than checking out a
branch to work on it, check out a commit for inspection and
discardable experiments. This is the default behavior of
&quot;git checkout &lt;commit&gt;&quot; when &lt;commit&gt;
is not a branch name. See the &quot;DETACHED HEAD&quot;
section below for details.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;orphan
&lt;new_branch&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Create a new <i>orphan</i>
branch, named &lt;new_branch&gt;, started from
&lt;start_point&gt; and switch to it. The first commit made
on this new branch will have no parents and it will be the
root of a new history totally disconnected from all the
other branches and commits.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The index and
the working tree are adjusted as if you had previously run
&quot;git checkout &lt;start_point&gt;&quot;. This allows
you to start a new history that records a set of paths
similar to &lt;start_point&gt; by easily running &quot;git
commit &minus;a&quot; to make the root commit.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This can be
useful when you want to publish the tree from a commit
without exposing its full history. You might want to do this
to publish an open source branch of a project whose current
tree is &quot;clean&quot;, but whose full history contains
proprietary or otherwise encumbered bits of code.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If you want to
start a disconnected history that records a set of paths
that is totally different from the one of
&lt;start_point&gt;, then you should clear the index and the
working tree right after creating the orphan branch by
running &quot;git rm &minus;rf .&quot; from the top level of
the working tree. Afterwards you will be ready to prepare
your new files, repopulating the working tree, by copying
them from elsewhere, extracting a tarball, etc.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;ignore&minus;skip&minus;worktree&minus;bits</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">In sparse checkout mode, git
checkout &minus;&minus; &lt;paths&gt; would update only
entries matched by &lt;paths&gt; and sparse patterns in
$GIT_DIR/info/sparse&minus;checkout. This option ignores the
sparse patterns and adds back any files in
&lt;paths&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;m,
&minus;&minus;merge</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When switching branches, if you
have local modifications to one or more files that are
different between the current branch and the branch to which
you are switching, the command refuses to switch branches in
order to preserve your modifications in context. However,
with this option, a three&minus;way merge between the
current branch, your working tree contents, and the new
branch is done, and you will be on the new branch.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">When a merge
conflict happens, the index entries for conflicting paths
are left unmerged, and you need to resolve the conflicts and
mark the resolved paths with git add (or git rm if the merge
should result in deletion of the path).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">When checking
out paths from the index, this option lets you recreate the
conflicted merge in the specified paths.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;conflict=&lt;style&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The same as &minus;&minus;merge
option above, but changes the way the conflicting hunks are
presented, overriding the merge.conflictstyle configuration
variable. Possible values are &quot;merge&quot; (default)
and &quot;diff3&quot; (in addition to what is shown by
&quot;merge&quot; style, shows the original contents).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;p,
&minus;&minus;patch</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Interactively select hunks in
the difference between the &lt;tree&minus;ish&gt; (or the
index, if unspecified) and the working tree. The chosen
hunks are then applied in reverse to the working tree (and
if a &lt;tree&minus;ish&gt; was specified, the index).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This means that
you can use git checkout &minus;p to selectively discard
edits from your current working tree. See the
&ldquo;Interactive Mode&rdquo; section of <b>git-add</b>(1)
to learn how to operate the &minus;&minus;patch mode.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&lt;branch&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Branch to checkout; if it
refers to a branch (i.e., a name that, when prepended with
&quot;refs/heads/&quot;, is a valid ref), then that branch
is checked out. Otherwise, if it refers to a valid commit,
your HEAD becomes &quot;detached&quot; and you are no longer
on any branch (see below for details).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">As a special
case, the &quot;@{&minus;N}&quot; syntax for the N&minus;th
last branch checks out the branch (instead of detaching).
You may also specify &minus; which is synonymous with
&quot;@{&minus;1}&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">As a further
special case, you may use &quot;A...B&quot; as a shortcut
for the merge base of A and B if there is exactly one merge
base. You can leave out at most one of A and B, in which
case it defaults to HEAD.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&lt;new_branch&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Name for the new branch.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&lt;start_point&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The name of a commit at which
to start the new branch; see <b>git-branch</b>(1) for
details. Defaults to HEAD.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&lt;tree&minus;ish&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Tree to checkout from (when
paths are given). If not specified, the index will be
used.</p>

<h2>DETACHED HEAD
<a name="DETACHED HEAD"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">HEAD normally
refers to a named branch (e.g. <i>master</i>). Meanwhile,
each branch refers to a specific commit. Let&rsquo;s look at
a repo with three commits, one of them tagged, and with
branch <i>master</i> checked out:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">HEAD (refers to
branch 'master') <br>
| <br>
v <br>
a&minus;&minus;&minus;b&minus;&minus;&minus;c branch
'master' (refers to commit 'c') <br>
^ <br>
| <br>
tag 'v2.0' (refers to commit 'b')</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When a commit
is created in this state, the branch is updated to refer to
the new commit. Specifically, <i>git commit</i> creates a
new commit <i>d</i>, whose parent is commit <i>c</i>, and
then updates branch <i>master</i> to refer to new commit
<i>d</i>. HEAD still refers to branch <i>master</i> and so
indirectly now refers to commit <i>d</i>:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">$ edit; git
add; git commit</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">HEAD (refers to
branch 'master') <br>
| <br>
v <br>

a&minus;&minus;&minus;b&minus;&minus;&minus;c&minus;&minus;&minus;d
branch 'master' (refers to commit 'd') <br>
^ <br>
| <br>
tag 'v2.0' (refers to commit 'b')</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is sometimes
useful to be able to checkout a commit that is not at the
tip of any named branch, or even to create a new commit that
is not referenced by a named branch. Let&rsquo;s look at
what happens when we checkout commit <i>b</i> (here we show
two ways this may be done):</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">$ git checkout
v2.0 # or <br>
$ git checkout master^^</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">HEAD (refers to
commit 'b') <br>
| <br>
v <br>

a&minus;&minus;&minus;b&minus;&minus;&minus;c&minus;&minus;&minus;d
branch 'master' (refers to commit 'd') <br>
^ <br>
| <br>
tag 'v2.0' (refers to commit 'b')</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Notice that
regardless of which checkout command we use, HEAD now refers
directly to commit <i>b</i>. This is known as being in
detached HEAD state. It means simply that HEAD refers to a
specific commit, as opposed to referring to a named branch.
Let&rsquo;s see what happens when we create a commit:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">$ edit; git
add; git commit</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">HEAD (refers to
commit 'e') <br>
| <br>
v <br>
e <br>
/ <br>

a&minus;&minus;&minus;b&minus;&minus;&minus;c&minus;&minus;&minus;d
branch 'master' (refers to commit 'd') <br>
^ <br>
| <br>
tag 'v2.0' (refers to commit 'b')</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There is now a
new commit <i>e</i>, but it is referenced only by HEAD. We
can of course add yet another commit in this state:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">$ edit; git
add; git commit</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">HEAD (refers to
commit 'f') <br>
| <br>
v <br>
e&minus;&minus;&minus;f <br>
/ <br>

a&minus;&minus;&minus;b&minus;&minus;&minus;c&minus;&minus;&minus;d
branch 'master' (refers to commit 'd') <br>
^ <br>
| <br>
tag 'v2.0' (refers to commit 'b')</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In fact, we can
perform all the normal Git operations. But, let&rsquo;s look
at what happens when we then checkout master:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">$ git checkout
master</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">HEAD (refers to
branch 'master') <br>
e&minus;&minus;&minus;f | <br>
/ v <br>

a&minus;&minus;&minus;b&minus;&minus;&minus;c&minus;&minus;&minus;d
branch 'master' (refers to commit 'd') <br>
^ <br>
| <br>
tag 'v2.0' (refers to commit 'b')</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is important
to realize that at this point nothing refers to commit
<i>f</i>. Eventually commit <i>f</i> (and by extension
commit <i>e</i>) will be deleted by the routine Git garbage
collection process, unless we create a reference before that
happens. If we have not yet moved away from commit <i>f</i>,
any of these will create a reference to it:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">$ git checkout
&minus;b foo <b>(1)</b> <br>
$ git branch foo <b>(2)</b> <br>
$ git tag foo <b>(3)</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>1.</b>
creates a new branch <i>foo</i>, which refers to commit
<i>f</i>, and then updates HEAD to refer to branch
<i>foo</i>. In other words, we&rsquo;ll no longer be in
detached HEAD state after this command. <b><br>
2.</b> similarly creates a new branch <i>foo</i>, which
refers to commit <i>f</i>, but leaves HEAD detached. <b><br>
3.</b> creates a new tag <i>foo</i>, which refers to commit
<i>f</i>, leaving HEAD detached.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If we have
moved away from commit <i>f</i>, then we must first recover
its object name (typically by using git reflog), and then we
can create a reference to it. For example, to see the last
two commits to which HEAD referred, we can use either of
these commands:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">$ git reflog
&minus;2 HEAD # or <br>
$ git log &minus;g &minus;2 HEAD</p>

<h2>EXAMPLES
<a name="EXAMPLES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">1. The
following sequence checks out the master branch, reverts the
Makefile to two revisions back, deletes hello.c by mistake,
and gets it back from the index.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">$ git checkout
master <b>(1)</b> <br>
$ git checkout master~2 Makefile <b>(2)</b> <br>
$ rm &minus;f hello.c <br>
$ git checkout hello.c <b>(3)</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><b>1.</b>
switch branch <b><br>
2.</b> take a file out of another commit <b><br>
3.</b> restore hello.c from the index</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If you want to
check out <i>all</i> C source files out of the index, you
can say</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">$ git checkout
&minus;&minus; '*.c'</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note the quotes
around *.c. The file hello.c will also be checked out, even
though it is no longer in the working tree, because the file
globbing is used to match entries in the index (not in the
working tree by the shell).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If you have an
unfortunate branch that is named hello.c, this step would be
confused as an instruction to switch to that branch. You
should instead write:</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">$ git checkout
&minus;&minus; hello.c</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">2. After
working in the wrong branch, switching to the correct branch
would be done using:</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">$ git checkout
mytopic</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">However, your
&quot;wrong&quot; branch and correct &quot;mytopic&quot;
branch may differ in files that you have modified locally,
in which case the above checkout would fail like this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">$ git checkout
mytopic <br>
error: You have local changes to 'frotz'; not switching
branches.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">You can give
the &minus;m flag to the command, which would try a
three&minus;way merge:</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">$ git checkout
&minus;m mytopic <br>
Auto&minus;merging frotz</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">After this
three&minus;way merge, the local modifications are
<i>not</i> registered in your index file, so git diff would
show you what changes you made since the tip of the new
branch.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">3. When a merge
conflict happens during switching branches with the &minus;m
option, you would see something like this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">$ git checkout
&minus;m mytopic <br>
Auto&minus;merging frotz <br>
ERROR: Merge conflict in frotz <br>
fatal: merge program failed</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">At this point,
git diff shows the changes cleanly merged as in the previous
example, as well as the changes in the conflicted files.
Edit and resolve the conflict and mark it resolved with git
add as usual:</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">$ edit frotz
<br>
$ git add frotz</p>

<h2>GIT
