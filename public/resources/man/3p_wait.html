</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>wait</i>() and <i>waitpid</i>() functions shall obtain
status information pertaining to one of the caller&rsquo;s
child processes. Various options permit status information
to be obtained for child processes that have terminated or
stopped. If status information is available for two or more
child processes, the order in which their status is reported
is unspecified.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>wait</i>() function shall suspend execution of the
calling thread until status information for one of the
terminated child processes of the calling process is
available, or until delivery of a signal whose action is
either to execute a signal-catching function or to terminate
the process. If more than one thread is suspended in
<i>wait</i>() or <i>waitpid</i>() awaiting termination of
the same process, exactly one thread shall return the
process status at the time of the target process
termination. If status information is available prior to the
call to <i>wait</i>(), return shall be immediate.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>waitpid</i>() function shall be equivalent to
<i>wait</i>() if the <i>pid</i> argument is (<b>pid_t</b>)-1
and the <i>options</i> argument is 0. Otherwise, its
behavior shall be modified by the values of the <i>pid</i>
and <i>options</i> arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The <i>pid</i>
argument specifies a set of child processes for which
<i>status</i> is requested. The <i>waitpid</i>() function
shall only return the status of a child process from this
set:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The status of any child

<h2>RATIONALE
<a name="RATIONALE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A call to the
<i>wait</i>() or <i>waitpid</i>() function only returns
<i>status</i> on an immediate child process of the calling
process; that is, a child that was produced by a single
<i>fork</i>() call (perhaps followed by an <i>exec</i> or
other function calls) from the parent. If a child produces
grandchildren by further use of <i>fork</i>(), none of those
grandchildren nor any of their descendants affect the
behavior of a <i>wait</i>() from the original parent
process. Nothing in this volume of
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 prevents an implementation
from providing extensions that permit a process to get
<i>status</i> from a grandchild or any other process, but a
process that does not use such extensions must be guaranteed
to see <i>status</i> from only its direct children.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>waitpid</i>() function is provided for three reasons:</p>

<td width="83%">


<p>To permit a library routine, such as <i>system</i>() or
<i>pclose</i>(), to wait for its children without
interfering with other terminated children for which the
process has not waited</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The first two
of these facilities are based on the <i>wait3</i>() function
provided by 4.3 BSD. The function uses the <i>options</i>
argument, which is equivalent to an argument to
<i>wait3</i>(). The WUNTRACED flag is used only in
conjunction with job control on systems supporting job
control. Its name comes from 4.3 BSD and refers to the fact
that there are two types of stopped processes in that
implementation: processes being traced via the
<i>ptrace</i>() debugging facility and (untraced) processes
stopped by job control signals. Since <i>ptrace</i>() is not
part of this volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001, only
the second type is relevant. The name WUNTRACED was retained
because its usage is the same, even though the name is not
intuitively meaningful in this context.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The third
reason for the <i>waitpid</i>() function is to permit
independent sections of a process to spawn and wait for
children without interfering with each other. For example,
the following problem occurs in developing a portable shell,
or command interpreter:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>stream =
popen(&quot;/bin/true&quot;); <br>
(void) system(&quot;sleep 100&quot;); <br>
(void) pclose(stream);</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On all
historical implementations, the final <i>pclose</i>() fails
to reap the <i>wait</i>() <i>status</i> of the
<i>popen</i>().</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The status
values are retrieved by macros, rather than given as
specific bit encodings as they are in most historical
implementations (and thus expected by existing programs).
This was necessary to eliminate a limitation on the number
of signals an implementation can support that was inherent
in the traditional encodings. This volume of
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 does require that a
<i>status</i> value of zero corresponds to a process calling
<i>_exit</i>(0), as this is the most common encoding
expected by existing programs. Some of the macro names were
adopted from 4.3 BSD.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These macros
syntactically operate on an arbitrary integer value. The
behavior is undefined unless that value is one stored by a
successful call to <i>wait</i>() or <i>waitpid</i>() in the
location pointed to by the <i>stat_loc</i> argument. An
early proposal attempted to make this clearer by specifying
each argument as *<i>stat_loc</i> rather than
<i>stat_val</i>. However, that did not follow the
conventions of other specifications in this volume of
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 or traditional usage. It also
could have implied that the argument to the macro must
literally be *<i>stat_loc</i>; in fact, that value can be
stored or passed as an argument to other functions before
being interpreted by these macros.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The extension
that affects <i>wait</i>() and <i>waitpid</i>() and is
common in historical implementations is the <i>ptrace</i>()
function. It is called by a child process and causes that
child to stop and return a <i>status</i> that appears
identical to the <i>status</i> indicated by WIFSTOPPED. The
<i>status</i> of <i>ptrace</i>() children is traditionally
returned regardless of the WUNTRACED flag (or by the
<i>wait</i>() function). Most applications do not need to
concern themselves with such extensions because they have
control over what extensions they or their children use.
However, applications, such as command interpreters, that
invoke arbitrary processes may see this behavior when those
arbitrary processes misuse such extensions.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Implementations
that support <b>core</b> file creation or other
implementation-defined actions on termination of some
processes traditionally provide a bit in the <i>status</i>
returned by <i>wait</i>() to indicate that such actions have
occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Allowing the
<i>wait</i>() family of functions to discard a pending
SIGCHLD signal that is associated with a successfully
waited-for child process puts them into the <i>sigwait</i>()
and <i>sigwaitinfo</i>() category with respect to
SIGCHLD.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This definition
allows implementations to treat a pending SIGCHLD signal as
accepted by the process in <i>wait</i>(), with the same
meaning of &quot;accepted&quot; as when that word is applied
to the <i>sigwait</i>() family of functions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Allowing the
<i>wait</i>() family of functions to behave this way permits
an implementation to be able to deal precisely with SIGCHLD
signals.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In particular,
an implementation that does accept (discard) the SIGCHLD
signal can make the following guarantees regardless of the
queuing depth of signals in general (the list of waitable
children can hold the SIGCHLD queue):</p>

process&rsquo; SIGCHLD handler to be called as a result of
the <i>fork</i>()/ <i>exec</i> executed within
<i>system</i>() because <i>system</i>() will accept the
SIGCHLD signal when it performs a <i>waitpid</i>() for its
child process. This is a desirable behavior of
<i>system</i>() so that it can be used in a library without
causing side effects to the application linked with the
library.</p> </td></tr>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">An
implementation that does not permit the <i>wait</i>() family
of functions to accept (discard) a pending SIGCHLD signal
associated with a successfully waited-for child, cannot make
the guarantees described above for the following reasons:
<br>
Guarantee #1</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Although it
might be assumed that reliable queuing of all SIGCHLD
signals generated by the system can make this guarantee, the
counter-example is the case of a process that blocks SIGCHLD
and performs an indefinite loop of <i>fork</i>()/
<i>wait</i>() operations. If the implementation supports
queued signals, then eventually the system will run out of
memory for the queue. The guarantee cannot be made because
there must be some limit to the depth of queuing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Guarantees #2 and #3</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">These cannot be
guaranteed unless the <i>wait</i>() family of functions
accepts the SIGCHLD signal. Otherwise, a <i>fork</i>()/
<i>wait</i>() executed while SIGCHLD is blocked (as in the
<i>system</i>() function) will result in an invocation of
the handler when SIGCHLD is unblocked, after the process has
disappeared.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Guarantee #4</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Although
possible to make this guarantee, <i>system</i>() would have
to set the SIGCHLD handler to SIG_DFL so that the SIGCHLD
signal generated by its <i>fork</i>() would be discarded
(the SIGCHLD default action is to be ignored), then restore
it to its previous setting. This would have the undesirable
side effect of discarding all SIGCHLD signals pending to the
process.</p>
