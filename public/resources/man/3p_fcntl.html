<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>fcntl</i>() function shall perform the operations
described below on open files. The <i>fildes</i> argument is
a file descriptor.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The available
values for <i>cmd</i> are defined in <i>&lt;fcntl.h&gt;</i>
and are as follows: <br>
F_DUPFD</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Return a new file descriptor
which shall be the lowest numbered available (that is, not
already open) file descriptor greater than or equal to the
third argument, <i>arg</i>, taken as an integer of type
<b>int</b>. The new file descriptor shall refer to the same
open file description as the original file descriptor, and
shall share any locks. The FD_CLOEXEC flag associated with
the new file descriptor shall be cleared to keep the file
open across calls to one of the <i>exec</i> functions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">F_GETFD</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Get the file descriptor flags
defined in <i>&lt;fcntl.h&gt;</i> that are associated with
the file descriptor <i>fildes</i>. File descriptor flags are
associated with a single file descriptor and do not affect
other file descriptors that refer to the same file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">F_SETFD</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set the file descriptor flags
defined in <i>&lt;fcntl.h&gt;</i>, that are associated with
<i>fildes</i>, to the third argument, <i>arg</i>, taken as
type <b>int</b>. If the FD_CLOEXEC flag in the third
argument is 0, the file shall remain open across the
<i>exec</i> functions; otherwise, the file shall be closed
upon successful execution of one of the <i>exec</i>
functions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">F_GETFL</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Get the file status flags and
file access modes, defined in <i>&lt;fcntl.h&gt;</i>, for
the file description associated with <i>fildes</i>. The file
access modes can be extracted from the return value using
the mask O_ACCMODE, which is defined in
<i>&lt;fcntl.h&gt;</i>. File status flags and file access
modes are associated with the file description and do not
affect other file descriptors that refer to the same file
with different open file descriptions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">F_SETFL</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set the file status flags,
defined in <i>&lt;fcntl.h&gt;</i>, for the file description
associated with <i>fildes</i> from the corresponding bits in
the third argument, <i>arg</i>, taken as type <b>int</b>.
Bits corresponding to the file access mode and the file
creation flags, as defined in <i>&lt;fcntl.h&gt;</i>, that
are set in <i>arg</i> shall be ignored. If any bits in
<i>arg</i> other than those mentioned here are changed by
the application, the result is unspecified.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">F_GETOWN</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If <i>fildes</i> refers to a
socket, get the process or process group ID specified to
receive SIGURG signals when out-of-band data is available.
Positive values indicate a process ID; negative values,
other than -1, indicate a process group ID. If <i>fildes</i>
does not refer to a socket, the results are unspecified.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">F_SETOWN</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If <i>fildes</i> refers to a
socket, set the process or process group ID specified to
receive SIGURG signals when out-of-band data is available,
using the value of the third argument, <i>arg</i>, taken as
type <b>int</b>. Positive values indicate a process ID;
negative values, other than -1, indicate a process group ID.
If <i>fildes</i> does not refer to a socket, the results are
unspecified.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
values for <i>cmd</i> are available for advisory record
locking. Record locking shall be supported for regular
files, and may be supported for other files. <br>
F_GETLK</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Get the first lock which blocks
the lock description pointed to by the third argument,
<i>arg</i>, taken as a pointer to type <b>struct flock</b>,
defined in <i>&lt;fcntl.h&gt;</i>. The information retrieved
shall overwrite the information passed to <i>fcntl</i>() in
the structure <b>flock</b>. If no lock is found that would
prevent this lock from being created, then the structure
shall be left unchanged except for the lock type which shall
be set to F_UNLCK.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">F_SETLK</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set or clear a file segment
lock according to the lock description pointed to by the
third argument, <i>arg</i>, taken as a pointer to type
<b>struct flock</b>, defined in <i>&lt;fcntl.h&gt;</i>.
F_SETLK can establish shared (or read) locks (F_RDLCK) or
exclusive (or write) locks (F_WRLCK), as well as to remove
either type of lock (F_UNLCK). F_RDLCK, F_WRLCK, and F_UNLCK
are defined in <i>&lt;fcntl.h&gt;</i>. If a shared or
exclusive lock cannot be set, <i>fcntl</i>() shall return
immediately with a return value of -1.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">F_SETLKW</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This command shall be
equivalent to F_SETLK except that if a shared or exclusive
lock is blocked by other locks, the thread shall wait until
the request can be satisfied. If a signal that is to be
caught is received while <i>fcntl</i>() is waiting for a
region, <i>fcntl</i>() shall be interrupted. Upon return
from the signal handler, <i>fcntl</i>() shall return -1 with
<i>errno</i> set to [EINTR], and the lock operation shall
not be done.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Additional
implementation-defined values for <i>cmd</i> may be defined
in <i>&lt;fcntl.h&gt;</i>. Their names shall start with
F_.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When a shared
lock is set on a segment of a file, other processes shall be
able to set shared locks on that segment or a portion of it.
A shared lock prevents any other process from setting an
exclusive lock on any portion of the protected area. A
request for a shared lock shall fail if the file descriptor
was not opened with read access.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">An exclusive
lock shall prevent any other process from setting a shared
lock or an exclusive lock on any portion of the protected
area. A request for an exclusive lock shall fail if the file
descriptor was not opened with write access.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The structure
<b>flock</b> describes the type ( <i>l_type</i>), starting
offset ( <i>l_whence</i>), relative offset (
<i>l_start</i>), size ( <i>l_len</i>), and process ID (
<i>l_pid</i>) of the segment of the file to be affected.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The value of
<i>l_whence</i> is SEEK_SET, SEEK_CUR, or SEEK_END, to
indicate that the relative offset <i>l_start</i> bytes shall
be measured from the start of the file, current position, or
end of the file, respectively. The value of <i>l_len</i> is
the number of consecutive bytes to be locked. The value of
<i>l_len</i> may be negative (where the definition of
<b>off_t</b> permits negative values of <i>l_len</i>). The
<i>l_pid</i> field is only used with F_GETLK to return the
process ID of the process holding a blocking lock. After a
successful F_GETLK request, when a blocking lock is found,
the values returned in the <b>flock</b> structure shall be
as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>l_start</i></p>

<p><i>l_pid</i></p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>Process ID of the process that holds the blocking
lock.</p> </td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the command
is F_SETLKW and the process must wait for another process to
release a lock, then the range of bytes to be locked shall
be determined before the <i>fcntl</i>() function blocks. If
the file size or file descriptor seek offset change while
<i>fcntl</i>() is blocked, this shall not affect the range
of bytes locked.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If <i>l_len</i>
is positive, the area affected shall start at <i>l_start</i>
and end at <i>l_start</i>+ <i>l_len</i>-1. If <i>l_len</i>
is negative, the area affected shall start at
<i>l_start</i>+ <i>l_len</i> and end at <i>l_start</i>-1.
Locks may start and extend beyond the current end of a file,
but shall not extend before the beginning of the file. A
lock shall be set to extend to the largest possible value of
the file offset for that file by setting <i>l_len</i> to 0.
If such a lock also has <i>l_start</i> set to 0 and
<i>l_whence</i> is set to SEEK_SET, the whole file shall be
locked.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There shall be
at most one type of lock set for each byte in the file.
Before a successful return from an F_SETLK or an F_SETLKW
request when the calling process has previously existing
locks on bytes in the region specified by the request, the
previous lock type for each byte in the specified region
shall be replaced by the new lock type. As specified above
under the descriptions of shared locks and exclusive locks,
an F_SETLK or an F_SETLKW request (respectively) shall fail
or block when another process has existing locks on bytes in
the specified region and the type of any of those locks
conflicts with the type specified in the request.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">All locks
associated with a file for a given process shall be removed
when a file descriptor for that file is closed by that
process or the process holding that file descriptor
terminates. Locks are not inherited by a child process.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A potential for
deadlock occurs if a process controlling a locked region is
put to sleep by attempting to lock another process&rsquo;
locked region. If the system detects that sleeping until a
locked region is unlocked would cause a deadlock,
<i>fcntl</i>() shall fail with an [EDEADLK] error.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">An unlock
(F_UNLCK) request in which <i>l_len</i> is non-zero and the
offset of the last byte of the requested segment is the
maximum value for an object of type <b>off_t</b>, when the
process has an existing lock in which <i>l_len</i> is 0 and
which includes the last byte of the requested segment, shall
be treated as a request to unlock from the start of the
requested segment with an <i>l_len</i> equal to 0.
Otherwise, an unlock (F_UNLCK) request shall attempt to
unlock only the requested segment.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When the file
descriptor <i>fildes</i> refers to a shared memory object,
the behavior of <i>fcntl</i>() shall be the same as for a
regular file except the effect of the following values for
the argument <i>cmd</i> shall be unspecified: F_SETFL,
F_GETLK, F_SETLK, and F_SETLKW.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If
<i>fildes</i> refers to a typed memory object, the result of
the <i>fcntl</i>() function is unspecified.</p>

<h2>RETURN VALUE

<h2>RATIONALE
<a name="RATIONALE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The ellipsis in
the SYNOPSIS is the syntax specified by the ISO&nbsp;C
standard for a variable number of arguments. It is used
because System V uses pointers for the implementation of
file locking functions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The <i>arg</i>
values to F_GETFD, F_SETFD, F_GETFL, and F_SETFL all
represent flag values to allow for future growth.
Applications using these functions should do a
read-modify-write operation on them, rather than assuming
that only the values defined by this volume of
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 are valid. It is a common
error to forget this, particularly in the case of
F_SETFD.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This volume of
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 permits concurrent read and
write access to file data using the <i>fcntl</i>() function;
this is a change from the 1984 /usr/group standard and early
proposals. Without concurrency controls, this feature may
not be fully utilized without occasional loss of data.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Data losses
occur in several ways. One case occurs when several
processes try to update the same record, without sequencing
controls; several updates may occur in parallel and the last
writer &quot;wins&quot;. Another case is a bit-tree or other
internal list-based database that is undergoing
reorganization. Without exclusive use to the tree segment by
the updating process, other reading processes chance getting
lost in the database when the index blocks are split,
condensed, inserted, or deleted. While <i>fcntl</i>() is
useful for many applications, it is not intended to be
overly general and does not handle the bit-tree example
well.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This facility
is only required for regular files because it is not
appropriate for many devices such as terminals and network
connections.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Since
<i>fcntl</i>() works with &quot;any file descriptor
associated with that file, however it is obtained&quot;, the
file descriptor may have been inherited through a
<i>fork</i>() or <i>exec</i> operation and thus may affect a
file that another process also has open.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The use of the
open file description to identify what to lock requires
extra calls and presents problems if several processes are
sharing an open file description, but there are too many
implementations of the existing mechanism for this volume of
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 to use different
specifications.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Another
consequence of this model is that closing any file
descriptor for a given file (whether or not it is the same
open file description that created the lock) causes the
locks on that file to be relinquished for that process.
Equivalently, any close for any file/process pair
relinquishes the locks owned on that file for that process.
But note that while an open file description may be shared
through <i>fork</i>(), locks are not inherited through
<i>fork</i>(). Yet locks may be inherited through one of the
<i>exec</i> functions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
identification of a machine in a network environment is
outside the scope of this volume of
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001. Thus, an <i>l_sysid</i>
member, such as found in System V, is not included in the
locking structure.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Changing of
lock types can result in a previously locked region being
split into smaller regions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Mandatory
locking was a major feature of the 1984 /usr/group
standard.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For advisory
file record locking to be effective, all processes that have
access to a file must cooperate and use the advisory
mechanism before doing I/O on the file. Enforcement-mode
record locking is important when it cannot be assumed that
all processes are cooperating. For example, if one user uses
an editor to update a file at the same time that a second
user executes another process that updates the same file and
if only one of the two processes is using advisory locking,
the processes are not cooperating. Enforcement-mode record
locking would protect against accidental collisions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Secondly,
advisory record locking requires a process using locking to
bracket each I/O operation with lock (or test) and unlock
operations. With enforcement-mode file and record locking, a
process can lock the file once and unlock when all I/O
operations have been completed. Enforcement-mode record
locking provides a base that can be enhanced; for example,
with sharable locks. That is, the mechanism could be
enhanced to allow a process to lock a file so other
processes could read it, but none of them could write
it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Mandatory locks
