<h2>PCRE JUST-IN-TIME COMPILER SUPPORT
<a name="PCRE JUST-IN-TIME COMPILER SUPPORT"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Just-in-time
compiling is a heavyweight optimization that can greatly
speed up pattern matching. However, it comes at the cost of
extra processing before the match is performed. Therefore,
it is of most benefit when the same pattern is going to be
matched many times. This does not necessarily mean many
calls of a matching function; if the pattern is not
anchored, matching attempts may take place many times at
various positions in the subject, even for a single call.
Therefore, if the subject string is very long, it may still
pay to use JIT for one-off matches.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">JIT support
applies only to the traditional Perl-compatible matching
function. It does not apply when the DFA matching function
is being used. The code for this support was written by
Zoltan Herczeg.</p>

<h2>8-BIT, 16-BIT AND 32-BIT SUPPORT
<a name="8-BIT, 16-BIT AND 32-BIT SUPPORT"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">JIT support is
available for all of the 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit PCRE
libraries. To keep this documentation simple, only the 8-bit
interface is described in what follows. If you are using the
16-bit library, substitute the 16-bit functions and 16-bit
structures (for example, <i>pcre16_jit_stack</i> instead of
<i>pcre_jit_stack</i>). If you are using the 32-bit library,
substitute the 32-bit functions and 32-bit structures (for
example, <i>pcre32_jit_stack</i> instead of
<i>pcre_jit_stack</i>).</p>

<h2>AVAILABILITY OF JIT SUPPORT
<a name="AVAILABILITY OF JIT SUPPORT"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">JIT support is
an optional feature of PCRE. The &quot;configure&quot;
option --enable-jit (or equivalent CMake option) must be set
when PCRE is built if you want to use JIT. The support is
limited to the following hardware platforms:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">ARM v5, v7, and
Thumb2 <br>
Intel x86 32-bit and 64-bit <br>
MIPS 32-bit <br>
Power PC 32-bit and 64-bit <br>
SPARC 32-bit (experimental)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If --enable-jit
is set on an unsupported platform, compilation fails.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A program that
is linked with PCRE 8.20 or later can tell if JIT support is
available by calling <b>pcre_config()</b> with the
PCRE_CONFIG_JIT option. The result is 1 when JIT is
available, and 0 otherwise. However, a simple program does
not need to check this in order to use JIT. The normal API
is implemented in a way that falls back to the interpretive
code if JIT is not available. For programs that need the
best possible performance, there is also a &quot;fast
path&quot; API that is JIT-specific.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If your program
may sometimes be linked with versions of PCRE that are older
than 8.20, but you want to use JIT when it is available, you
can test the values of PCRE_MAJOR and PCRE_MINOR, or the
existence of a JIT macro such as PCRE_CONFIG_JIT, for
compile-time control of your code.</p>

<h2>SIMPLE USE OF JIT
<a name="SIMPLE USE OF JIT"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You have to do
two things to make use of the JIT support in the simplest
way:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">(1) Call
<b>pcre_study()</b> with the PCRE_STUDY_JIT_COMPILE option
for <br>
each compiled pattern, and pass the resulting
<b>pcre_extra</b> block to <b><br>
pcre_exec()</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">(2) Use
<b>pcre_free_study()</b> to free the <b>pcre_extra</b> block
when it is <br>
no longer needed, instead of just freeing it yourself. This
ensures that <br>
any JIT data is also freed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For a program
that may be linked with pre-8.20 versions of PCRE, you can
insert</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">#ifndef
PCRE_STUDY_JIT_COMPILE <br>
#define PCRE_STUDY_JIT_COMPILE 0 <br>
#endif</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">so that no
option is passed to <b>pcre_study()</b>, and then use
something like this to free the study data:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">#ifdef
PCRE_CONFIG_JIT <br>
pcre_free_study(study_ptr); <br>
#else <br>
pcre_free(study_ptr); <br>
#endif</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">PCRE_STUDY_JIT_COMPILE
requests the JIT compiler to generate code for complete
matches. If you want to run partial matches using the
PCRE_PARTIAL_HARD or PCRE_PARTIAL_SOFT options of
<b>pcre_exec()</b>, you should set one or both of the
following options in addition to, or instead of,
PCRE_STUDY_JIT_COMPILE when you call
<b>pcre_study()</b>:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">PCRE_STUDY_JIT_PARTIAL_HARD_COMPILE
<br>
PCRE_STUDY_JIT_PARTIAL_SOFT_COMPILE</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The JIT
compiler generates different optimized code for each of the
three modes (normal, soft partial, hard partial). When
<b>pcre_exec()</b> is called, the appropriate code is run if
it is available. Otherwise, the pattern is matched using
interpretive code.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In some
circumstances you may need to call additional functions.
These are described in the section entitled
&quot;Controlling the JIT stack&quot; below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If JIT support
is not available, PCRE_STUDY_JIT_COMPILE etc. are ignored,
and no JIT data is created. Otherwise, the compiled pattern
is passed to the JIT compiler, which turns it into machine
code that executes much faster than the normal interpretive
code. When <b>pcre_exec()</b> is passed a <b>pcre_extra</b>
block containing a pointer to JIT code of the appropriate
mode (normal or hard/soft partial), it obeys that code
instead of running the interpreter. The result is identical,
but the compiled JIT code runs much faster.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There are some
<b>pcre_exec()</b> options that are not supported for JIT
execution. There are also some pattern items that JIT cannot
handle. Details are given below. In both cases, execution
automatically falls back to the interpretive code. If you
want to know whether JIT was actually used for a particular
match, you should arrange for a JIT callback function to be
set up as described in the section entitled
&quot;Controlling the JIT stack&quot; below, even if you do
not need to supply a non-default JIT stack. Such a callback
function is called whenever JIT code is about to be obeyed.
If the execution options are not right for JIT execution,
the callback function is not obeyed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the JIT
compiler finds an unsupported item, no JIT data is
generated. You can find out if JIT execution is available
after studying a pattern by calling <b>pcre_fullinfo()</b>
with the PCRE_INFO_JIT option. A result of 1 means that JIT
compilation was successful. A result of 0 means that JIT
support is not available, or the pattern was not studied
with PCRE_STUDY_JIT_COMPILE etc., or the JIT compiler was
not able to handle the pattern.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Once a pattern
has been studied, with or without JIT, it can be used as
many times as you like for matching different subject
strings.</p>

<h2>UNSUPPORTED OPTIONS AND PATTERN ITEMS
<a name="UNSUPPORTED OPTIONS AND PATTERN ITEMS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The only
<b>pcre_exec()</b> options that are supported for JIT
execution are PCRE_NO_UTF8_CHECK, PCRE_NO_UTF16_CHECK,
PCRE_NO_UTF32_CHECK, PCRE_NOTBOL, PCRE_NOTEOL,
PCRE_NOTEMPTY, PCRE_NOTEMPTY_ATSTART, PCRE_PARTIAL_HARD, and
PCRE_PARTIAL_SOFT.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The unsupported
pattern items are:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">\C match a
single byte; not supported in UTF-8 mode <br>
(?Cn) callouts <br>
(*PRUNE) ) <br>
(*SKIP) ) backtracking control verbs <br>
(*THEN) )</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Support for
some of these may be added in future.</p>

<h2>RETURN VALUES FROM JIT EXECUTION
<a name="RETURN VALUES FROM JIT EXECUTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When a pattern
is matched using JIT execution, the return values are the
same as those given by the interpretive <b>pcre_exec()</b>
code, with the addition of one new error code:
PCRE_ERROR_JIT_STACKLIMIT. This means that the memory used
for the JIT stack was insufficient. See &quot;Controlling
the JIT stack&quot; below for a discussion of JIT stack
usage. For compatibility with the interpretive
<b>pcre_exec()</b> code, no more than two-thirds of the
<i>ovector</i> argument is used for passing back captured
substrings.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The error code
PCRE_ERROR_MATCHLIMIT is returned by the JIT code if
searching a very large pattern tree goes on for too long, as
it is in the same circumstance when JIT is not used, but the
details of exactly what is counted are not the same. The
PCRE_ERROR_RECURSIONLIMIT error code is never returned by
JIT execution.</p>

<h2>SAVING AND RESTORING COMPILED PATTERNS
<a name="SAVING AND RESTORING COMPILED PATTERNS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The code that
is generated by the JIT compiler is architecture-specific,
and is also position dependent. For those reasons it cannot
be saved (in a file or database) and restored later like the
bytecode and other data of a compiled pattern. Saving and
restoring compiled patterns is not something many people do.
More detail about this facility is given in the
<b>pcreprecompile</b> documentation. It should be possible
to run <b>pcre_study()</b> on a saved and restored pattern,
and thereby recreate the JIT data, but because JIT
compilation uses significant resources, it is probably not
worth doing this; you might as well recompile the original
pattern.</p>

<h2>CONTROLLING THE JIT STACK
<a name="CONTROLLING THE JIT STACK"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When the
compiled JIT code runs, it needs a block of memory to use as
a stack. By default, it uses 32K on the machine stack.
However, some large or complicated patterns need more than
this. The error PCRE_ERROR_JIT_STACKLIMIT is given when
there is not enough stack. Three functions are provided for
managing blocks of memory for use as JIT stacks. There is
further discussion about the use of JIT stacks in the
section entitled &quot;JIT stack FAQ&quot; below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>pcre_jit_stack_alloc()</b> function creates a JIT stack.
Its arguments are a starting size and a maximum size, and it
returns a pointer to an opaque structure of type
<b>pcre_jit_stack</b>, or NULL if there is an error. The
<b>pcre_jit_stack_free()</b> function can be used to free a
stack that is no longer needed. (For the technically minded:
the address space is allocated by mmap or VirtualAlloc.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">JIT uses far
less memory for recursion than the interpretive code, and a
maximum stack size of 512K to 1M should be more than enough
for any pattern.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>pcre_assign_jit_stack()</b> function specifies which
stack JIT code should use. Its arguments are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">pcre_extra
*extra <br>
pcre_jit_callback callback <br>
void *data</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>extra</i> argument must be the result of studying a
pattern with PCRE_STUDY_JIT_COMPILE etc. There are three
cases for the values of the other two options:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">(1) If
<i>callback</i> is NULL and <i>data</i> is NULL, an internal
32K block <br>
on the machine stack is used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">(2) If
<i>callback</i> is NULL and <i>data</i> is not NULL,
<i>data</i> must be <br>
a valid JIT stack, the result of calling
<b>pcre_jit_stack_alloc()</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">(3) If
<i>callback</i> is not NULL, it must point to a function
that is <br>
called with <i>data</i> as an argument at the start of
matching, in <br>
order to set up a JIT stack. If the return from the callback
<br>
function is NULL, the internal 32K stack is used; otherwise
the <br>
return value must be a valid JIT stack, the result of
calling <b><br>
pcre_jit_stack_alloc()</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A callback
function is obeyed whenever JIT code is about to be run; it
is not obeyed when <b>pcre_exec()</b> is called with options
that are incompatible for JIT execution. A callback function
can therefore be used to determine whether a match operation
was executed by JIT or by the interpreter.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You may safely
use the same JIT stack for more than one pattern (either by
assigning directly or by callback), as long as the patterns
are all matched sequentially in the same thread. In a
multithread application, if you do not specify a JIT stack,
or if you assign or pass back NULL from a callback, that is
thread-safe, because each thread has its own machine stack.
However, if you assign or pass back a non-NULL JIT stack,
this must be a different stack for each thread so that the
application is thread-safe.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Strictly
speaking, even more is allowed. You can assign the same
non-NULL stack to any number of patterns as long as they are
not used for matching by multiple threads at the same time.
For example, you can assign the same stack to all compiled
patterns, and use a global mutex in the callback to wait
until the stack is available for use. However, this is an
inefficient solution, and not recommended.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This is a
suggestion for how a multithreaded program that needs to set
up non-default JIT stacks might operate:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">During thread
initalization <br>
thread_local_var = pcre_jit_stack_alloc(...)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">During thread
exit <br>
pcre_jit_stack_free(thread_local_var)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Use a one-line
callback function <br>
return thread_local_var</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">All the
functions described in this section do nothing if JIT is not
available, and <b>pcre_assign_jit_stack()</b> does nothing
unless the <b>extra</b> argument is non-NULL and points to a
<b>pcre_extra</b> block that is the result of a successful
study with PCRE_STUDY_JIT_COMPILE etc.</p>

<h2>JIT STACK FAQ
<a name="JIT STACK FAQ"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">(1) Why do we
need JIT stacks?</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">PCRE (and JIT)
is a recursive, depth-first engine, so it needs a stack
where the local data of the current node is pushed before
checking its child nodes. Allocating real machine stack on
some platforms is difficult. For example, the stack chain
needs to be updated every time if we extend the stack on
PowerPC. Although it is possible, its updating time overhead
decreases performance. So we do the recursion in memory.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">(2) Why
don&rsquo;t we simply allocate blocks of memory with
<b>malloc()</b>?</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Modern
operating systems have a nice feature: they can reserve an
address space instead of allocating memory. We can safely
allocate memory pages inside this address space, so the
stack could grow without moving memory data (this is
important because of pointers). Thus we can allocate 1M
address space, and use only a single memory page (usually
4K) if that is enough. However, we can still grow up to 1M
anytime if needed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">(3) Who
&quot;owns&quot; a JIT stack?</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The owner of
the stack is the user program, not the JIT studied pattern
or anything else. The user program must ensure that if a
stack is used by <b>pcre_exec()</b>, (that is, it is
assigned to the pattern currently running), that stack must
not be used by any other threads (to avoid overwriting the
same memory area). The best practice for multithreaded
programs is to allocate a stack for each thread, and return
this stack through the JIT callback function.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">(4) When should
a JIT stack be freed?</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can free a
JIT stack at any time, as long as it will not be used by
<b>pcre_exec()</b> again. When you assign the stack to a
pattern, only a pointer is set. There is no reference
counting or any other magic. You can free the patterns and
stacks in any order, anytime. Just <i>do not</i> call
<b>pcre_exec()</b> with a pattern pointing to an already
freed stack, as that will cause SEGFAULT. (Also, do not free
a stack currently used by <b>pcre_exec()</b> in another
thread). You can also replace the stack for a pattern at any
time. You can even free the previous stack before assigning
a replacement.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">(5) Should I
allocate/free a stack every time before/after calling
<b>pcre_exec()</b>?</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">No, because
this is too costly in terms of resources. However, you could
implement some clever idea which release the stack if it is
not used in let&rsquo;s say two minutes. The JIT callback
can help to achieve this without keeping a list of the
currently JIT studied patterns.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">(6) OK, the
stack is for long term memory allocation. But what happens
if a pattern causes stack overflow with a stack of 1M? Is
that 1M kept until the stack is freed?</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Especially on
embedded sytems, it might be a good idea to release memory
sometimes without freeing the stack. There is no API for
this at the moment. Probably a function call which returns
with the currently allocated memory for any stack and
another which allows releasing memory (shrinking the stack)
would be a good idea if someone needs this.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">(7) This is too
much of a headache. Isn&rsquo;t there any better solution
for JIT stack handling?</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">No, thanks to
Windows. If POSIX threads were used everywhere, we could
throw out this complicated API.</p>

<h2>EXAMPLE CODE
<a name="EXAMPLE CODE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This is a
single-threaded example that specifies a JIT stack without
using a callback.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">int rc; <br>
int ovector[30]; <br>
pcre *re; <br>
pcre_extra *extra; <br>
pcre_jit_stack *jit_stack;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">re =
pcre_compile(pattern, 0, &amp;error, &amp;erroffset, NULL);
<br>
/* Check for errors */ <br>
extra = pcre_study(re, PCRE_STUDY_JIT_COMPILE, &amp;error);
<br>
jit_stack = pcre_jit_stack_alloc(32*1024, 512*1024); <br>
/* Check for error (NULL) */ <br>
pcre_assign_jit_stack(extra, NULL, jit_stack); <br>
rc = pcre_exec(re, extra, subject, length, 0, 0, ovector,
30); <br>
/* Check results */ <br>
pcre_free(re); <br>
pcre_free_study(extra); <br>
pcre_jit_stack_free(jit_stack);</p>

<h2>JIT FAST PATH API
<a name="JIT FAST PATH API"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Because the API
described above falls back to interpreted execution when JIT
is not available, it is convenient for programs that are
written for general use in many environments. However,
calling JIT via <b>pcre_exec()</b> does have a performance
impact. Programs that are written for use where JIT is known
to be available, and which need the best possible
performance, can instead use a &quot;fast path&quot; API to
call JIT execution directly instead of calling
<b>pcre_exec()</b> (obviously only for patterns that have
been successfully studied by JIT).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The fast path
function is called <b>pcre_jit_exec()</b>, and it takes
exactly the same arguments as <b>pcre_exec()</b>, plus one
additional argument that must point to a JIT stack. The JIT
stack arrangements described above do not apply. The return
values are the same as for <b>pcre_exec()</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When you call
<b>pcre_exec()</b>, as well as testing for invalid options,
a number of other sanity checks are performed on the
arguments. For example, if the subject pointer is NULL, or
its length is negative, an immediate error is given. Also,
unless PCRE_NO_UTF[8|16|32] is set, a UTF subject string is
tested for validity. In the interests of speed, these checks
do not happen on the JIT fast path, and if invalid data is
passed, the result is undefined.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Bypassing the
sanity checks and the <b>pcre_exec()</b> wrapping can give
speedups of more than 10%.</p>
