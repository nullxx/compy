<h2>NOTES
<a name="NOTES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When one side
of an <small>SSL/TLS</small> communication wants to inform
the peer about a special situation, it sends an alert. The
alert is sent as a special message and does not influence
the normal data stream (unless its contents results in the
communication being canceled).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A warning alert
is sent, when a non-fatal error condition occurs. The
&quot;close notify&quot; alert is sent as a warning alert.
Other examples for non-fatal errors are certificate errors
(&quot;certificate expired&quot;, &quot;unsupported
certificate&quot;), for which a warning alert may be sent.
(The sending party may however decide to send a fatal
error.) The receiving side may cancel the connection on
reception of a warning alert on it discretion.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Several alert
messages must be sent as fatal alert messages as specified
by the <small>TLS RFC. A</small> fatal alert always leads to
a connection abort.</p>

<h2>RETURN VALUES
<a name="RETURN VALUES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
strings can occur for <i>SSL_alert_type_string()</i> or
<i>SSL_alert_type_string_long()</i>: <br>
&quot;W&quot;/&quot;warning&quot; <br>
&quot;F&quot;/&quot;fatal&quot; <br>
&quot;U&quot;/&quot;unknown&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This indicates that no support
is available for this alert type. Probably <b>value</b> does
not contain a correct alert message.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
strings can occur for <i>SSL_alert_desc_string()</i> or
<i>SSL_alert_desc_string_long()</i>: <br>
&quot; <small>CN&quot;/</small> &quot;close notify&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The connection shall be closed.
This is a warning alert.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot; <small>UM&quot;/</small>
&quot;unexpected message&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">An inappropriate message was
received. This alert is always fatal and should never be
observed in communication between proper
implementations.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot; <small>BM&quot;/</small>
&quot;bad record mac&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This alert is returned if a
record is received with an incorrect <small>MAC.</small>
This message is always fatal.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot; <small>DF&quot;/</small>
&quot;decompression failure&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The decompression function
received improper input (e.g. data that would expand to
excessive length). This message is always fatal.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot; <small>HF&quot;/</small>
&quot;handshake failure&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Reception of a
handshake_failure alert message indicates that the sender
was unable to negotiate an acceptable set of security
parameters given the options available. This is a fatal
error.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot; <small>NC&quot;/</small>
&quot;no certificate&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A client, that was asked to
send a certificate, does not send a certificate (SSLv3
only).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot; <small>BC&quot;/</small>
&quot;bad certificate&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A certificate was corrupt,
contained signatures that did not verify correctly, etc</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot; <small>UC&quot;/</small>
&quot;unsupported certificate&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A certificate was of an
unsupported type.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot; <small>CR&quot;/</small>
&quot;certificate revoked&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A certificate was revoked by
its signer.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot; <small>CE&quot;/</small>
&quot;certificate expired&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A certificate has expired or is
not currently valid.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot; <small>CU&quot;/</small>
&quot;certificate unknown&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Some other (unspecified) issue
arose in processing the certificate, rendering it
unacceptable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot; <small>IP&quot;/</small>
&quot;illegal parameter&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A field in the handshake was
out of range or inconsistent with other fields. This is
always fatal.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot; <small>DC&quot;/</small>
&quot;decryption failed&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A TLSCiphertext decrypted in an
invalid way: either it wasn&rsquo;t an even multiple of the
block length or its padding values, when checked,
weren&rsquo;t correct. This message is always fatal.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot; <small>RO&quot;/</small>
&quot;record overflow&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A TLSCiphertext record was
received which had a length more than 2^14+2048 bytes, or a
record decrypted to a TLSCompressed record with more than
2^14+1024 bytes. This message is always fatal.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot; <small>CA&quot;/</small>
&quot;unknown <small>CA&quot;</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A valid certificate chain or
partial chain was received, but the certificate was not
accepted because the <small>CA</small> certificate could not
be located or couldn&rsquo;t be matched with a known,
trusted <small>CA.</small> This message is always fatal.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot; <small>AD&quot;/</small>
&quot;access denied&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A valid certificate was
received, but when access control was applied, the sender
decided not to proceed with negotiation. This message is
always fatal.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot; <small>DE&quot;/</small>
&quot;decode error&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A message could not be decoded
because some field was out of the specified range or the
length of the message was incorrect. This message is always
fatal.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot; <small>CY&quot;/</small>
&quot;decrypt error&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A handshake cryptographic
operation failed, including being unable to correctly verify
a signature, decrypt a key exchange, or validate a finished
message.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot; <small>ER&quot;/</small>
&quot;export restriction&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A negotiation not in compliance
with export restrictions was detected; for example,
attempting to transfer a 1024 bit ephemeral
<small>RSA</small> key for the <small>RSA_EXPORT</small>
handshake method. This message is always fatal.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot; <small>PV&quot;/</small>
&quot;protocol version&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The protocol version the client
has attempted to negotiate is recognized, but not supported.
(For example, old protocol versions might be avoided for
security reasons). This message is always fatal.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot; <small>IS&quot;/</small>
&quot;insufficient security&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Returned instead of
handshake_failure when a negotiation has failed specifically
because the server requires ciphers more secure than those
supported by the client. This message is always fatal.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot; <small>IE&quot;/</small>
&quot;internal error&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">An internal error unrelated to
the peer or the correctness of the protocol makes it
impossible to continue (such as a memory allocation
failure). This message is always fatal.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot; <small>US&quot;/</small>
&quot;user canceled&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This handshake is being
canceled for some reason unrelated to a protocol failure. If
the user cancels an operation after the handshake is
complete, just closing the connection by sending a
close_notify is more appropriate. This alert should be
followed by a close_notify. This message is generally a
warning.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot; <small>NR&quot;/</small>
&quot;no renegotiation&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Sent by the client in response
to a hello request or by the server in response to a client
hello after initial handshaking. Either of these would
normally lead to renegotiation; when that is not
appropriate, the recipient should respond with this alert;
at that point, the original requester can decide whether to
proceed with the connection. One case where this would be
appropriate would be where a server has spawned a process to
satisfy a request; the process might receive security
parameters (key length, authentication, etc.) at startup and
it might be difficult to communicate changes to these
parameters after that point. This message is always a
warning.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot; <small>UP&quot;/</small>
&quot;unknown <small>PSK</small> identity&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Sent by the server to indicate
that it does not recognize a <small>PSK</small> identity or
an <small>SRP</small> identity.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot; <small>UK&quot;/</small>
&quot;unknown&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This indicates that no
description is available for this alert type. Probably
<b>value</b> does not contain a correct alert message.</p>
