[<i>COMMAND</i>]</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">update&minus;ca&minus;trust(8)
is used to manage a consolidated and dynamic configuration
feature of Certificate Authority (CA) certificates and
associated trust.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The feature is
available for new applications that read the consolidated
configuration files found in the
/etc/pki/ca&minus;trust/extracted directory or that load the
PKCS#11 module p11&minus;kit&minus;trust.so</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Parts of the
new feature are also provided in a way to make it useful for
legacy applications.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Many legacy
applications expect CA certificates and trust configuration
in a fixed location, contained in files with particular path
and name, or by referring to a classic PKCS#11 trust module
provided by the NSS cryptographic library.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The dynamic
configuration feature provides functionally compatible
replacements for classic configuration files and for the
classic NSS trust module named libnssckbi.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In order to
enable legacy applications, that read the classic files or
access the classic module, to make use of the new
consolidated and dynamic configuration feature, the classic
filenames have been changed to symbolic links. The symbolic
links refer to dynamically created and consolidated output
stored below the /etc/pki/ca&minus;trust/extracted directory
hierarchy.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The output is
produced using the <i>update&minus;ca&minus;trust</i>
command (without parameters), or using the
<i>update&minus;ca&minus;trust extract</i> command. In order
to produce the output, a flexible set of source
configuration is read, as described in section SOURCE
CONFIGURATION.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In addition,
the classic PKCS#11 module is replaced with a new PKCS#11
module (p11&minus;kit&minus;trust.so) that dynamically reads
the same source configuration.</p>

<h2>SOURCE CONFIGURATION
<a name="SOURCE CONFIGURATION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The dynamic
configuration feature uses several source directories that
will be scanned for any number of source files. <b>It is
important to select the correct subdirectory for adding
files, as the subdirectory defines how contained
certificates will be trusted or distrusted, and which file
formats are read.</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Files in
<b>subdirectories below the directory hierarchy
/usr/share/pki/ca&minus;trust&minus;source/</b> contain CA
certificates and trust settings in the PEM file format. The
trust settings found here will be interpreted with a <b>low
priority</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Files in
<b>subdirectories below the directory hierarchy
/etc/pki/ca&minus;trust/source/</b> contain CA certificates
and trust settings in the PEM file format. The trust
settings found here will be interpreted with a <b>high
priority</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>You may use
the following rules of thumb to decide, whether your
configuration files should be added to the /etc or rather to
the /usr directory hierarchy:</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; If you
are manually adding a configuration file to a system, you
probably want it to override any other default
configuration, and you most likely should add it to the
respective subdirectory in the /etc hierarchy.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; If you
are creating a package that provides additional root CA
certificates, that is intended for distribution to several
computer systems, but you still want to allow the
administrator to override your list, then your package
should add your files to the respective subdirectory in the
/usr hierarchy.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; If you
are creating a package that is supposed to override the
default system trust settings, that is intended for
distribution to several computer systems, then your package
should install the files to the respective subdirectory in
the /etc hierarchy.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>QUICK HELP
1: To add a certificate in the simple PEM or DER file
formats to the list of CAs trusted on the system:</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; add it
as a new file to directory
/etc/pki/ca&minus;trust/source/anchors/</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; run
<i>update&minus;ca&minus;trust extract</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>QUICK HELP
2: If your certificate is in the extended BEGIN TRUSTED file
format (which may contain distrust/blacklist trust flags, or
trust flags for usages other than TLS) then:</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; add it
as a new file to directory
/etc/pki/ca&minus;trust/source/</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; run
<i>update&minus;ca&minus;trust extract</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>In order to
offer simplicity and flexibility, the way certificate files
are treated depends on the subdirectory they are installed
to.</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; simple
trust anchors subdirectory:
/usr/share/pki/ca&minus;trust&minus;source/anchors/ or
/etc/pki/ca&minus;trust/source/anchors/</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; simple
blacklist (distrust) subdirectory:
/usr/share/pki/ca&minus;trust&minus;source/blacklist/ or
/etc/pki/ca&minus;trust/source/blacklist/</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; extended
format directory:
/usr/share/pki/ca&minus;trust&minus;source/ or
/etc/pki/ca&minus;trust/source/</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>In the main
directories /usr/share/pki/ca&minus;trust&minus;source/ or
/etc/pki/ca&minus;trust/source/ you may install one or
multiple files in the following file formats:</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
certificate files that include trust flags, in the BEGIN/END
TRUSTED CERTIFICATE file format (any file name), which have
been created using the openssl x509 tool and the
&minus;addreject &minus;addtrust options. Bundle files with
multiple certificates are supported.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; files in
the p11&minus;kit file format using the .p11&minus;kit file
name extension, which can (e.g.) be used to distrust
certificates based on serial number and issuer name, without
having the full certificate available. (This is currently an
undocumented format, to be extended later. For examples of
the supported formats, see the files shipped with the
ca&minus;certificates package.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
certificate files without trust flags in either the DER file
format or in the PEM (BEGIN/END CERTIFICATE) file format
(any file name). Such files will be added with neutral
trust, neither trusted nor distrusted. They will simply be
known to the system, which might be helpful to assist
cryptographic software in constructing chains of
certificates. (If you want a CA certificate in these file
formats to be trusted, you should remove it from this
directory and move it to the ./anchors subdirectory
instead.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In the anchors
subdirectories
/usr/share/pki/ca&minus;trust&minus;source/anchors/ or
/etc/pki/ca&minus;trust/source/anchors/ you may install one
or multiple certificates in either the DER file format or in
the PEM (BEGIN/END CERTIFICATE) file format. Each
certificate will be treated as <b>trusted</b> for all
purposes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In the
blacklist subdirectories
/usr/share/pki/ca&minus;trust&minus;source/blacklist/ or
/etc/pki/ca&minus;trust/source/blacklist/ you may install
one or multiple certificates in either the DER file format
or in the PEM (BEGIN/END CERTIFICATE) file format. Each
certificate will be treated as <b>distrusted</b> for all
purposes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Please refer to
the x509(1) manual page for the documentation of the
BEGIN/END CERTIFICATE and BEGIN/END TRUSTED CERTIFICATE file
formats.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Applications
that rely on a static file for a list of trusted CAs may
load one of the files found in the
/etc/pki/ca&minus;trust/extracted directory. After modifying
any file in the /usr/share/pki/ca&minus;trust&minus;source/
or /etc/pki/ca&minus;trust/source/ directories or in any of
their subdirectories, or after adding a file, it is
necessary to run the <i>update&minus;ca&minus;trust
extract</i> command, in order to update the consolidated
files in /etc/pki/ca&minus;trust/extracted/ .</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Applications
that load the classic PKCS#11 module using filename
libnssckbi.so (which has been converted into a symbolic link
pointing to the new module) and any application capable of
loading PKCS#11 modules and loading
p11&minus;kit&minus;trust.so, will benefit from the
dynamically merged set of certificates and trust information
stored in the /usr/share/pki/ca&minus;trust&minus;source/
and /etc/pki/ca&minus;trust/source/ directories.</p>

<h2>EXTRACTED CONFIGURATION
<a name="EXTRACTED CONFIGURATION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The directory
/etc/pki/ca&minus;trust/extracted/ contains generated CA
certificate bundle files which are created and updated,
based on the SOURCE CONFIGURATION by running the
<i>update&minus;ca&minus;trust extract</i> command.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If your
application isn&rsquo;t able to load the PKCS#11 module
p11&minus;kit&minus;trust.so, then you can use these files
in your application to load a list of global root CA
certificates.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Please never
manually edit the files stored in this directory, because
your changes will be lost and the files automatically
overwritten, each time the <i>update&minus;ca&minus;trust

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In order to
install new trusted or distrusted certificates, please
rather install them in the respective subdirectory below the
