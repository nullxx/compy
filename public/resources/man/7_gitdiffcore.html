<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">gitdiffcore
&minus; Tweaking diff output</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>git diff</i>
*</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The diff
commands <i>git diff&minus;index</i>, <i>git
diff&minus;files</i>, and <i>git diff&minus;tree</i> can be
told to manipulate differences they find in unconventional
ways before showing <i>diff</i> output. The manipulation is
collectively called &quot;diffcore transformation&quot;.
This short note describes what they are and how to use them
to produce <i>diff</i> output that is easier to understand
than the conventional kind.</p>

<h2>THE CHAIN OF OPERATION
<a name="THE CHAIN OF OPERATION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The <i>git
diff&minus;*</i> family works by first comparing two sets of
files:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; <i>git
diff&minus;index</i> compares contents of a &quot;tree&quot;
object and the working directory (when
<i>&minus;&minus;cached</i> flag is not used) or a
&quot;tree&quot; object and the index file (when
<i>&minus;&minus;cached</i> flag is used);</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; <i>git
diff&minus;files</i> compares contents of the index file and
the working directory;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; <i>git
diff&minus;tree</i> compares contents of two
&quot;tree&quot; objects;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In all of these
cases, the commands themselves first optionally limit the
two sets of files by any pathspecs given on their
command&minus;lines, and compare corresponding paths in the
two resulting sets of files.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The pathspecs
are used to limit the world diff operates in. They remove
the filepairs outside the specified sets of pathnames. E.g.
If the input set of filepairs included:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">:100644 100644
bcd1234... 0123456... M junkfile</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">but the command
invocation was git diff&minus;files myfile, then the
junkfile entry would be removed from the list because only
&quot;myfile&quot; is under consideration.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The result of
comparison is passed from these commands to what is
internally called &quot;diffcore&quot;, in a format similar
to what is output when the &minus;p option is not used.
E.g.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">in&minus;place
edit :100644 100644 bcd1234... 0123456... M file0 <br>
create :000000 100644 0000000... 1234567... A file4 <br>
delete :100644 000000 1234567... 0000000... D file5 <br>
unmerged :000000 000000 0000000... 0000000... U file6</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The diffcore
mechanism is fed a list of such comparison results (each of
which is called &quot;filepair&quot;, although at this point
each of them talks about a single file), and transforms such
a list into another list. There are currently 5 such
transformations:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
diffcore&minus;break</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
diffcore&minus;rename</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
diffcore&minus;merge&minus;broken</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
diffcore&minus;pickaxe</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
diffcore&minus;order</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These are
applied in sequence. The set of filepairs <i>git
diff&minus;*</i> commands find are used as the input to
diffcore&minus;break, and the output from
diffcore&minus;break is used as the input to the next
transformation. The final result is then passed to the
output routine and generates either diff&minus;raw format
(see Output format sections of the manual for <i>git
diff&minus;*</i> commands) or diff&minus;patch format.</p>

<h2>DIFFCORE-BREAK: FOR SPLITTING UP COMPLETE REWRITES&quot;&quot;
<a name="DIFFCORE-BREAK: FOR SPLITTING UP COMPLETE REWRITES&quot;&quot;"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The second
transformation in the chain is diffcore&minus;break, and is
controlled by the &minus;B option to the <i>git
diff&minus;*</i> commands. This is used to detect a filepair
that represents &quot;complete rewrite&quot; and break such
filepair into two filepairs that represent delete and
create. E.g. If the input contained this filepair:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">:100644 100644
bcd1234... 0123456... M file0</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">and if it
detects that the file &quot;file0&quot; is completely
rewritten, it changes it to:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">:100644 000000
bcd1234... 0000000... D file0 <br>
:000000 100644 0000000... 0123456... A file0</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For the purpose
of breaking a filepair, diffcore&minus;break examines the
extent of changes between the contents of the files before
and after modification (i.e. the contents that have
&quot;bcd1234...&quot; and &quot;0123456...&quot; as their
SHA&minus;1 content ID, in the above example). The amount of
deletion of original contents and insertion of new material
are added together, and if it exceeds the &quot;break
score&quot;, the filepair is broken into two. The break
score defaults to 50% of the size of the smaller of the
original and the result (i.e. if the edit shrinks the file,
the size of the result is used; if the edit lengthens the
file, the size of the original is used), and can be
customized by giving a number after &quot;&minus;B&quot;
option (e.g. &quot;&minus;B75&quot; to tell it to use
75%).</p>

<h2>DIFFCORE-RENAME: FOR DETECTION RENAMES AND COPIES
<a name="DIFFCORE-RENAME: FOR DETECTION RENAMES AND COPIES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This
transformation is used to detect renames and copies, and is
controlled by the &minus;M option (to detect renames) and
the &minus;C option (to detect copies as well) to the <i>git
diff&minus;*</i> commands. If the input contained these
filepairs:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">:100644 000000
0123456... 0000000... D fileX <br>
:000000 100644 0000000... 0123456... A file0</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">and the
contents of the deleted file fileX is similar enough to the
contents of the created file file0, then rename detection
merges these filepairs and creates:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">:100644 100644
0123456... 0123456... R100 fileX file0</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When the
&quot;&minus;C&quot; option is used, the original contents
of modified files, and deleted files (and also unmodified
files, if the
&quot;&minus;&minus;find&minus;copies&minus;harder&quot;
option is used) are considered as candidates of the source
files in rename/copy operation. If the input were like these
filepairs, that talk about a modified file fileY and a newly
created file file0:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">:100644 100644
0123456... 1234567... M fileY <br>
:000000 100644 0000000... bcd3456... A file0</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">the original
contents of fileY and the resulting contents of file0 are
compared, and if they are similar enough, they are changed
to:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">:100644 100644
0123456... 1234567... M fileY <br>
:100644 100644 0123456... bcd3456... C100 fileY file0</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In both rename
and copy detection, the same &quot;extent of changes&quot;
algorithm used in diffcore&minus;break is used to determine
if two files are &quot;similar enough&quot;, and can be
customized to use a similarity score different from the
default of 50% by giving a number after the
&quot;&minus;M&quot; or &quot;&minus;C&quot; option (e.g.
&quot;&minus;M8&quot; to tell it to use 8/10 = 80%).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note. When the
&quot;&minus;C&quot; option is used with
&minus;&minus;find&minus;copies&minus;harder option, <i>git
diff&minus;*</i> commands feed unmodified filepairs to
diffcore mechanism as well as modified ones. This lets the
copy detector consider unmodified files as copy source
candidates at the expense of making it slower. Without
&minus;&minus;find&minus;copies&minus;harder, <i>git
diff&minus;*</i> commands can detect copies only if the file
that was copied happened to have been modified in the same
changeset.</p>

<h2>DIFFCORE-MERGE-BROKEN: FOR PUTTING COMPLETE REWRITES&quot; BACK TOGETHER&quot;
<a name="DIFFCORE-MERGE-BROKEN: FOR PUTTING COMPLETE REWRITES&quot; BACK TOGETHER&quot;"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This
transformation is used to merge filepairs broken by
diffcore&minus;break, and not transformed into rename/copy
by diffcore&minus;rename, back into a single modification.
This always runs when diffcore&minus;break is used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For the purpose
of merging broken filepairs back, it uses a different
&quot;extent of changes&quot; computation from the ones used
by diffcore&minus;break and diffcore&minus;rename. It counts
only the deletion from the original, and does not count
insertion. If you removed only 10 lines from a
100&minus;line document, even if you added 910 new lines to
make a new 1000&minus;line document, you did not do a
complete rewrite. diffcore&minus;break breaks such a case in
order to help diffcore&minus;rename to consider such
filepairs as candidate of rename/copy detection, but if
filepairs broken that way were not matched with other
filepairs to create rename/copy, then this transformation
merges them back into the original
&quot;modification&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;extent of changes&quot; parameter can be tweaked from
the default 80% (that is, unless more than 80% of the
original material is deleted, the broken pairs are merged
back into a single modification) by giving a second number
to &minus;B option, like these:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
&minus;B50/60 (give 50% &quot;break score&quot; to
diffcore&minus;break, use 60% for
diffcore&minus;merge&minus;broken).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
&minus;B/60 (the same as above, since diffcore&minus;break
defaults to 50%).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
earlier implementation left a broken pair as a separate
creation and deletion patches. This was an unnecessary hack
and the latest implementation always merges all the broken
pairs back into modifications, but the resulting patch
output is formatted differently for easier review in case of
such a complete rewrite by showing the entire contents of
old version prefixed with <i>&minus;</i>, followed by the
entire contents of new version prefixed with <i>+</i>.</p>

<h2>DIFFCORE-PICKAXE: FOR DETECTING ADDITION/DELETION OF SPECIFIED STRING
<a name="DIFFCORE-PICKAXE: FOR DETECTING ADDITION/DELETION OF SPECIFIED STRING"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This
transformation is used to find filepairs that represent
changes that touch a specified string, and is controlled by
the &minus;S option and the &minus;&minus;pickaxe&minus;all
option to the <i>git diff&minus;*</i> commands.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When
diffcore&minus;pickaxe is in use, it checks if there are
filepairs whose &quot;result&quot; side and whose
&quot;origin&quot; side have different number of specified
string. Such a filepair represents &quot;the string appeared
in this changeset&quot;. It also checks for the opposite
case that loses the specified string.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When
&minus;&minus;pickaxe&minus;all is not in effect,
diffcore&minus;pickaxe leaves only such filepairs that touch
the specified string in its output. When
&minus;&minus;pickaxe&minus;all is used,
diffcore&minus;pickaxe leaves all filepairs intact if there
is such a filepair, or makes the output empty otherwise. The
latter behaviour is designed to make reviewing of the
changes in the context of the whole changeset easier.</p>

<h2>DIFFCORE-ORDER: FOR SORTING THE OUTPUT BASED ON FILENAMES
<a name="DIFFCORE-ORDER: FOR SORTING THE OUTPUT BASED ON FILENAMES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This is used to
reorder the filepairs according to the user&rsquo;s (or
project&rsquo;s) taste, and is controlled by the &minus;O
option to the <i>git diff&minus;*</i> commands.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This takes a
text file each of whose lines is a shell glob pattern.
Filepairs that match a glob pattern on an earlier line in
the file are output before ones that match a later line, and
filepairs that do not match any glob pattern are output
last.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As an example,
a typical orderfile for the core Git probably would look
like this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">README <br>
Makefile <br>
Documentation <br>
*.h <br>
*.c <br>
t</p>
