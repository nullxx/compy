<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">perlpodstyle
&minus; Perl POD style guide</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These are
general guidelines for how to write <small>POD</small>
documentation for Perl scripts and modules, based on general
guidelines for writing good <small>UNIX</small> man pages.
All of these guidelines are, of course, optional, but
following them will make your documentation more consistent
with other documentation on the system.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The name of the
program being documented is conventionally written in bold
(using B&lt;&gt;) wherever it occurs, as are all program
options. Arguments should be written in italics (I&lt;&gt;).
Function names are traditionally written in italics; if you
write a function as <i>function()</i>, Pod::Man will take
care of this for you. Literal code or commands should be in
C&lt;&gt;. References to other man pages should be in the
form <tt>&quot;manpage(section)&quot;</tt> or
<tt>&quot;L&lt;manpage(section)&gt;&quot;</tt>, and Pod::Man
will automatically format those appropriately. The second
form, with L&lt;&gt;, is used to request that a
<small>POD</small> formatter make a link to the man page if
possible. As an exception, one normally omits the section
when referring to module documentation since it&rsquo;s not
clear what section module documentation will be in; use
<tt>&quot;L&lt;Module::Name&gt;&quot;</tt> for module
references instead.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">References to
other programs or functions are normally in the form of man
page references so that cross-referencing tools can provide
the user with links and the like. It&rsquo;s possible to
overdo this, though, so be careful not to clutter your
documentation with too much markup. References to other
programs that are not given as man page references should be
enclosed in B&lt;&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The major
headers should be set out using a
<tt>&quot;=head1&quot;</tt> directive, and are historically
written in the rather startling <small>ALL UPPER
CASE</small> format; this is not mandatory, but it&rsquo;s
strongly recommended so that sections have consistent naming
across different software packages. Minor headers may be
included using <tt>&quot;=head2&quot;</tt>, and are
typically in mixed case.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The standard
sections of a manual page are: <small><br>
NAME</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Mandatory section; should be a
comma-separated list of programs or functions documented by
this <small>POD</small> page, such as:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    foo, bar &minus; programs to do something</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Manual page
indexers are often extremely picky about the format of this
section, so don&rsquo;t put anything in it except this line.
Every program or function documented by this
<small>POD</small> page should be listed, separated by a
comma and a space. For a Perl module, just give the module
name. A single dash, and only a single dash, should separate
the list of programs or functions from the description. Do
not use any markup such as C&lt;&gt; or B&lt;&gt; anywhere
in this line. Functions should not be qualified with
<tt>&quot;()&quot;</tt> or the like. The description should
ideally fit on a single line, even if a man program replaces
the dash with a few tabs.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><small>SYNOPSIS</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A short usage summary for
programs and functions. This section is mandatory for
section 3 pages. For Perl module documentation, it&rsquo;s
usually convenient to have the contents of this section be a
verbatim block showing some (brief) examples of typical ways
the module is used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><small>DESCRIPTION</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Extended description and
discussion of the program or functions, or the body of the
documentation for man pages that document something else. If
particularly long, it&rsquo;s a good idea to break this up
into subsections <tt>&quot;=head2&quot;</tt> directives
like:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    =head2 Normal Usage
    =head2 Advanced Features
    =head2 Writing Configuration Files</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">or whatever is
appropriate for your documentation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">For a module,
this is generally where the documentation of the interfaces
provided by the module goes, usually in the form of a list
with an <tt>&quot;=item&quot;</tt> for each interface.
Depending on how many interfaces there are, you may want to
put that documentation in separate <small>METHODS,
FUNCTIONS, CLASS METHODS,</small> or <small>INSTANCE
METHODS</small> sections instead and save the
<small>DESCRIPTION</small> section for an overview.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><small>OPTIONS</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Detailed description of each of
the command-line options taken by the program. This should
be separate from the description for the use of parsers like
Pod::Usage. This is normally presented as a list, with each
option as a separate <tt>&quot;=item&quot;</tt>. The
specific option string should be enclosed in B&lt;&gt;. Any
values that the option takes should be enclosed in
I&lt;&gt;. For example, the section for the option
<b>&minus;&minus;section</b>=<i>manext</i> would be
introduced with:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    =item B&lt;&minus;&minus;section&gt;=I&lt;manext&gt;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Synonymous
options (like both the short and long forms) are separated
by a comma and a space on the same
<tt>&quot;=item&quot;</tt> line, or optionally listed as
their own item with a reference to the canonical name. For
example, since <b>&minus;&minus;section</b> can also be
written as <b>&minus;s</b>, the above would be:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    =item B&lt;&minus;s&gt; I&lt;manext&gt;, B&lt;&minus;&minus;section&gt;=I&lt;manext&gt;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Writing the
short option first is recommended because it&rsquo;s easier
to read. The long option is long enough to draw the eye to
it anyway and the short option can otherwise get lost in
visual noise.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><small>RETURN VALUE</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">What the program or function
returns, if successful. This section can be omitted for
programs whose precise exit codes aren&rsquo;t important,
provided they return 0 on success and non-zero on failure as
is standard. It should always be present for functions. For
modules, it may be useful to summarize return values from
the module interface here, or it may be more useful to
discuss return values separately in the documentation of
each function or method the module provides.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><small>ERRORS</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Exceptions, error return codes,
exit statuses, and errno settings. Typically used for
function or module documentation; program documentation uses
<small>DIAGNOSTICS</small> instead. The general rule of
thumb is that errors printed to <tt>&quot;STDOUT&quot;</tt>
or <tt>&quot;STDERR&quot;</tt> and intended for the end user
are documented in <small>DIAGNOSTICS</small> while errors
passed internal to the calling program and intended for
other programmers are documented in <small>ERRORS.</small>
When documenting a function that sets errno, a full list of
the possible errno values should be given here.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><small>DIAGNOSTICS</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">All possible messages the
program can print out and what they mean. You may wish to
follow the same documentation style as the Perl
documentation; see <i>perldiag</i>(1) for more details (and
look at the <small>POD</small> source as well).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If applicable,
please include details on what the user should do to correct
the error; documenting an error as indicating &quot;the
input buffer is too small&quot; without telling the user how
to increase the size of the input buffer (or at least
telling them that it isn&rsquo;t possible) aren&rsquo;t very
useful.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><small>EXAMPLES</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Give some example uses of the
program or function. Don&rsquo;t skimp; users often find
this the most useful part of the documentation. The examples
are generally given as verbatim paragraphs.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Don&rsquo;t
just present an example without explaining what it does.
Adding a short paragraph saying what the example will do can
increase the value of the example immensely.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><small>ENVIRONMENT</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Environment variables that the
program cares about, normally presented as a list using
<tt>&quot;=over&quot;</tt>, <tt>&quot;=item&quot;</tt>, and
<tt>&quot;=back&quot;</tt>. For example:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    =over 6
    =item HOME
    Used to determine the user's home directory.  F&lt;.foorc&gt; in this
    directory is read for configuration details, if it exists.
    =back</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Since
environment variables are normally in all uppercase, no
additional special formatting is generally needed;
they&rsquo;re glaring enough as it is.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><small>FILES</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">All files used by the program
or function, normally presented as a list, and what it uses
them for. File names should be enclosed in F&lt;&gt;.
It&rsquo;s particularly important to document files that
will be potentially modified.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><small>CAVEATS</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Things to take special care
with, sometimes called <small>WARNINGS.</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><small>BUGS</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Things that are broken or just
don&rsquo;t work quite right.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><small>RESTRICTIONS</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Bugs you don&rsquo;t plan to
fix. :&minus;)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><small>NOTES</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Miscellaneous commentary.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><small>AUTHOR</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Who wrote it (use
<small>AUTHORS</small> for multiple people). It&rsquo;s a
good idea to include your current e&minus;mail address (or
some e&minus;mail address to which bug reports should be
sent) or some other contact information so that users have a
way of contacting you. Remember that program documentation
tends to roam the wild for far longer than you expect and
pick a contact method that&rsquo;s likely to last.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><small>HISTORY</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Programs derived from other
sources sometimes have this. Some people keep a modification
log here, but that usually gets long and is normally better
maintained in a separate file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><small>COPYRIGHT AND
LICENSE</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">For copyright</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    Copyright YEAR(s) YOUR NAME(s)</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">(No, (C) is not
needed. No, &quot;all rights reserved&quot; is not
needed.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">For licensing
the easiest way is to use the same licensing as Perl
itself:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    This library is free software; you may redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the same terms as Perl itself.</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This makes it
easy for people to use your module with Perl. Note that this
licensing example is neither an endorsement or a
requirement, you are of course free to choose any
licensing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><small>SEE ALSO</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Other man pages to check out,
like <i>man</i>(1), <i>man</i>(7), <i>makewhatis</i>(8), or
<i>catman</i>(8). Normally a simple list of man pages
separated by commas, or a paragraph giving the name of a
reference work. Man page references, if they use the
standard <tt>&quot;name(section)&quot;</tt> form,
don&rsquo;t have to be enclosed in L&lt;&gt; (although
it&rsquo;s recommended), but other things in this section
probably should be when appropriate.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If the package
has a mailing list, include a <small>URL</small> or
subscription instructions here.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If the package
has a web site, include a <small>URL</small> here.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Documentation
of object-oriented libraries or modules may want to use
<small>CONSTRUCTORS</small> and <small>METHODS</small>
sections, or <small>CLASS METHODS</small> and
<small>INSTANCE METHODS</small> sections, for detailed
documentation of the parts of the library and save the
<small>DESCRIPTION</small> section for an overview. Large
modules with a function interface may want to use
<small>FUNCTIONS</small> for similar reasons. Some people
use <small>OVERVIEW</small> to summarize the description if
it&rsquo;s quite long.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Section
ordering varies, although <small>NAME</small> must always be
the first section (you&rsquo;ll break some man page systems
otherwise), and <small>NAME, SYNOPSIS, DESCRIPTION,</small>
and <small>OPTIONS</small> generally always occur first and
in that order if present. In general, <small>SEE ALSO,
AUTHOR,</small> and similar material should be left for
last. Some systems also move <small>WARNINGS</small> and
<small>NOTES</small> to last. The order given above should
be reasonable for most purposes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Some systems
use <small>CONFORMING TO</small> to note conformance to
relevant standards and MT-LEVEL to note safeness for use in
threaded programs or signal handlers. These headings are
primarily useful when documenting parts of a C library.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Finally, as a
general note, try not to use an excessive amount of markup.
As documented here and in Pod::Man, you can safely leave
Perl variables, function names, man page references, and the
like unadorned by markup and the <small>POD</small>
translators will figure it out for you. This makes it much
easier to later edit the documentation. Note that many
existing translators will do the wrong thing with
e&minus;mail addresses when wrapped in L&lt;&gt;, so
don&rsquo;t do that.</p>
