perl pragma to control sort() behaviour</p>

    use sort '_quicksort';      # use a quicksort algorithm

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">With the
<tt>&quot;sort&quot;</tt> pragma you can control the
behaviour of the builtin <tt>&quot;sort()&quot;</tt>
function.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In Perl
versions 5.6 and earlier the quicksort algorithm was used to
implement <tt>&quot;sort()&quot;</tt>, but in Perl 5.8 a
mergesort algorithm was also made available, mainly to
guarantee worst case O(N log N) behaviour: the worst case of
quicksort is O(N**2). In Perl 5.8 and later, quicksort
defends against quadratic behaviour by shuffling large
arrays before sorting.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A stable sort
means that for records that compare equal, the original
input ordering is preserved. Mergesort is stable, quicksort
is not. Stability will matter only if elements that compare
equal can be distinguished in some other way. That means
that simple numerical and lexical sorts do not profit from
stability, since equal elements are indistinguishable.
However, with a comparison such as</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">   { substr($a, 0, 3) cmp substr($b, 0, 3) }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">stability might
matter because elements that compare equal on the first 3
characters may be distinguished based on subsequent
characters. In Perl 5.8 and later, quicksort can be
stabilized, but doing so will add overhead, so it should
only be done if it matters.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The best
algorithm depends on many things. On average, mergesort does
fewer comparisons than quicksort, so it may be better when
complicated comparison routines are used. Mergesort also
takes advantage of pre-existing order, so it would be
favored for using <tt>&quot;sort()&quot;</tt> to merge
several sorted arrays. On the other hand, quicksort is often
faster for small arrays, and on arrays of a few distinct
values, repeated many times. You can force the choice of
algorithm with this pragma, but this feels heavy-handed, so
the subpragmas beginning with a <tt>&quot;_&quot;</tt> may
not persist beyond Perl 5.8. The default algorithm is
mergesort, which will be stable even if you do not
explicitly demand it. But the stability of the default sort
is a side-effect that could change in later versions. If
stability is important, be sure to say so with a</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  use sort 'stable';</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<tt>&quot;no sort&quot;</tt> pragma doesn&rsquo;t
<i>forbid</i> what follows, it just leaves the choice open.
Thus, after</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  no sort qw(_mergesort stable);</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">a mergesort,
which happens to be stable, will be employed anyway. Note
that</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  no sort &quot;_quicksort&quot;;
  no sort &quot;_mergesort&quot;;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">have exactly
the same effect, leaving the choice of sort algorithm
open.</p>

<h2>CAVEATS
<a name="CAVEATS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As of Perl
5.10, this pragma is lexically scoped and takes effect at
compile time. In earlier versions its effect was global and
took effect at run-time; the documentation suggested using
<tt>&quot;eval()&quot;</tt> to change the behaviour:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  { eval 'use sort qw(defaults _quicksort)'; # force quicksort
    eval 'no sort &quot;stable&quot;';      # stability not wanted
    print sort::current . &quot;\n&quot;;
    @a = sort @b;
    eval 'use sort &quot;defaults&quot;';   # clean up, for others
  }
  { eval 'use sort qw(defaults stable)';     # force stability
    print sort::current . &quot;\n&quot;;
    @c = sort @d;
    eval 'use sort &quot;defaults&quot;';   # clean up, for others
  }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Such code no
longer has the desired effect, for two reasons. Firstly, the
use of <tt>&quot;eval()&quot;</tt> means that the sorting
algorithm is not changed until runtime, by which time
it&rsquo;s too late to have any effect. Secondly,
<tt>&quot;sort::current&quot;</tt> is also called at
run-time, when in fact the compile-time value of
<tt>&quot;sort::current&quot;</tt> is the one that
matters.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">So now this
code would be written:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  { use sort qw(defaults _quicksort); # force quicksort
    no sort &quot;stable&quot;;      # stability not wanted
    my $current;
    BEGIN { $current = print sort::current; }
    print &quot;$current\n&quot;;
    @a = sort @b;
    # Pragmas go out of scope at the end of the block
  }
  { use sort qw(defaults stable);     # force stability
    my $current;
    BEGIN { $current = print sort::current; }
    print &quot;$current\n&quot;;
    @c = sort @d;
  }</pre>
