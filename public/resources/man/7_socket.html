&lt;sys/socket.h&gt;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>sockfd</i>
<b>= socket(int</b> <i>socket_family</i><b>, int</b>
<i>socket_type</i><b>, int</b> <i>protocol</i><b>);</b></p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This manual
page describes the Linux networking socket layer user
interface. The BSD compatible sockets are the uniform
interface between the user process and the network protocol
stacks in the kernel. The protocol modules are grouped into
<i>protocol families</i> like <b>AF_INET</b>, <b>AF_IPX</b>,
<b>AF_PACKET</b> and <i>socket types</i> like
<b>SOCK_STREAM</b> or <b>SOCK_DGRAM</b>. See
<b>socket</b>(2) for more information on families and
types.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Socket-layer
functions</b> <br>
These functions are used by the user process to send or
receive packets and to do other socket operations. For more
information see their respective manual pages.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>socket</b>(2)
creates a socket, <b>connect</b>(2) connects a socket to a
remote socket address, the <b>bind</b>(2) function binds a
socket to a local socket address, <b>listen</b>(2) tells the
socket that new connections shall be accepted, and
<b>accept</b>(2) is used to get a new socket with a new
incoming connection. <b>socketpair</b>(2) returns two
connected anonymous sockets (implemented only for a few
local families like <b>AF_UNIX</b>)</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>send</b>(2),
<b>sendto</b>(2), and <b>sendmsg</b>(2) send data over a
socket, and <b>recv</b>(2), <b>recvfrom</b>(2),
<b>recvmsg</b>(2) receive data from a socket. <b>poll</b>(2)
and <b>select</b>(2) wait for arriving data or a readiness
to send data. In addition, the standard I/O operations like
<b>write</b>(2), <b>writev</b>(2), <b>sendfile</b>(2),
<b>read</b>(2), and <b>readv</b>(2) can be used to read and
write data.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>getsockname</b>(2)
returns the local socket address and <b>getpeername</b>(2)
returns the remote socket address. <b>getsockopt</b>(2) and
<b>setsockopt</b>(2) are used to set or get socket layer or
protocol options. <b>ioctl</b>(2) can be used to set or read
some other options.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>close</b>(2)
is used to close a socket. <b>shutdown</b>(2) closes parts
of a full-duplex socket connection.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Seeking, or
calling <b>pread</b>(2) or <b>pwrite</b>(2) with a nonzero
position is not supported on sockets.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is possible
to do nonblocking I/O on sockets by setting the
<b>O_NONBLOCK</b> flag on a socket file descriptor using
<b>fcntl</b>(2). Then all operations that would block will
(usually) return with <b>EAGAIN</b> (operation should be
retried later); <b>connect</b>(2) will return
<b>EINPROGRESS</b> error. The user can then wait for various
events via <b>poll</b>(2) or <b>select</b>(2).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">An alternative
to <b>poll</b>(2) and <b>select</b>(2) is to let the kernel
inform the application about events via a <b>SIGIO</b>
signal. For that the <b>O_ASYNC</b> flag must be set on a
socket file descriptor via <b>fcntl</b>(2) and a valid
signal handler for <b>SIGIO</b> must be installed via
<b>sigaction</b>(2). See the <i>Signals</i> discussion
below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Socket
address structures</b> <br>
Each socket domain has its own format for socket addresses,
with a domain-specific address structure. Each of these
structures begins with an integer &quot;family&quot; field
(typed as <i>sa_family_t</i>) that indicates the type of the
address structure. This allows the various system calls
(e.g., <b>connect</b>(2), <b>bind</b>(2), <b>accept</b>(2),
<b>getsockname</b>(2), <b>getpeername</b>(2)), which are
generic to all socket domains, to determine the domain of a
particular socket address.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To allow any
type of socket address to be passed to interfaces in the
sockets API, the type <i>struct sockaddr</i> is defined. The
purpose of this type is purely to allow casting of
domain-specific socket address types to a
&quot;generic&quot; type, so as to avoid compiler warnings
about type mismatches in calls to the sockets API.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In addition,
the sockets API provides the data type <i>struct
sockaddr_storage</i>. This type is suitable to accommodate
all supported domain-specific socket address structures; it
is large enough and is aligned properly. (In particular, it
is large enough to hold IPv6 socket addresses.) The
structure includes the following field, which can be used to
identify the type of socket address actually stored in the
structure:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">sa_family_t
ss_family;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>sockaddr_storage</i> structure is useful in programs that
must handle socket addresses in a generic way (e.g.,
programs that must deal with both IPv4 and IPv6 socket
addresses).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Socket
options</b> <br>
The socket options listed below can be set by using
<b>setsockopt</b>(2) and read with <b>getsockopt</b>(2) with
the socket level set to <b>SOL_SOCKET</b> for all sockets.
Unless otherwise noted, <i>optval</i> is a pointer to an
<i>int</i>. <b><br>
SO_ACCEPTCONN</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Returns a value indicating
whether or not this socket has been marked to accept
connections with <b>listen</b>(2). The value 0 indicates
that this is not a listening socket, the value 1 indicates
that this is a listening socket. This socket option is
read-only.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SO_BINDTODEVICE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Bind this socket to a
particular device like &ldquo;eth0&rdquo;, as specified in
the passed interface name. If the name is an empty string or
the option length is zero, the socket device binding is
removed. The passed option is a variable-length
null-terminated interface name string with the maximum size
of <b>IFNAMSIZ</b>. If a socket is bound to an interface,
only packets received from that particular interface are
processed by the socket. Note that this works only for some
socket types, particularly <b>AF_INET</b> sockets. It is not
supported for packet sockets (use normal <b>bind</b>(2)
there).</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Before Linux
3.8, this socket option could be set, but could not
retrieved with <b>getsockopt</b>(2). Since Linux 3.8, it is
readable. The <i>optlen</i> argument should contain the
buffer size available to receive the device name and is
recommended to be <b>IFNAMSZ</b> bytes. The real device name
length is reported back in the <i>optlen</i> argument.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SO_BROADCAST</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set or get the broadcast flag.
When enabled, datagram sockets are allowed to send packets
to a broadcast address. This option has no effect on
stream-oriented sockets.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SO_BSDCOMPAT</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Enable BSD bug-to-bug
compatibility. This is used by the UDP protocol module in
Linux 2.0 and 2.2. If enabled ICMP errors received for a UDP
socket will not be passed to the user program. In later
kernel versions, support for this option has been phased
out: Linux 2.4 silently ignores it, and Linux 2.6 generates
a kernel warning (printk()) if a program uses this option.
Linux 2.0 also enabled BSD bug-to-bug compatibility options
(random header changing, skipping of the broadcast flag) for
raw sockets with this option, but that was removed in Linux
2.2.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SO_DEBUG</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Enable socket debugging. Only
allowed for processes with the <b>CAP_NET_ADMIN</b>
capability or an effective user ID of 0.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SO_DOMAIN</b> (since Linux
2.6.32)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Retrieves the socket domain as
an integer, returning a value such as <b>AF_INET6</b>. See
<b>socket</b>(2) for details. This socket option is
read-only.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SO_ERROR</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Get and clear the pending
socket error. This socket option is read-only. Expects an
integer.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SO_DONTROUTE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Don&rsquo;t send via a gateway,
send only to directly connected hosts. The same effect can
be achieved by setting the <b>MSG_DONTROUTE</b> flag on a
socket <b>send</b>(2) operation. Expects an integer boolean
flag.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SO_KEEPALIVE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Enable sending of keep-alive
messages on connection-oriented sockets. Expects an integer
boolean flag.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SO_LINGER</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Sets or gets the
<b>SO_LINGER</b> option. The argument is a <i>linger</i>
structure.</p>

<p style="margin-left:28%; margin-top: 1em">struct linger {
<br>
int l_onoff; /* linger active */ <br>
int l_linger; /* how many seconds to linger for */ <br>
};</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">When enabled, a
<b>close</b>(2) or <b>shutdown</b>(2) will not return until
all queued messages for the socket have been successfully
sent or the linger timeout has been reached. Otherwise, the
call returns immediately and the closing is done in the
background. When the socket is closed as part of
<b>exit</b>(2), it always lingers in the background.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SO_MARK</b> (since Linux
2.6.25)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set the mark for each packet
sent through this socket (similar to the netfilter MARK
target but socket-based). Changing the mark can be used for
mark-based routing without netfilter or for packet
filtering. Setting this option requires the
<b>CAP_NET_ADMIN</b> capability.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SO_OOBINLINE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If this option is enabled,
out-of-band data is directly placed into the receive data
stream. Otherwise out-of-band data is passed only when the
<b>MSG_OOB</b> flag is set during receiving.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SO_PASSCRED</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Enable or disable the receiving
of the <b>SCM_CREDENTIALS</b> control message. For more
information see <b>unix</b>(7).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SO_PEEK_OFF</b> (since Linux
3.4)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This option, which is currently
supported only for <b>unix</b>(7) sockets, sets the value of
the &quot;peek offset&quot; for the <b>recv(2)</b> system
call when used with <b>MSG_PEEK</b> flag.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">When this
option is set to a negative value (it is set to &minus;1 for
all new sockets), traditional behavior is provided:
<b>recv(2)</b> with the <b>MSG_PEEK</b> flag will peek data
from the front of the queue.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">When the option
is set to a value greater than or equal to zero, then the
next peek at data queued in the socket will occur at the
byte offset specified by the option value. At the same time,
the &quot;peek offset&quot; will be incremented by the
number of bytes that were peeked from the queue, so that a
subsequent peek will return the next data in the queue.i</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If data is
removed from the front of the queue via a call to
<b>recv</b>(2) (or similar) without the <b>MSG_PEEK</b>
flag, the &quot;peek offset&quot; will be decreased by the
number of bytes removed. In other words, receiving data
without the <b>MSG_PEEK</b> flag will cause the &quot;peek
offset&quot; to be adjusted to maintain the correct relative
position in the queued data, so that a subsequent peek will
retrieve the data that would have been retrieved had the
data not been removed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">For datagram
sockets, if the &quot;peek offset&quot; points to the middle
of a packet, the data returned will be marked with the
<b>MSG_TRUNC</b> flag.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The following
example serves to illustrate the use of <b>SO_PEEK_OFF</b>.
Suppose a stream socket has the following queued input
data:</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">aabbccddeeff</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The following
sequence of <b>recv</b>(2) calls would have the effect noted
in the comments:</p>

<p style="margin-left:28%; margin-top: 1em">int ov = 4; //
Set peek offset to 4 <br>
setsockopt(fd, SOL_SOCKET, SO_PEEK_OFF, &amp;ov,
sizeof(ov));</p>

<p style="margin-left:28%; margin-top: 1em">recv(fd, buf,
2, MSG_PEEK); // Peeks &quot;cc&quot;; offset set to 6 <br>
recv(fd, buf, 2, MSG_PEEK); // Peeks &quot;dd&quot;; offset
set to 8 <br>
recv(fd, buf, 2, 0); // Reads &quot;aa&quot;; offset set to
6 <br>
recv(fd, buf, 2, MSG_PEEK); // Peeks &quot;ee&quot;; offset
set to 8</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SO_PEERCRED</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Return the credentials of the
foreign process connected to this socket. This is possible
only for connected <b>AF_UNIX</b> stream sockets and
<b>AF_UNIX</b> stream and datagram socket pairs created
using <b>socketpair</b>(2); see <b>unix</b>(7). The returned
credentials are those that were in effect at the time of the
call to <b>connect</b>(2) or <b>socketpair</b>(2). The
argument is a <i>ucred</i> structure; define the
<b>GNU_SOURCE</b> feature test macro to obtain the
definition of that structure from
<i>&lt;sys/socket.h&gt;</i>. This socket option is
read-only.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SO_PRIORITY</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set the protocol-defined
priority for all packets to be sent on this socket. Linux
uses this value to order the networking queues: packets with
a higher priority may be processed first depending on the
selected device queueing discipline. For <b>ip</b>(7), this
also sets the IP type-of-service (TOS) field for outgoing
packets. Setting a priority outside the range 0 to 6
requires the <b>CAP_NET_ADMIN</b> capability.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SO_PROTOCOL</b> (since Linux
2.6.32)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Retrieves the socket protocol
as an integer, returning a value such as
<b>IPPROTO_SCTP</b>. See <b>socket</b>(2) for details. This
socket option is read-only.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SO_RCVBUF</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Sets or gets the maximum socket
receive buffer in bytes. The kernel doubles this value (to
allow space for bookkeeping overhead) when it is set using
<b>setsockopt</b>(2), and this doubled value is returned by
<b>getsockopt</b>(2). The default value is set by the
<i>/proc/sys/net/core/rmem_default</i> file, and the maximum
allowed value is set by the
<i>/proc/sys/net/core/rmem_max</i> file. The minimum
(doubled) value for this option is 256.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SO_RCVBUFFORCE</b> (since
Linux 2.6.14)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Using this socket option, a
privileged (<b>CAP_NET_ADMIN</b>) process can perform the
same task as <b>SO_RCVBUF</b>, but the <i>rmem_max</i> limit
can be overridden.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SO_RCVLOWAT</b> and
<b>SO_SNDLOWAT</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specify the minimum number of
bytes in the buffer until the socket layer will pass the
data to the protocol (<b>SO_SNDLOWAT</b>) or the user on
receiving (<b>SO_RCVLOWAT</b>). These two values are
initialized to 1. <b>SO_SNDLOWAT</b> is not changeable on
Linux (<b>setsockopt</b>(2) fails with the error
<b>ENOPROTOOPT</b>). <b>SO_RCVLOWAT</b> is changeable only
since Linux 2.4. The <b>select</b>(2) and <b>poll</b>(2)
system calls currently do not respect the <b>SO_RCVLOWAT</b>
setting on Linux, and mark a socket readable when even a
single byte of data is available. A subsequent read from the
socket will block until <b>SO_RCVLOWAT</b> bytes are
available.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SO_RCVTIMEO</b> and
<b>SO_SNDTIMEO</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specify the receiving or
sending timeouts until reporting an error. The argument is a
<i>struct timeval</i>. If an input or output function blocks
for this period of time, and data has been sent or received,
the return value of that function will be the amount of data
transferred; if no data has been transferred and the timeout
has been reached then &minus;1 is returned with <i>errno</i>
set to <b>EAGAIN</b> or <b>EWOULDBLOCK</b>, or
<b>EINPROGRESS</b> (for <b>connect</b>(2)) just as if the
socket was specified to be nonblocking. If the timeout is
set to zero (the default) then the operation will never
timeout. Timeouts only have effect for system calls that
perform socket I/O (e.g., <b>read</b>(2), <b>recvmsg</b>(2),
<b>send</b>(2), <b>sendmsg</b>(2)); timeouts have no effect
for <b>select</b>(2), <b>poll</b>(2), <b>epoll_wait</b>(2),
and so on.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SO_REUSEADDR</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Indicates that the rules used
in validating addresses supplied in a <b>bind</b>(2) call
should allow reuse of local addresses. For <b>AF_INET</b>
sockets this means that a socket may bind, except when there
is an active listening socket bound to the address. When the
listening socket is bound to <b>INADDR_ANY</b> with a
specific port then it is not possible to bind to this port
for any local address. Argument is an integer boolean
flag.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SO_SNDBUF</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Sets or gets the maximum socket
send buffer in bytes. The kernel doubles this value (to
allow space for bookkeeping overhead) when it is set using
<b>setsockopt</b>(2), and this doubled value is returned by
<b>getsockopt</b>(2). The default value is set by the
<i>/proc/sys/net/core/wmem_default</i> file and the maximum
allowed value is set by the
<i>/proc/sys/net/core/wmem_max</i> file. The minimum
(doubled) value for this option is 2048.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SO_SNDBUFFORCE</b> (since
Linux 2.6.14)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Using this socket option, a
privileged (<b>CAP_NET_ADMIN</b>) process can perform the
same task as <b>SO_SNDBUF</b>, but the <i>wmem_max</i> limit
can be overridden.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SO_TIMESTAMP</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Enable or disable the receiving
of the <b>SO_TIMESTAMP</b> control message. The timestamp
control message is sent with level <b>SOL_SOCKET</b> and the
<i>cmsg_data</i> field is a <i>struct timeval</i> indicating
the reception time of the last packet passed to the user in
this call. See <b>cmsg</b>(3) for details on control
messages.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SO_TYPE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Gets the socket type as an
integer (e.g., <b>SOCK_STREAM</b>). This socket option is
read-only.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Signals</b>
<br>
When writing onto a connection-oriented socket that has been
shut down (by the local or the remote end) <b>SIGPIPE</b> is
sent to the writing process and <b>EPIPE</b> is returned.
The signal is not sent when the write call specified the
<b>MSG_NOSIGNAL</b> flag.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When requested
with the <b>FIOSETOWN fcntl</b>(2) or <b>SIOCSPGRP
ioctl</b>(2), <b>SIGIO</b> is sent when an I/O event occurs.
It is possible to use <b>poll</b>(2) or <b>select</b>(2) in
the signal handler to find out which socket the event
occurred on. An alternative (in Linux 2.2) is to set a
real-time signal using the <b>F_SETSIG fcntl</b>(2); the
handler of the real time signal will be called with the file
descriptor in the <i>si_fd</i> field of its
<i>siginfo_t</i>. See <b>fcntl</b>(2) for more
information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Under some
circumstances (e.g., multiple processes accessing a single
socket), the condition that caused the <b>SIGIO</b> may have
already disappeared when the process reacts to the signal.
If this happens, the process should wait again because Linux
will resend the signal later.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>/proc
interfaces</b> <br>
The core socket networking parameters can be accessed via
files in the directory <i>/proc/sys/net/core/</i>. <i><br>
rmem_default</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">contains the default setting in
bytes of the socket receive buffer.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>rmem_max</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">contains the maximum socket
receive buffer size in bytes which a user may set by using
the <b>SO_RCVBUF</b> socket option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>wmem_default</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">contains the default setting in
bytes of the socket send buffer.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>wmem_max</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">contains the maximum socket
send buffer size in bytes which a user may set by using the
<b>SO_SNDBUF</b> socket option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>message_cost</i> and
<i>message_burst</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">configure the token bucket
filter used to load limit warning messages caused by
external network events.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>netdev_max_backlog</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Maximum number of packets in
the global input queue.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>optmem_max</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Maximum length of ancillary
data and user control data like the iovecs per socket.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Ioctls</b>
<br>
These operations can be accessed using <b>ioctl</b>(2):</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><i>error</i>
<b>= ioctl(</b><i>ip_socket</i><b>,</b>
<i>ioctl_type</i><b>,</b>
<i>&amp;value_result</i><b>);</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SIOCGSTAMP</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Return a <i>struct timeval</i>
with the receive timestamp of the last packet passed to the
user. This is useful for accurate round trip time
measurements. See <b>setitimer</b>(2) for a description of
<i>struct timeval</i>. This ioctl should be used only if the
socket option <b>SO_TIMESTAMP</b> is not set on the socket.
Otherwise, it returns the timestamp of the last packet that
was received while <b>SO_TIMESTAMP</b> was not set, or it
fails if no such packet has been received, (i.e.,
<b>ioctl</b>(2) returns &minus;1 with <i>errno</i> set to
<b>ENOENT</b>).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SIOCSPGRP</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set the process or process
group to send <b>SIGIO</b> or <b>SIGURG</b> signals to when
an asynchronous I/O operation has finished or urgent data is
available. The argument is a pointer to a <i>pid_t</i>. If
the argument is positive, send the signals to that process.
If the argument is negative, send the signals to the process
group with the ID of the absolute value of the argument. The
process may only choose itself or its own process group to
receive signals unless it has the <b>CAP_KILL</b> capability
or an effective UID of 0.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>FIOASYNC</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Change the <b>O_ASYNC</b> flag
to enable or disable asynchronous I/O mode of the socket.
Asynchronous I/O mode means that the <b>SIGIO</b> signal or
the signal set with <b>F_SETSIG</b> is raised when a new I/O
event occurs.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Argument is an
integer boolean flag. (This operation is synonymous with the

<h2>VERSIONS
<a name="VERSIONS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>SO_BINDTODEVICE</b>
was introduced in Linux 2.0.30. <b>SO_PASSCRED</b> is new in
Linux 2.2. The <i>/proc</i> interfaces was introduced in
Linux 2.2. <b>SO_RCVTIMEO</b> and <b>SO_SNDTIMEO</b> are
supported since Linux 2.3.41. Earlier, timeouts were fixed
to a protocol-specific setting, and could not be read or
written.</p>

<h2>NOTES
<a name="NOTES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Linux assumes
that half of the send/receive buffer is used for internal
kernel structures; thus the values in the corresponding
<i>/proc</i> files are twice what can be observed on the
wire.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Linux will only
allow port reuse with the <b>SO_REUSEADDR</b> option when
this option was set both in the previous program that
performed a <b>bind</b>(2) to the port and in the program
that wants to reuse the port. This differs from some
implementations (e.g., FreeBSD) where only the later program
needs to set the <b>SO_REUSEADDR</b> option. Typically this
difference is invisible, since, for example, a server
program is designed to always set this option.</p>

<h2>BUGS
<a name="BUGS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>CONFIG_FILTER</b> socket options <b>SO_ATTACH_FILTER</b>
and <b>SO_DETACH_FILTER</b> are not documented. The
suggested interface to use them is via the libpcap
library.</p>
