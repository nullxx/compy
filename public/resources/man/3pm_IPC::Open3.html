&minus; open a process for reading, writing, and error
handling using open3()</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS

</h2>


<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    $pid = open3(\*CHLD_IN, \*CHLD_OUT, \*CHLD_ERR,
                    'some cmd and args', 'optarg', ...);
    my($wtr, $rdr, $err);

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Extremely
similar to <i>open2()</i>, <i>open3()</i> spawns the given
<tt>$cmd</tt> and connects <small>CHLD_OUT</small> for
reading from the child, <small>CHLD_IN</small> for writing
to the child, and <small>CHLD_ERR</small> for errors. If
<small>CHLD_ERR</small> is false, or the same file
descriptor as <small>CHLD_OUT</small> , then
<small>STDOUT</small> and <small>STDERR</small> of the child
are on the same filehandle (this means that an autovivified
lexical cannot be used for the <small>STDERR</small>
filehandle, see <small>SYNOPSIS</small> ). The
<small>CHLD_IN</small> will have autoflush turned on.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If
<small>CHLD_IN</small> begins with
<tt>&quot;&lt;&amp;&quot;</tt>, then <small>CHLD_IN</small>
will be closed in the parent, and the child will read from
it directly. If <small>CHLD_OUT</small> or
<small>CHLD_ERR</small> begins with
<tt>&quot;&gt;&amp;&quot;</tt>, then the child will send
output directly to that filehandle. In both cases, there
will be a <i>dup</i>(2) instead of a <i>pipe</i>(2)
made.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If either
reader or writer is the null string, this will be replaced
by an autogenerated filehandle. If so, you must pass a valid
lvalue in the parameter slot so it can be overwritten in the
caller, or an exception will be raised.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The filehandles
may also be integers, in which case they are understood as
file descriptors.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>open3()</i>
returns the process <small>ID</small> of the child process.
It doesn&rsquo;t return on failure: it just raises an
exception matching <tt>&quot;/^open3:/&quot;</tt>. However,
<tt>&quot;exec&quot;</tt> failures in the child (such as no
such file or permission denied), are just reported to
<small>CHLD_ERR</small> , as it is not possible to trap
them.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the child
process dies for any reason, the next write to
<small>CHLD_IN</small> is likely to generate a
<small>SIGPIPE</small> in the parent, which is fatal by
default. So you may wish to handle this signal.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note if you
specify <tt>&quot;&minus;&quot;</tt> as the command, in an
analogous fashion to <tt>&quot;open(FOO,
&quot;&minus;|&quot;)&quot;</tt> the child process will just
be the forked Perl process rather than an external command.
This feature isn&rsquo;t yet supported on Win32
platforms.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>open3()</i>
does not wait for and reap the child process after it exits.
Except for short programs where it&rsquo;s acceptable to let
the operating system take care of this, you need to do this
yourself. This is normally as simple as calling
<tt>&quot;waitpid $pid, 0&quot;</tt> when you&rsquo;re done
with the process. Failing to do this can result in an
accumulation of defunct or &quot;zombie&quot; processes. See
&quot;waitpid&quot; in perlfunc for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you try to
read from the child&rsquo;s stdout writer and their stderr
writer, you&rsquo;ll have problems with blocking, which
means you&rsquo;ll want to use <i>select()</i> or the
IO::Select, which means you&rsquo;d best use
<i>sysread()</i> instead of <i>readline()</i> for normal
stuff.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This is very
dangerous, as you may block forever. It assumes it&rsquo;s
going to talk to something like <b>bc</b>, both writing to
it and reading from it. This is presumably safe because you
&quot;know&quot; that commands like <b>bc</b> will read a
line at a time and output a line at a time. Programs like
<b>sort</b> that read their entire input stream first,
however, are quite apt to cause deadlock.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The big problem
with this approach is that if you don&rsquo;t have control
over source code being run in the child process, you
can&rsquo;t control what it does with pipe buffering. Thus
you can&rsquo;t just open a pipe to <tt>&quot;cat
&minus;v&quot;</tt> and continually read and write a line
from it.</p>
