<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">path_resolution
&minus; how a pathname is resolved to a file</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Some UNIX/Linux
system calls have as parameter one or more filenames. A
filename (or pathname) is resolved as follows.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Step 1:
start of the resolution process</b> <br>
If the pathname starts with the '/' character, the starting
lookup directory is the root directory of the calling
process. (A process inherits its root directory from its
parent. Usually this will be the root directory of the file
hierarchy. A process may get a different root directory by
use of the <b>chroot</b>(2) system call. A process may get
an entirely private mount namespace in case it&mdash;or one
of its ancestors&mdash;was started by an invocation of the
<b>clone</b>(2) system call that had the <b>CLONE_NEWNS</b>
flag set.) This handles the '/' part of the pathname.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the pathname
does not start with the '/' character, the starting lookup
directory of the resolution process is the current working
directory of the process. (This is also inherited from the
parent. It can be changed by use of the <b>chdir</b>(2)
system call.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Pathnames
starting with a '/' character are called absolute pathnames.
Pathnames not starting with a '/' are called relative
pathnames.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Step 2: walk
along the path</b> <br>
Set the current lookup directory to the starting lookup
directory. Now, for each nonfinal component of the pathname,
where a component is a substring delimited by '/'
characters, this component is looked up in the current
lookup directory.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the process
does not have search permission on the current lookup
directory, an <b>EACCES</b> error is returned
(&quot;Permission denied&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the
component is not found, an <b>ENOENT</b> error is returned
(&quot;No such file or directory&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the
component is found, but is neither a directory nor a
symbolic link, an <b>ENOTDIR</b> error is returned
(&quot;Not a directory&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the
component is found and is a directory, we set the current
lookup directory to that directory, and go to the next
component.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the
component is found and is a symbolic link (symlink), we
first resolve this symbolic link (with the current lookup
directory as starting lookup directory). Upon error, that
error is returned. If the result is not a directory, an
<b>ENOTDIR</b> error is returned. If the resolution of the
symlink is successful and returns a directory, we set the
current lookup directory to that directory, and go to the
next component. Note that the resolution process here
involves recursion. In order to protect the kernel against
stack overflow, and also to protect against denial of
service, there are limits on the maximum recursion depth,
and on the maximum number of symbolic links followed. An
<b>ELOOP</b> error is returned when the maximum is exceeded
(&quot;Too many levels of symbolic links&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Step 3: find
the final entry</b> <br>
The lookup of the final component of the pathname goes just
like that of all other components, as described in the
previous step, with two differences: (i) the final component
need not be a directory (at least as far as the path
resolution process is concerned&mdash;it may have to be a
directory, or a nondirectory, because of the requirements of
the specific system call), and (ii) it is not necessarily an
error if the component is not found&mdash;maybe we are just
creating it. The details on the treatment of the final entry
are described in the manual pages of the specific system
calls.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>. and ..</b>
<br>
By convention, every directory has the entries &quot;.&quot;
and &quot;..&quot;, which refer to the directory itself and
to its parent directory, respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The path
resolution process will assume that these entries have their
conventional meanings, regardless of whether they are
actually present in the physical file system.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">One cannot walk
down past the root: &quot;/..&quot; is the same as
&quot;/&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Mount
points</b> <br>
After a &quot;mount dev path&quot; command, the pathname
&quot;path&quot; refers to the root of the file system
hierarchy on the device &quot;dev&quot;, and no longer to
whatever it referred to earlier.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">One can walk
out of a mounted file system: &quot;path/..&quot; refers to
the parent directory of &quot;path&quot;, outside of the
file system hierarchy on &quot;dev&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Trailing
slashes</b> <br>
If a pathname ends in a '/', that forces resolution of the
preceding component as in Step 2: it has to exist and
resolve to a directory. Otherwise a trailing '/' is ignored.
(Or, equivalently, a pathname with a trailing '/' is
equivalent to the pathname obtained by appending '.' to
it.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Final
symlink</b> <br>
If the last component of a pathname is a symbolic link, then
it depends on the system call whether the file referred to
will be the symbolic link or the result of path resolution
on its contents. For example, the system call
<b>lstat</b>(2) will operate on the symlink, while
<b>stat</b>(2) operates on the file pointed to by the
symlink.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Length
limit</b> <br>
There is a maximum length for pathnames. If the pathname (or
some intermediate pathname obtained while resolving symbolic
links) is too long, an <b>ENAMETOOLONG</b> error is returned
(&quot;Filename too long&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Empty
pathname</b> <br>
In the original UNIX, the empty pathname referred to the
current directory. Nowadays POSIX decrees that an empty
pathname must not be resolved successfully. Linux returns
<b>ENOENT</b> in this case.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Permissions</b>
<br>
The permission bits of a file consist of three groups of
three bits, cf. <b>chmod</b>(1) and <b>stat</b>(2). The
first group of three is used when the effective user ID of
the calling process equals the owner ID of the file. The
second group of three is used when the group ID of the file
either equals the effective group ID of the calling process,
or is one of the supplementary group IDs of the calling
process (as set by <b>setgroups</b>(2)). When neither holds,
the third group is used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Of the three
bits used, the first bit determines read permission, the
second write permission, and the last execute permission in
case of ordinary files, or search permission in case of
directories.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Linux uses the
fsuid instead of the effective user ID in permission checks.
Ordinarily the fsuid will equal the effective user ID, but
the fsuid can be changed by the system call
<b>setfsuid</b>(2).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">(Here
&quot;fsuid&quot; stands for something like &quot;file
system user ID&quot;. The concept was required for the
implementation of a user space NFS server at a time when
processes could send a signal to a process with the same
effective user ID. It is obsolete now. Nobody should use
<b>setfsuid</b>(2).)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Similarly,
Linux uses the fsgid (&quot;file system group ID&quot;)
instead of the effective group ID. See
<b>setfsgid</b>(2).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Bypassing
permission checks: superuser and capabilities</b> <br>
On a traditional UNIX system, the superuser (<i>root</i>,
user ID 0) is all-powerful, and bypasses all permissions
restrictions when accessing files.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On Linux,
superuser privileges are divided into capabilities (see
<b>capabilities</b>(7)). Two capabilities are relevant for
file permissions checks: <b>CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE</b> and
<b>CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH</b>. (A process has these
capabilities if its fsuid is 0.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE</b> capability overrides all permission
checking, but grants execute permission only when at least
one of the file&rsquo;s three execute permission bits is
set.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH</b> capability grants read and search
permission on directories, and read permission on ordinary
files.</p>
