<p style="margin-left:17%;">&lt;http://www.cpan.org/misc/olddoc/FMTEYEWTK.tgz&gt;
(not a man-page but still useful, a collection of various
essays on Perl techniques)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A crude table
of contents for the Perl manpage set is found in
perltoc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>How can I
use Perl interactively?</b> <br>
The typical approach uses the Perl debugger, described in
the <i>perldebug</i>(1) manpage, on an &quot;empty&quot;
program, like this:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    perl &minus;de 42</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Now just type
in any legal Perl code, and it will be immediately
evaluated. You can also examine the symbol table, get stack
backtraces, check variable values, set breakpoints, and
other operations typically found in symbolic debuggers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can also
use Devel::REPL which is an interactive shell for Perl,
commonly known as a <small>REPL</small> &minus; Read,
Evaluate, Print, Loop. It provides various handy
features.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>How do I
find which modules are installed on my system?</b> <br>
From the command line, you can use the
<tt>&quot;cpan&quot;</tt> command&rsquo;s
<tt>&quot;&minus;l&quot;</tt> switch:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    $ cpan &minus;l</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can also
use <tt>&quot;cpan&quot;</tt>&rsquo;s
<tt>&quot;&minus;a&quot;</tt> switch to create an autobundle
file that <tt>&quot;CPAN.pm&quot;</tt> understands and can
use to re-install every module:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    $ cpan &minus;a</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Inside a Perl
program, you can use the ExtUtils::Installed module to show
all installed distributions, although it can take awhile to
do its magic. The standard library which comes with Perl
just shows up as &quot;Perl&quot; (although you can get
those with Module::CoreList).</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    use ExtUtils::Installed;
    my $inst    = ExtUtils::Installed&minus;&gt;new();
    my @modules = $inst&minus;&gt;modules();</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you want a
list of all of the Perl module filenames, you can use
File::Find::Rule:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    use File::Find::Rule;
    my @files = File::Find::Rule&minus;&gt;
        extras({follow =&gt; 1})&minus;&gt;
        file()&minus;&gt;
        name( '*.pm' )&minus;&gt;
        in( @INC )
        ;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you do not
have that module, you can do the same thing with File::Find
which is part of the standard library:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    use File::Find;
    my @files;
    find(
        {
        wanted =&gt; sub {
            push @files, $File::Find::fullname
            if &minus;f $File::Find::fullname &amp;&amp; /\.pm$/
        },
        follow =&gt; 1,
        follow_skip =&gt; 2,
        },
        @INC
    );
    print join &quot;\n&quot;, @files;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you simply
need to check quickly to see if a module is available, you
can check for its documentation. If you can read the
documentation the module is most likely installed. If you
cannot read the documentation, the module might not have any
(in rare cases):</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    $ perldoc Module::Name</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can also
try to include the module in a one-liner to see if perl
finds it:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    $ perl &minus;MModule::Name &minus;e1</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">(If you
don&rsquo;t receive a &quot;Can&rsquo;t locate ... in
<tt>@INC</tt>&quot; error message, then Perl found the
module name you asked for.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>How do I
debug my Perl programs?</b> <br>
(contributed by brian d foy)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Before you do
anything else, you can help yourself by ensuring that you
let Perl tell you about problem areas in your code. By
turning on warnings and strictures, you can head off many
problems before they get too big. You can find out more
about these in strict and warnings.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    #!/usr/bin/perl
    use strict;
    use warnings;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Beyond that,
the simplest debugger is the <tt>&quot;print&quot;</tt>
function. Use it to look at values as you run your
program:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    print STDERR &quot;The value is [$value]\n&quot;;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
Data::Dumper module can pretty-print Perl data
structures:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    use Data::Dumper qw( Dumper );
    print STDERR &quot;The hash is &quot; . Dumper( \%hash ) . &quot;\n&quot;;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Perl comes with
an interactive debugger, which you can start with the
<tt>&quot;&minus;d&quot;</tt> switch. It&rsquo;s fully
explained in perldebug.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you&rsquo;d
like a graphical user interface and you have Tk, you can use
<tt>&quot;ptkdb&quot;</tt>. It&rsquo;s on
<small>CPAN</small> and available for free.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you need
something much more sophisticated and controllable, Leon
Brocard&rsquo;s Devel::ebug (which you can call with the
<tt>&quot;&minus;D&quot;</tt> switch as
<tt>&quot;&minus;Debug&quot;</tt>) gives you the
programmatic hooks into everything you need to write your
own (without too much pain and suffering).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can also
use a commercial debugger such as Affrus (Mac
<small>OS</small> X), Komodo from Activestate (Windows and
Mac <small>OS</small> X), or <small>EPIC</small> (most
platforms).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>How do I
profile my Perl programs?</b> <br>
(contributed by brian d foy, updated Fri Jul 25 12:22:26
<small>PDT</small> 2008)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<tt>&quot;Devel&quot;</tt> namespace has several modules
which you can use to profile your Perl programs.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
Devel::NYTProf (New York Times Profiler) does both statement
and subroutine profiling. It&rsquo;s available from
<small>CPAN</small> and you also invoke it with the
<tt>&quot;&minus;d&quot;</tt> switch:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    perl &minus;d:NYTProf some_perl.pl</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It creates a
database of the profile information that you can turn into
reports. The <tt>&quot;nytprofhtml&quot;</tt> command turns
the data into an <small>HTML</small> report similar to the
Devel::Cover report:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    nytprofhtml</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You might also
be interested in using the Benchmark to measure and compare
code snippets.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can read
more about profiling in <i>Programming Perl</i>, chapter 20,
or <i>Mastering Perl</i>, chapter 5.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">perldebguts
documents creating a custom debugger if you need to create a
special sort of profiler. brian d foy describes the process
in <i>The Perl Journal</i>, &quot;Creating a Perl
Debugger&quot;, &lt;http://www.ddj.com/184404522&gt; , and
&quot;Profiling in Perl&quot;
&lt;http://www.ddj.com/184404580&gt; .</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Perl.com has
two interesting articles on profiling: &quot;Profiling
Perl&quot;, by Simon Cozens,
&lt;http://www.perl.com/lpt/a/850&gt; and &quot;Debugging
and Profiling mod_perl Applications&quot;, by Frank Wiles,
&lt;http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2006/02/09/debug_mod_perl.html&gt;
.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Randal L.
Schwartz writes about profiling in &quot;Speeding up Your
Perl Programs&quot; for <i>Unix Review</i>,
&lt;http://www.stonehenge.com/merlyn/UnixReview/col49.html&gt;
, and &quot;Profiling in Template Toolkit via
Overriding&quot; for <i>Linux Magazine</i>,
&lt;http://www.stonehenge.com/merlyn/LinuxMag/col75.html&gt;
.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>How do I
cross-reference my Perl programs?</b> <br>
The B::Xref module can be used to generate cross-reference
reports for Perl programs.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    perl &minus;MO=Xref[,OPTIONS] scriptname.plx</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Is there a
pretty-printer (formatter) for Perl?</b> <br>
Perl::Tidy comes with a perl script perltidy which indents
and reformats Perl scripts to make them easier to read by
trying to follow the rules of the perlstyle. If you write
Perl, or spend much time reading Perl, you will probably
find it useful.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Of course, if
you simply follow the guidelines in perlstyle, you
shouldn&rsquo;t need to reformat. The habit of formatting
your code as you write it will help prevent bugs. Your
editor can and should help you with this. The perl-mode or
newer cperl-mode for emacs can provide remarkable amounts of
help with most (but not all) code, and even less
programmable editors can provide significant assistance. Tom
Christiansen and many other <small>VI</small> users swear by
the following settings in vi and its clones:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    set ai sw=4
    map! ^O {^M}^[O^T</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Put that in
your <i>.exrc</i> file (replacing the caret characters with
control characters) and away you go. In insert mode, ^T is
for indenting, ^D is for undenting, and ^O is for
blockdenting--as it were. A more complete example, with
comments, can be found at
&lt;http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/TOMC/scripts/toms.exrc.gz&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Is there an
<small>IDE</small> or Windows Perl Editor?</b> <br>
Perl programs are just plain text, so any editor will
do.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you&rsquo;re
on Unix, you already have an IDE--Unix itself. The Unix
philosophy is the philosophy of several small tools that
each do one thing and do it well. It&rsquo;s like a
carpenter&rsquo;s toolbox.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you want an
<small>IDE</small> , check the following (in alphabetical

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For editors: if
you&rsquo;re on Unix you probably have vi or a vi clone
already, and possibly an emacs too, so you may not need to
download anything. In any emacs the cperl-mode (M&minus;x
cperl-mode) gives you perhaps the best available Perl
editing mode in any editor.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you are
using Windows, you can use any editor that lets you work
with plain text, such as NotePad or WordPad. Word
processors, such as Microsoft Word or WordPerfect, typically
do not work since they insert all sorts of behind-the-scenes
information, although some allow you to save files as
&quot;Text Only&quot;. You can also download text editors
designed specifically for programming, such as Textpad (
&lt;http://www.textpad.com/&gt; ) and UltraEdit (
&lt;http://www.ultraedit.com/&gt; ), among others.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you are
using MacOS, the same concerns apply. MacPerl (for Classic
environments) comes with a simple editor. Popular external
editors are BBEdit ( &lt;http://www.bbedit.com/&gt; ) or
Alpha ( &lt;http://www.his.com/~jguyer/Alpha/Alpha8.html&gt;
). MacOS X users can use Unix editors as well. <small><br>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Gtk and Gtk2</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">These are Perl bindings for the
Gtk toolkit ( &lt;http://www.gtk.org&gt; ). The interface
changed significantly between versions 1 and 2 so they have
separate Perl modules. It runs under Unix, Win32 and Mac
<small>OS</small> X (currently it requires an X server on
Mac <small>OS</small> , but a &rsquo;native&rsquo; port is
underway), and the widgets look the same on every platform:
i.e., they don&rsquo;t match the native widgets. As with Wx,
the Perl bindings follow the C <small>API</small> closely,
and the documentation requires you to read the C
documentation to understand it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Win32::GUI</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This provides access to most of
the Win32 <small>GUI</small> widgets from Perl. Obviously,
it only runs under Win32, and uses native widgets. The Perl
interface doesn&rsquo;t really follow the C interface:
it&rsquo;s been made more Perlish, and the documentation is

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>How can I
make my Perl program run faster?</b> <br>
The best way to do this is to come up with a better
algorithm. This can often make a dramatic difference. Jon
Bentley&rsquo;s book <i>Programming Pearls</i> (that&rsquo;s
not a misspelling!) has some good tips on optimization, too.
Advice on benchmarking boils down to: benchmark and profile
to make sure you&rsquo;re optimizing the right part, look
for better algorithms instead of microtuning your code, and
when all else fails consider just buying faster hardware.
You will probably want to read the answer to the earlier
question &quot;How do I profile my Perl programs?&quot; if
you haven&rsquo;t done so already.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A different
approach is to autoload seldom-used Perl code. See the
AutoSplit and AutoLoader modules in the standard
distribution for that. Or you could locate the bottleneck
and think about writing just that part in C, the way we used
to take bottlenecks in C code and write them in assembler.
Similar to rewriting in C, modules that have critical
sections can be written in C (for instance, the
<small>PDL</small> module from <small>CPAN</small> ).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you&rsquo;re
currently linking your perl executable to a shared
<i>libc.so</i>, you can often gain a 10&minus;25%
performance benefit by rebuilding it to link with a static
libc.a instead. This will make a bigger perl executable, but
your Perl programs (and programmers) may thank you for it.
See the <i><small>INSTALL</small></i> file in the source
distribution for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The undump
program was an ancient attempt to speed up Perl program by
storing the already-compiled form to disk. This is no longer
a viable option, as it only worked on a few architectures,
and wasn&rsquo;t a good solution anyway.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>How can I
make my Perl program take less memory?</b> <br>
When it comes to time-space tradeoffs, Perl nearly always
prefers to throw memory at a problem. Scalars in Perl use
more memory than strings in C, arrays take more than that,
and hashes use even more. While there&rsquo;s still a lot to
be done, recent releases have been addressing these issues.
For example, as of 5.004, duplicate hash keys are shared
amongst all hashes using them, so require no
reallocation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In some cases,
using <i>substr()</i> or <i>vec()</i> to simulate arrays can
be highly beneficial. For example, an array of a thousand
booleans will take at least 20,000 bytes of space, but it
can be turned into one 125&minus;byte bit vector--a
considerable memory savings. The standard Tie::SubstrHash
module can also help for certain types of data structure. If
you&rsquo;re working with specialist data structures
(matrices, for instance) modules that implement these in C
may use less memory than equivalent Perl modules.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Another thing
to try is learning whether your Perl was compiled with the
system malloc or with Perl&rsquo;s builtin malloc. Whichever
one it is, try using the other one and see whether this
makes a difference. Information about malloc is in the
<i><small>INSTALL</small></i> file in the source
distribution. You can find out whether you are using
perl&rsquo;s malloc by typing <tt>&quot;perl
&minus;V:usemymalloc&quot;</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Of course, the
best way to save memory is to not do anything to waste it in
the first place. Good programming practices can go a long
way toward this: <br>
Don&rsquo;t slurp!</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Don&rsquo;t read an entire file
into memory if you can process it line by line. Or more
concretely, use a loop like this:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    #
    # Good Idea
    #
    while (my $line = &lt;$file_handle&gt;) {
       # ...
    }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">instead of
this:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    #
    # Bad Idea
    #
    my @data = &lt;$file_handle&gt;;
    foreach (@data) {
        # ...
    }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">When the files
you&rsquo;re processing are small, it doesn&rsquo;t much
matter which way you do it, but it makes a huge difference
when they start getting larger.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Use map and grep
selectively</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Remember that both map and grep
expect a <small>LIST</small> argument, so doing this:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">        @wanted = grep {/pattern/} &lt;$file_handle&gt;;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">will cause the
entire file to be slurped. For large files, it&rsquo;s
better to loop:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">        while (&lt;$file_handle&gt;) {
                push(@wanted, $_) if /pattern/;
        }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%;">Avoid unnecessary quotes and
stringification</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Don&rsquo;t quote large strings
unless absolutely necessary:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">        my $copy = &quot;$large_string&quot;;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">makes 2 copies
of <tt>$large_string</tt> (one for <tt>$copy</tt> and
another for the quotes), whereas</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">        my $copy = $large_string;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">only makes one
copy.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Ditto for
stringifying large arrays:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    {
    local $, = &quot;\n&quot;;
    print @big_array;
    }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">is much more
memory-efficient than either</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    print join &quot;\n&quot;, @big_array;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">or</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    {
    local $&quot; = &quot;\n&quot;;
    print &quot;@big_array&quot;;
    }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%;">Pass by reference</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Pass arrays and hashes by
reference, not by value. For one thing, it&rsquo;s the only
way to pass multiple lists or hashes (or both) in a single
call/return. It also avoids creating a copy of all the
contents. This requires some judgement, however, because any
changes will be propagated back to the original data. If you
really want to mangle (er, modify) a copy, you&rsquo;ll have
to sacrifice the memory needed to make one.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Tie large variables to disk</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">For &quot;big&quot; data stores
(i.e. ones that exceed available memory) consider using one
of the <small>DB</small> modules to store it on disk instead
of in <small>RAM</small> . This will incur a penalty in
access time, but that&rsquo;s probably better than causing
your hard disk to thrash due to massive swapping.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Is it safe
to return a reference to local or lexical data?</b> <br>
Yes. Perl&rsquo;s garbage collection system takes care of
this so everything works out right.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    sub makeone {
        my @a = ( 1 .. 10 );
        return \@a;
    }
    for ( 1 .. 10 ) {
        push @many, makeone();
    }
    print $many[4][5], &quot;\n&quot;;
    print &quot;@many\n&quot;;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>How can I
free an array or hash so my program shrinks?</b> <br>
(contributed by Michael Carman)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You usually
can&rsquo;t. Memory allocated to lexicals (i.e. <i>my()</i>
variables) cannot be reclaimed or reused even if they go out
of scope. It is reserved in case the variables come back
into scope. Memory allocated to global variables can be
reused (within your program) by using <i>undef()</i> and/or
<i>delete()</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On most
operating systems, memory allocated to a program can never
be returned to the system. That&rsquo;s why long-running
programs sometimes re&minus; exec themselves. Some operating
systems (notably, systems that use <i>mmap</i>(2) for
allocating large chunks of memory) can reclaim memory that
is no longer used, but on such systems, perl must be
configured and compiled to use the <small>OS</small>
&rsquo;s malloc, not perl&rsquo;s.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In general,
memory allocation and de-allocation isn&rsquo;t something
you can or should be worrying about much in Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>How can I
make my <small>CGI</small> script more efficient?</b> <br>
Beyond the normal measures described to make general Perl
programs faster or smaller, a <small>CGI</small> program has
additional issues. It may be run several times per second.
Given that each time it runs it will need to be re-compiled
and will often allocate a megabyte or more of system memory,
this can be a killer. Compiling into C <b>isn&rsquo;t going
to help you</b> because the process start-up overhead is
where the bottleneck is.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There are three
popular ways to avoid this overhead. One solution involves
running the Apache <small>HTTP</small> server (available
from &lt;http://www.apache.org/&gt; ) with either of the
mod_perl or mod_fastcgi plugin modules.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">With mod_perl
and the Apache::Registry module (distributed with mod_perl),
httpd will run with an embedded Perl interpreter which
pre-compiles your script and then executes it within the
same address space without forking. The Apache extension
also gives Perl access to the internal server
<small>API</small> , so modules written in Perl can do just
about anything a module written in C can. For more on
mod_perl, see &lt;http://perl.apache.org/&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">With the
<small>FCGI</small> module (from <small>CPAN</small> ) and
the mod_fastcgi module (available from
&lt;http://www.fastcgi.com/&gt; ) each of your Perl programs
becomes a permanent <small>CGI</small> daemon process.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Finally, Plack
is a Perl module and toolkit that contains
<small>PSGI</small> middleware, helpers and adapters to web
servers, allowing you to easily deploy scripts which can
continue running, and provides flexibility with regards to
which web server you use. It can allow existing
<small>CGI</small> scripts to enjoy this flexibility and
performance with minimal changes, or can be used along with
modern Perl web frameworks to make writing and deploying web
services with Perl a breeze.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These solutions
can have far-reaching effects on your system and on the way
you write your <small>CGI</small> programs, so investigate
them with care.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>How can I
hide the source for my Perl program?</b> <br>
Delete it. :&minus;) Seriously, there are a number of
(mostly unsatisfactory) solutions with varying levels of
&quot;security&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">First of all,
however, you <i>can&rsquo;t</i> take away read permission,
because the source code has to be readable in order to be
compiled and interpreted. (That doesn&rsquo;t mean that a
<small>CGI</small> script&rsquo;s source is readable by
people on the web, though--only by people with access to the
filesystem.) So you have to leave the permissions at the
socially friendly 0755 level.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Some people
regard this as a security problem. If your program does
insecure things and relies on people not knowing how to
exploit those insecurities, it is not secure. It is often
possible for someone to determine the insecure things and
exploit them without viewing the source. Security through
obscurity, the name for hiding your bugs instead of fixing
them, is little security indeed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can try
using encryption via source filters (Starting from Perl 5.8
the Filter::Simple and Filter::Util::Call modules are
included in the standard distribution), but any decent
programmer will be able to decrypt it. You can try using the
byte code compiler and interpreter described later in
perlfaq3, but the curious might still be able to de-compile
it. You can try using the native-code compiler described
later, but crackers might be able to disassemble it. These
pose varying degrees of difficulty to people wanting to get
at your code, but none can definitively conceal it (true of
every language, not just Perl).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is very easy
to recover the source of Perl programs. You simply feed the
program to the perl interpreter and use the modules in the
B:: hierarchy. The B::Deparse module should be able to
defeat most attempts to hide source. Again, this is not
unique to Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you&rsquo;re
concerned about people profiting from your code, then the
bottom line is that nothing but a restrictive license will
give you legal security. License your software and pepper it
with threatening statements like &quot;This is unpublished
proprietary software of <small>XYZ</small> Corp. Your access
to it does not give you permission to use it blah blah
blah.&quot; We are not lawyers, of course, so you should see
a lawyer if you want to be sure your license&rsquo;s wording
will stand up in court.</p>

Yes. Read perlrun for more information. Some examples

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Why
don&rsquo;t Perl one-liners work on my DOS/Mac/VMS
system?</b> <br>
The problem is usually that the command interpreters on
those systems have rather different ideas about quoting than
the Unix shells under which the one-liners were created. On
some systems, you may have to change single-quotes to double
ones, which you must <i><small>NOT</small></i> do on Unix or
Plan9 systems. You might also have to change a single % to a
%%.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For
example:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    # Unix (including Mac OS X)
    perl &minus;e 'print &quot;Hello world\n&quot;'
    # DOS, etc.
    perl &minus;e &quot;print \&quot;Hello world\n\&quot;&quot;
    # Mac Classic
    print &quot;Hello world\n&quot;
     (then Run &quot;Myscript&quot; or Shift&minus;Command&minus;R)
    # MPW
    perl &minus;e 'print &quot;Hello world\n&quot;'
    # VMS
    perl &minus;e &quot;print &quot;&quot;Hello world\n&quot;&quot;&quot;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The problem is
that none of these examples are reliable: they depend on the
command interpreter. Under Unix, the first two often work.
Under <small>DOS</small> , it&rsquo;s entirely possible that
neither works. If 4DOS was the command shell, you&rsquo;d
probably have better luck like this:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  perl &minus;e &quot;print &lt;Ctrl&minus;x&gt;&quot;Hello world\n&lt;Ctrl&minus;x&gt;&quot;&quot;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Under the Mac,
it depends which environment you are using. The MacPerl
shell, or <small>MPW</small> , is much like Unix shells in
its support for several quoting variants, except that it
makes free use of the Mac&rsquo;s non-ASCII characters as
control characters.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Using
<i>qq()</i>, q(), and <i>qx()</i>, instead of &quot;double
quotes&quot;, &rsquo;single quotes&rsquo;, and
&lsquo;backticks&lsquo;, may make one-liners easier to
write.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There is no
general solution to all of this. It is a mess.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Where can I
learn about <small>CGI</small> or Web programming in
Perl?</b> <br>
For modules, get the <small>CGI</small> or
<small>LWP</small> modules from <small>CPAN</small> . For
textbooks, see the two especially dedicated to web stuff in
the question on books. For problems and questions related to
the web, like &quot;Why do I get 500 Errors&quot; or
&quot;Why doesn&rsquo;t it run from the browser right when
it runs fine on the command line&quot;, see the
troubleshooting guides and references in perlfaq9 or in the
<small>CGI</small> MetaFAQ:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    L&lt;http://www.perl.org/CGI_MetaFAQ.html&gt;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Looking in to
Plack and modern Perl web frameworks is highly recommended,
though; web programming in Perl has evolved a long way from
the old days of simple <small>CGI</small> scripts.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Where can I
learn about object-oriented Perl programming?</b> <br>
A good place to start is perltoot, and you can use perlobj,
perlboot, perltoot, perltooc, and perlbot for reference.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A good book on
<small>OO</small> on Perl is the &quot;Object-Oriented
Perl&quot; by Damian Conway from Manning Publications, or
&quot;Intermediate Perl&quot; by Randal Schwartz, brian d
foy, and Tom Phoenix from O&rsquo;Reilly Media.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Where can I
learn about linking C with Perl?</b> <br>
If you want to call C from Perl, start with perlxstut,
moving on to perlxs, xsubpp, and perlguts. If you want to
call Perl from C, then read perlembed, perlcall, and
perlguts. Don&rsquo;t forget that you can learn a lot from
looking at how the authors of existing extension modules
wrote their code and solved their problems.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You might not
need all the power of <small>XS</small> . The Inline::C
module lets you put C code directly in your Perl source. It
handles all the magic to make it work. You still have to
learn at least some of the perl <small>API</small> but you
won&rsquo;t have to deal with the complexity of the
<small>XS</small> support files.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>I&rsquo;ve
read perlembed, perlguts, etc., but I can&rsquo;t embed perl
in my C program; what am I doing wrong?</b> <br>
Download the ExtUtils::Embed kit from <small>CPAN</small>
and run &lsquo;make test&rsquo;. If the tests pass, read the
pods again and again and again. If they fail, see perlbug
and send a bug report with the output of <tt>&quot;make test
TEST_VERBOSE=1&quot;</tt> along with <tt>&quot;perl
&minus;V&quot;</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>When I tried
to run my script, I got this message. What does it mean?</b>
<br>
A complete list of Perl&rsquo;s error messages and warnings
with explanatory text can be found in perldiag. You can also
use the splain program (distributed with Perl) to explain
the error messages:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    perl program 2&gt;diag.out
    splain [&minus;v] [&minus;p] diag.out</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">or change your
program to explain the messages for you:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    use diagnostics;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">or</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    use diagnostics &minus;verbose;</pre>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
ExtUtils::MakeMaker module, better known simply as
&quot;MakeMaker&quot;, turns a Perl script, typically called
<tt>&quot;Makefile.PL&quot;</tt>, into a Makefile. The Unix
