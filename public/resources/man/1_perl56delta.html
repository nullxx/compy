<h2>NAME
<a name="NAME"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">perl56delta
&minus; what&rsquo;s new for perl v5.6.0</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This document
describes differences between the 5.005 release and the
5.6.0 release.</p>

<h2>Core Enhancements
<a name="Core Enhancements"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Interpreter
cloning, threads, and concurrency</b> <br>
Perl 5.6.0 introduces the beginnings of support for running
multiple interpreters concurrently in different threads. In
conjunction with the <i>perl_clone()</i> <small>API</small>
call, which can be used to selectively duplicate the state
of any given interpreter, it is possible to compile a piece
of code once in an interpreter, clone that interpreter one
or more times, and run all the resulting interpreters in
distinct threads.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On the Windows
platform, this feature is used to emulate <i>fork()</i> at
the interpreter level. See perlfork for details about
that.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This feature is
still in evolution. It is eventually meant to be used to
selectively clone a subroutine and data reachable from that
subroutine in a separate interpreter and run the cloned
subroutine in a separate thread. Since there is no shared
data between the interpreters, little or no locking will be
needed (unless parts of the symbol table are explicitly
shared). This is obviously intended to be an easy-to-use
replacement for the existing threads support.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Support for
cloning interpreters and interpreter concurrency can be
enabled using the &minus;Dusethreads Configure option (see
win32/Makefile for how to enable it on Windows.) The
resulting perl executable will be functionally identical to
one that was built with &minus;Dmultiplicity, but the
<i>perl_clone()</i> <small>API</small> call will only be
available in the former.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;Dusethreads
enables the cpp macro <small>USE_ITHREADS</small> by
default, which in turn enables Perl source code changes that
provide a clear separation between the op tree and the data
it operates with. The former is immutable, and can therefore
be shared between an interpreter and all of its clones,
while the latter is considered local to each interpreter,
and is therefore copied for each clone.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
building Perl with the &minus;Dusemultiplicity Configure
option is adequate if you wish to run multiple
<b>independent</b> interpreters concurrently in different
threads. &minus;Dusethreads only provides the additional
functionality of the <i>perl_clone()</i> <small>API</small>
call and other support for running <b>cloned</b>
interpreters concurrently.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    NOTE: This is an experimental feature.  Implementation details are
    subject to change.</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Lexically
scoped warning categories</b> <br>
You can now control the granularity of warnings emitted by
perl at a finer level using the <tt>&quot;use
warnings&quot;</tt> pragma. warnings and perllexwarn have
copious documentation on this feature.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Unicode and
<small>UTF&minus;8</small> support</b> <br>
Perl now uses <small>UTF&minus;8</small> as its internal
representation for character strings. The
<tt>&quot;utf8&quot;</tt> and <tt>&quot;bytes&quot;</tt>
pragmas are used to control this support in the current
lexical scope. See perlunicode, utf8 and bytes for more
information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This feature is
expected to evolve quickly to support some form of I/O
disciplines that can be used to specify the kind of input
and output data (bytes or characters). Until that happens,
additional modules from <small>CPAN</small> will be needed
to complete the toolkit for dealing with Unicode.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    NOTE: This should be considered an experimental feature.  Implementation
    details are subject to change.</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Support for
interpolating named characters</b> <br>
The new <tt>&quot;\N&quot;</tt> escape interpolates named
characters within strings. For example, <tt>&quot;Hi!
\N{WHITE SMILING FACE}&quot;</tt> evaluates to a string with
a unicode smiley face at the end.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&quot;our&quot;
declarations</b> <br>
An &quot;our&quot; declaration introduces a value that can
be best understood as a lexically scoped symbolic alias to a
global variable in the package that was current where the
variable was declared. This is mostly useful as an
alternative to the <tt>&quot;vars&quot;</tt> pragma, but
also provides the opportunity to introduce typing and other
attributes for such variables. See &quot;our&quot; in
perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Support for
strings represented as a vector of ordinals</b> <br>
Literals of the form <tt>&quot;v1.2.3.4&quot;</tt> are now
parsed as a string composed of characters with the specified
ordinals. This is an alternative, more readable way to
construct (possibly unicode) strings instead of
interpolating characters, as in
<tt>&quot;\x{1}\x{2}\x{3}\x{4}&quot;</tt>. The leading
<tt>&quot;v&quot;</tt> may be omitted if there are more than
two ordinals, so <tt>1.2.3</tt> is parsed the same as
<tt>&quot;v1.2.3&quot;</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Strings written
in this form are also useful to represent version
&quot;numbers&quot;. It is easy to compare such version
&quot;numbers&quot; (which are really just plain strings)
using any of the usual string comparison operators
<tt>&quot;eq&quot;</tt>, <tt>&quot;ne&quot;</tt>,
<tt>&quot;lt&quot;</tt>, <tt>&quot;gt&quot;</tt>, etc., or
perform bitwise string operations on them using
<tt>&quot;|&quot;</tt>, <tt>&quot;&amp;&quot;</tt>, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In conjunction
with the new <tt>$^V</tt> magic variable (which contains the
perl version as a string), such literals can be used as a
readable way to check if you&rsquo;re running a particular
version of Perl:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    # this will parse in older versions of Perl also
    if ($^V and $^V gt v5.6.0) {
        # new features supported
    }</pre>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;require&quot;
and <tt>&quot;use&quot;</tt> also have some special magic to
support such literals, but this particular usage should be
avoided because it leads to misleading error messages under
versions of Perl which don&rsquo;t support vector strings.
Using a true version number will ensure correct behavior in
all versions of Perl:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    require 5.006;    # run time check for v5.6
    use 5.006_001;    # compile time check for v5.6.1</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Also,
<tt>&quot;sprintf&quot;</tt> and <tt>&quot;printf&quot;</tt>
support the Perl-specific format flag <tt>%v</tt> to print
ordinals of characters in arbitrary strings:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    printf &quot;v%vd&quot;, $^V;         # prints current version, such as &quot;v5.5.650&quot;
    printf &quot;%*vX&quot;, &quot;:&quot;, $addr;  # formats IPv6 address
    printf &quot;%*vb&quot;, &quot; &quot;, $bits;  # displays bitstring</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">See
&quot;Scalar value constructors&quot; in perldata for
additional information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Improved
Perl version numbering system</b> <br>
Beginning with Perl version 5.6.0, the version number
convention has been changed to a &quot;dotted integer&quot;
scheme that is more commonly found in open source
projects.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Maintenance
versions of v5.6.0 will be released as v5.6.1, v5.6.2 etc.
The next development series following v5.6.0 will be
numbered v5.7.x, beginning with v5.7.0, and the next major
production release following v5.6.0 will be v5.8.0.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The English
module now sets <tt>$PERL_VERSION</tt> to $^V (a string
value) rather than <tt>$]</tt> (a numeric value). (This is a
potential incompatibility. Send us a report via perlbug if
you are affected by this.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The v1.2.3
syntax is also now legal in Perl. See &quot;Support for
strings represented as a vector of ordinals&quot; for more
on that.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To cope with
the new versioning system&rsquo;s use of at least three
significant digits for each version component, the method
used for incrementing the subversion number has also changed
slightly. We assume that versions older than v5.6.0 have
been incrementing the subversion component in multiples of
10. Versions after v5.6.0 will increment them by 1. Thus,
using the new notation, 5.005_03 is the &quot;same&quot; as
v5.5.30, and the first maintenance version following v5.6.0
will be v5.6.1 (which should be read as being equivalent to
a floating point value of 5.006_001 in the older format,
stored in <tt>$]</tt>).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>New syntax
for declaring subroutine attributes</b> <br>
Formerly, if you wanted to mark a subroutine as being a
method call or as requiring an automatic <i>lock()</i> when
it is entered, you had to declare that with a <tt>&quot;use
attrs&quot;</tt> pragma in the body of the subroutine. That
can now be accomplished with declaration syntax, like
this:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    sub mymethod : locked method;
    ...
    sub mymethod : locked method {
        ...
    }
    sub othermethod :locked :method;
    ...
    sub othermethod :locked :method {
        ...
    }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">(Note how only
the first <tt>&quot;:&quot;</tt> is mandatory, and
whitespace surrounding the <tt>&quot;:&quot;</tt> is
optional.)</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>AutoSplit.pm</i>
and <i>SelfLoader.pm</i> have been updated to keep the
attributes with the stubs they provide. See attributes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>File and
directory handles can be autovivified</b> <br>
Similar to how constructs such as
<tt>&quot;$x&minus;&gt;[0]&quot;</tt> autovivify a
reference, handle constructors (<i>open()</i>,
<i>opendir()</i>, <i>pipe()</i>, <i>socketpair()</i>,
<i>sysopen()</i>, <i>socket()</i>, and <i>accept()</i>) now
autovivify a file or directory handle if the handle passed
to them is an uninitialized scalar variable. This allows the
constructs such as <tt>&quot;open(my $fh, ...)&quot;</tt>
and <tt>&quot;open(local $fh,...)&quot;</tt> to be used to
create filehandles that will conveniently be closed
automatically when the scope ends, provided there are no
other references to them. This largely eliminates the need
for typeglobs when opening filehandles that must be passed
around, as in the following example:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    sub myopen {
        open my $fh, &quot;@_&quot;
             or die &quot;Can't open '@_': $!&quot;;
        return $fh;
    }
    {
        my $f = myopen(&quot;&lt;/etc/motd&quot;);
        print &lt;$f&gt;;
        # $f implicitly closed here
    }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>open()</i>
<b>with more than two arguments</b> <br>
If <i>open()</i> is passed three arguments instead of two,
the second argument is used as the mode and the third
argument is taken to be the file name. This is primarily
useful for protecting against unintended magic behavior of
the traditional two-argument form. See &quot;open&quot; in
perlfunc.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>64&minus;bit
support</b> <br>
Any platform that has 64&minus;bit integers either</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">        (1) natively as longs or ints
        (2) via special compiler flags
        (3) using long long or int64_t</pre>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
unless you have the case (a) you will have to configure and
compile Perl using the &minus;Duse64bitint Configure
flag.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    NOTE: The Configure flags &minus;Duselonglong and &minus;Duse64bits have been
    deprecated.  Use &minus;Duse64bitint instead.</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There are
actually two modes of 64&minus;bitness: the first one is
achieved using Configure &minus;Duse64bitint and the second
one using Configure &minus;Duse64bitall. The difference is
that the first one is minimal and the second one maximal.
The first works in more places than the second.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<tt>&quot;use64bitint&quot;</tt> does only as much as is
required to get 64&minus;bit integers into Perl (this may
mean, for example, using &quot;long longs&quot;) while your
memory may still be limited to 2 gigabytes (because your
pointers could still be 32&minus;bit). Note that the name
<tt>&quot;64bitint&quot;</tt> does not imply that your C
compiler will be using 64&minus;bit
<tt>&quot;int&quot;</tt>s (it might, but it doesn&rsquo;t
have to): the <tt>&quot;use64bitint&quot;</tt> means that
you will be able to have 64 bits wide scalar values.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<tt>&quot;use64bitall&quot;</tt> goes all the way by
attempting to switch also integers (if it can), longs (and
pointers) to being 64&minus;bit. This may create an even
more binary incompatible Perl than &minus;Duse64bitint: the
resulting executable may not run at all in a 32&minus;bit
box, or you may have to reboot/reconfigure/rebuild your
operating system to be 64&minus;bit aware.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Natively
64&minus;bit systems like Alpha and Cray need neither
&minus;Duse64bitint nor &minus;Duse64bitall.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Last but not
least: note that due to Perl&rsquo;s habit of always using
floating point numbers, the quads are still not true
integers. When quads overflow their limits
(0...18_446_744_073_709_551_615 unsigned,
&minus;9_223_372_036_854_775_808...9_223_372_036_854_775_807
signed), they are silently promoted to floating point
numbers, after which they will start losing precision (in
their lower digits).</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    NOTE: 64&minus;bit support is still experimental on most platforms.
    Existing support only covers the LP64 data model.  In particular, the
    LLP64 data model is not yet supported.  64&minus;bit libraries and system
    APIs on many platforms have not stabilized&minus;&minus;your mileage may vary.</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Large file
support</b> <br>
If you have filesystems that support &quot;large files&quot;
(files larger than 2 gigabytes), you may now also be able to
create and access them from Perl.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    NOTE: The default action is to enable large file support, if
    available on the platform.</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the large
file support is on, and you have a Fcntl constant
O_LARGEFILE, the O_LARGEFILE is automatically added to the
flags of <i>sysopen()</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Beware that
unless your filesystem also supports &quot;sparse
files&quot; seeking to umpteen petabytes may be
inadvisable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that in
addition to requiring a proper file system to do large files
you may also need to adjust your per-process (or your
per-system, or per-process-group, or per-user-group) maximum
filesize limits before running Perl scripts that try to
handle large files, especially if you intend to write such
files.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Finally, in
addition to your process/process group maximum filesize
limits, you may have quota limits on your filesystems that
stop you (your user id or your user group id) from using
large files.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Adjusting your
process/user/group/file system/operating system limits is
outside the scope of Perl core language. For process limits,
you may try increasing the limits using your shell&rsquo;s
limits/limit/ulimit command before running Perl. The
BSD::Resource extension (not included with the standard Perl
distribution) may also be of use, it offers the
getrlimit/setrlimit interface that can be used to adjust
process resource usage limits, including the maximum
filesize limit.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Long
doubles</b> <br>
In some systems you may be able to use long doubles to
enhance the range and precision of your double precision
floating point numbers (that is, Perl&rsquo;s numbers). Use
Configure &minus;Duselongdouble to enable this support (if
it is available).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&quot;more
bits&quot;</b> <br>
You can &quot;Configure &minus;Dusemorebits&quot; to turn on
both the 64&minus;bit support and the long double
support.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Enhanced
support for</b> <i>sort()</i> <b>subroutines</b> <br>
Perl subroutines with a prototype of
<tt>&quot;($$)&quot;</tt>, and XSUBs in general, can now be
used as sort subroutines. In either case, the two elements
to be compared are passed as normal parameters in
<tt>@_</tt>. See &quot;sort&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For
unprototyped sort subroutines, the historical behavior of
passing the elements to be compared as the global variables
<tt>$a</tt> and <tt>$b</tt> remains unchanged.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&quot;sort
$coderef @foo&quot; allowed</b> <i><br>
sort()</i> did not accept a subroutine reference as the
comparison function in earlier versions. This is now
permitted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>File
globbing implemented internally</b> <br>
Perl now uses the File::Glob implementation of the
<i>glob()</i> operator automatically. This avoids using an
external csh process and the problems associated with
it.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    NOTE: This is currently an experimental feature.  Interfaces and
    implementation are subject to change.</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Support for
<small>CHECK</small> blocks</b> <br>
In addition to <tt>&quot;BEGIN&quot;</tt>,
<tt>&quot;INIT&quot;</tt>, <tt>&quot;END&quot;</tt>,
<tt>&quot;DESTROY&quot;</tt> and
<tt>&quot;AUTOLOAD&quot;</tt>, subroutines named
<tt>&quot;CHECK&quot;</tt> are now special. These are queued
up during compilation and behave similar to
<small>END</small> blocks, except they are called at the end
of compilation rather than at the end of execution. They
cannot be called directly.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b><small>POSIX</small>
character class syntax [: :] supported</b> <br>
For example to match alphabetic characters use
/[[:alpha:]]/. See perlre for details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Better
pseudo-random number generator</b> <br>
In 5.005_0x and earlier, perl&rsquo;s <i>rand()</i> function
used the C library <i>rand</i>(3) function. As of 5.005_52,
Configure tests for <i>drand48()</i>, <i>random()</i>, and
<i>rand()</i> (in that order) and picks the first one it
finds.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These changes
should result in better random numbers from
<i>rand()</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Improved
&quot;qw//&quot; operator</b> <br>
The <tt>&quot;qw//&quot;</tt> operator is now evaluated at
compile time into a true list instead of being replaced with
a run time call to <tt>&quot;split()&quot;</tt>. This
removes the confusing misbehaviour of
<tt>&quot;qw//&quot;</tt> in scalar context, which had
inherited that behaviour from <i>split()</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Thus:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    $foo = ($bar) = qw(a b c); print &quot;$foo|$bar\n&quot;;</pre>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Better
worst-case behavior of hashes</b> <br>
Small changes in the hashing algorithm have been implemented
in order to improve the distribution of lower order bits in
the hashed value. This is expected to yield better
performance on keys that are repeated sequences.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>pack()</i>
<b>format &rsquo;Z&rsquo; supported</b> <br>
The new format type &rsquo;Z&rsquo; is useful for packing
and unpacking null-terminated strings. See &quot;pack&quot;
in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>pack()</i>
<b>format modifier &rsquo;!&rsquo; supported</b> <br>
The new format type modifier &rsquo;!&rsquo; is useful for
packing and unpacking native shorts, ints, and longs. See
&quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>pack()</i>
<b>and</b> <i>unpack()</i> <b>support counted strings</b>
<br>
The template character &rsquo;/&rsquo; can be used to
specify a counted string type to be packed or unpacked. See
&quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Comments
in</b> <i>pack()</i> <b>templates</b> <br>
The &rsquo;#&rsquo; character in a template introduces a
comment up to end of the line. This facilitates
documentation of <i>pack()</i> templates.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Weak
references</b> <br>
In previous versions of Perl, you couldn&rsquo;t cache
objects so as to allow them to be deleted if the last
reference from outside the cache is deleted. The reference
in the cache would hold a reference count on the object and
the objects would never be destroyed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Another
familiar problem is with circular references. When an object
references itself, its reference count would never go down
to zero, and it would not get destroyed until the program is
about to exit.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Weak references
solve this by allowing you to &quot;weaken&quot; any
reference, that is, make it not count towards the reference
count. When the last non-weak reference to an object is
deleted, the object is destroyed and all the weak references
to the object are automatically undef-ed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To use this
feature, you need the Devel::WeakRef package from
<small>CPAN</small> , which contains additional
documentation.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    NOTE: This is an experimental feature.  Details are subject to change.</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Binary
numbers supported</b> <br>
Binary numbers are now supported as literals, in s?printf
formats, and <tt>&quot;oct()&quot;</tt>:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    $answer = 0b101010;
    printf &quot;The answer is: %b\n&quot;, oct(&quot;0b101010&quot;);</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Lvalue
subroutines</b> <br>
Subroutines can now return modifiable lvalues. See
&quot;Lvalue subroutines&quot; in perlsub.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    NOTE: This is an experimental feature.  Details are subject to change.</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Some arrows
may be omitted in calls through references</b> <br>
Perl now allows the arrow to be omitted in many constructs
involving subroutine calls through references. For example,
<tt>&quot;$foo[10]&minus;&gt;('foo')&quot;</tt> may now be
written <tt>&quot;$foo[10]('foo')&quot;</tt>. This is rather
similar to how the arrow may be omitted from
<tt>&quot;$foo[10]&minus;&gt;{'foo'}&quot;</tt>. Note
however, that the arrow is still required for
<tt>&quot;foo(10)&minus;&gt;('bar')&quot;</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Boolean
assignment operators are legal lvalues</b> <br>
Constructs such as <tt>&quot;($a ||= 2) += 1&quot;</tt> are
now allowed.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>exists()</i>
<b>is supported on subroutine names</b> <br>
The <i>exists()</i> builtin now works on subroutine names. A
subroutine is considered to exist if it has been declared
(even if implicitly). See &quot;exists&quot; in perlfunc for
examples.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>exists()</i>
<b>and</b> <i>delete()</i> <b>are supported on array
elements</b> <br>
The <i>exists()</i> and <i>delete()</i> builtins now work on
simple arrays as well. The behavior is similar to that on
hash elements.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>exists()</i>
can be used to check whether an array element has been
initialized. This avoids autovivifying array elements that
don&rsquo;t exist. If the array is tied, the
<i><small>EXISTS</small> ()</i> method in the corresponding
tied package will be invoked.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>delete()</i>
may be used to remove an element from the array and return
it. The array element at that position returns to its
uninitialized state, so that testing for the same element
with <i>exists()</i> will return false. If the element
happens to be the one at the end, the size of the array also
shrinks up to the highest element that tests true for
<i>exists()</i>, or 0 if none such is found. If the array is
tied, the <i><small>DELETE</small> ()</i> method in the
corresponding tied package will be invoked.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">See
&quot;exists&quot; in perlfunc and &quot;delete&quot; in
perlfunc for examples.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Pseudo-hashes
work better</b> <br>
Dereferencing some types of reference values in a
pseudo-hash, such as
<tt>&quot;$ph&minus;&gt;{foo}[1]&quot;</tt>, was
accidentally disallowed. This has been corrected.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When applied to
a pseudo-hash element, <i>exists()</i> now reports whether
the specified value exists, not merely if the key is
valid.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>delete()</i>
now works on pseudo-hashes. When given a pseudo-hash element
or slice it deletes the values corresponding to the keys
(but not the keys themselves). See &quot;Pseudo-hashes:
Using an array as a hash&quot; in perlref.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Pseudo-hash
slices with constant keys are now optimized to array lookups
at compile-time.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">List
assignments to pseudo-hash slices are now supported.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<tt>&quot;fields&quot;</tt> pragma now provides ways to
create pseudo-hashes, via <i>fields::new()</i> and
<i>fields::phash()</i>. See fields.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    NOTE: The pseudo&minus;hash data type continues to be experimental.
    Limiting oneself to the interface elements provided by the
    fields pragma will provide protection from any future changes.</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Automatic
flushing of output buffers</b> <i><br>
fork()</i>, <i>exec()</i>, <i>system()</i>, qx//, and pipe
<i>open()</i>s now flush buffers of all files opened for
output when the operation was attempted. This mostly
eliminates confusing buffering mishaps suffered by users
unaware of how Perl internally handles I/O.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This is not
supported on some platforms like Solaris where a suitably
correct implementation of fflush( <small>NULL</small> )
isn&rsquo;t available.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Better
diagnostics on meaningless filehandle operations</b> <br>
Constructs such as <tt>&quot;open(&lt;FH&gt;)&quot;</tt> and
<tt>&quot;close(&lt;FH&gt;)&quot;</tt> are compile time
errors. Attempting to read from filehandles that were opened
only for writing will now produce warnings (just as writing
to read-only filehandles does).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Where
possible, buffered data discarded from duped input
filehandle</b> <tt><br>
&quot;open(NEW, &quot;&lt;&amp;OLD&quot;)&quot;</tt> now
attempts to discard any data that was previously read and
buffered in <tt>&quot;OLD&quot;</tt> before duping the
handle. On platforms where doing this is allowed, the next
read operation on <tt>&quot;NEW&quot;</tt> will return the
same data as the corresponding operation on
<tt>&quot;OLD&quot;</tt>. Formerly, it would have returned
the data from the start of the following disk block
instead.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>eof()</i>

<tt>&quot;eof()&quot;</tt> has been changed to have a little
magic of its own, it now opens the
<tt>&quot;&lt;&gt;&quot;</tt> files.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>binmode()</i>
<b>can be used to set :crlf and :raw modes</b> <i><br>
binmode()</i> now accepts a second argument that specifies a
discipline for the handle in question. The two
pseudo-disciplines &quot;:raw&quot; and &quot;:crlf&quot;
are currently supported on DOS-derivative platforms. See
&quot;binmode&quot; in perlfunc and open.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>system()</i><b>,
backticks and pipe open now reflect</b> <i>exec()</i>
<b>failure</b> <br>
On Unix and similar platforms, <i>system()</i>, <i>qx()</i>
and open( <small>FOO</small> , &quot;cmd |&quot;) etc., are
implemented via <i>fork()</i> and <i>exec()</i>. When the
underlying <i>exec()</i> fails, earlier versions did not
report the error properly, since the <i>exec()</i> happened
to be in a different process.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The child
process now communicates with the parent about the error in
launching the external command, which allows these
constructs to return with their usual error value and set
$!.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Improved

Line numbers are no longer suppressed (under most likely
circumstances) during the global destruction phase.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Diagnostics

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Unrecognized
alphabetic escapes encountered when parsing quote constructs
now generate a warning, since they may take on new semantics
in later versions of Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Many

warning was provoked, like so:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    Use of uninitialized value in concatenation (.) at (eval 1) line 1.
    Use of uninitialized value in print at (eval 1) line 1.</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Diagnostics
that occur within eval may also report the file and line
number where the eval is located, in addition to the eval
sequence number and the line number within the evaluated
text itself. For example:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    Not enough arguments for scalar at (eval 4)[newlib/perl5db.pl:1411] line 2, at EOF</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Diagnostics

<tt>&quot;stderr&quot;</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>More
consistent close-on-exec behavior</b> <br>
On systems that support a close-on-exec flag on filehandles,
the flag is now set for any handles created by
<i>pipe()</i>, <i>socketpair()</i>, <i>socket()</i>, and
<i>accept()</i>, if that is warranted by the value of $^F
that may be in effect. Earlier versions neglected to set the
flag for handles created with these operators. See

when used in this way; others silently did the wrong
thing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
parenthesized forms of most unary operators that expect a
single argument now ensure that they are not called with
more than one argument, making the cases shown above syntax
errors. The usual behaviour of:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    print defined &amp;foo, &amp;bar, &amp;baz;
    print uc &quot;foo&quot;, &quot;bar&quot;, &quot;baz&quot;;

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">remains
unchanged. See perlop.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Bit
operators support full native integer width</b> <br>
The bit operators (&amp; | ^ ~ &lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;) now
operate on the full native integral width (the exact size of
which is available in <tt>$Config</tt>{ivsize}). For
example, if your platform is either natively 64&minus;bit or
if Perl has been configured to use 64&minus;bit integers,
these operations apply to 8 bytes (as opposed to 4 bytes on
32&minus;bit platforms). For portability, be sure to mask
off the excess bits in the result of unary
<tt>&quot;~&quot;</tt>, e.g., <tt>&quot;~$x &amp;
0xffffffff&quot;</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Improved

affect their own encrypted password and login shell.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The variable
modified by <i>shmread()</i>, and messages returned by
<i>msgrcv()</i> (and its object-oriented interface
IPC::SysV::Msg::rcv) are also tainted, because other
untrusted processes can modify messages and shared memory
segments for their own nefarious purposes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>More
functional bareword prototype (*)</b> <br>
Bareword prototypes have been rationalized to enable them to
be used to override builtins that accept barewords and
interpret them in a special way, such as

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Arguments

operations may be overridden locally by importing
subroutines of the same name into the current package (or
globally by importing them into the

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>$^X
variables may now have names longer than one character</b>
<br>
Formerly, $^X was synonymous with ${&quot;\cX&quot;}, but
$^XY was a syntax error. Now variable names that begin with
a control character may be arbitrarily long. However, for
compatibility reasons, these variables <i>must</i> be
written with explicit braces, as <tt>&quot;${^XY}&quot;</tt>
for example. <tt>&quot;${^XYZ}&quot;</tt> is synonymous with
${&quot;\cXYZ&quot;}. Variable names with more than one
control character, such as <tt>&quot;${^XY^Z}&quot;</tt>,
are illegal.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The old syntax
has not changed. As before, &lsquo;^X&rsquo; may be either a
literal control-X character or the two-character sequence
&lsquo;caret&rsquo; plus &lsquo;X&rsquo;. When braces are
omitted, the variable name stops after the control
character. Thus <tt>&quot;$^XYZ&quot;</tt> continues to be
synonymous with <tt>&quot;$^X . &quot;YZ&quot;&quot;</tt> as
before.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As before,
lexical variables may not have names beginning with control
characters. As before, variables whose names begin with a
control character are always forced to be in package
&lsquo;main&rsquo;. All such variables are reserved for
future extensions, except those that begin with
<tt>&quot;^_&quot;</tt>, which may be used by user programs
and are guaranteed not to acquire special meaning in any
future version of Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>New variable

$^C</tt> has a boolean value that reflects whether perl is
being run in compile-only mode (i.e. via the

<small>BEGIN</small> blocks are executed under such
conditions, this variable enables perl code to determine
whether actions that make sense only during normal running
are warranted. See perlvar.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>New variable
$^V contains Perl version as a string</b> <tt><br>
$^V</tt> contains the Perl version number as a string

In double-quoted strings, arrays now interpolate, no matter

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The ByteLoader is a dedicated
extension to generate and run Perl bytecode. See
ByteLoader.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">constant</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">References can now be used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The new version
also allows a leading underscore in constant names, but
disallows a double leading underscore (as in
&quot;__LINE__&quot;). Some other names are disallowed or
warned against, including <small>BEGIN</small> ,
<small>END</small> , etc. Some names which were forced into
main:: used to fail silently in some cases; now
they&rsquo;re fatal (outside of main::) and an optional
warning (inside of main::). The ability to detect whether a
constant had been set with a given name has been added.</p>

deep data structures. See Data::Dumper.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The Dumpvalue module provides
screen dumps of Perl data.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">DynaLoader</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">DynaLoader now supports a

unloading shared objects using <i>dlclose()</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Perl can also

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Fcntl</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">More Fcntl constants added:
F_SETLK64, F_SETLKW64, O_LARGEFILE for large file (more than
4GB) access ( <small>NOTE:</small> the O_LARGEFILE is
automatically added to <i>sysopen()</i> flags if large file
support has been configured, as is the default),
Free/Net/OpenBSD locking behaviour flags F_FLOCK, F_POSIX,
Linux F_SHLCK, and O_ACCMODE: the combined mask of O_RDONLY,
O_WRONLY, and O_RDWR. The <i>seek()</i>/<i>sysseek()</i>
constants <small>SEEK_SET</small> , <small>SEEK_CUR</small>
, and <small>SEEK_END</small> are available via the
<tt>&quot;:seek&quot;</tt> tag. The
<i>chmod()</i>/<i>stat()</i> S_IF* constants and S_IS*
functions are available via the <tt>&quot;:mode&quot;</tt>
tag.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">File::Compare</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A <i>compare_text()</i>
function has been added, which allows custom comparison
functions. See File::Compare.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">File::Find</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">File::Find now works correctly
when the <i>wanted()</i> function is either autoloaded or is
a symbolic reference.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">A bug that
caused File::Find to lose track of the working directory
when pruning top-level directories has been fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">File::Find now
also supports several other options to control its behavior.
It can follow symbolic links if the
<tt>&quot;follow&quot;</tt> option is specified. Enabling
the <tt>&quot;no_chdir&quot;</tt> option will make
File::Find skip changing the current directory when walking
directories. The <tt>&quot;untaint&quot;</tt> flag can be
useful when running with taint checks enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">See
File::Find.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">File::Glob</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This extension implements
BSD-style file globbing. By default, it will also be used
for the internal implementation of the <i>glob()</i>
operator. See File::Glob.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">File::Spec</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">New methods have been added to
the File::Spec module: <i>devnull()</i> returns the name of
the null device (/dev/null on Unix) and <i>tmpdir()</i> the
name of the temp directory (normally /tmp on Unix). There
are now also methods to convert between absolute and
relative filenames: <i>abs2rel()</i> and <i>rel2abs()</i>.
For compatibility with operating systems that specify volume
names in file paths, the <i>splitpath()</i>,
<i>splitdir()</i>, and <i>catdir()</i> methods have been
added.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">File::Spec::Functions</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The new File::Spec::Functions
modules provides a function interface to the File::Spec
module. Allows shorthand</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    $fullname = catfile($dir1, $dir2, $file);</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">instead of</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    $fullname = File::Spec&minus;&gt;catfile($dir1, $dir2, $file);</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%;">Getopt::Long</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Getopt::Long licensing has
changed to allow the Perl Artistic License as well as the
<small>GPL</small> . It used to be <small>GPL</small> only,
which got in the way of non-GPL applications that wanted to
use Getopt::Long.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Getopt::Long
encourages the use of Pod::Usage to produce help messages.
For example:</p>

<tt>&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;</tt>, <tt>&quot;&amp;&quot;</tt>,
<tt>&quot;|&quot;</tt>, and <tt>&quot;~&quot;</tt> are now
supported on bigints.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Math::Complex</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The accessor methods Re, Im,
arg, abs, rho, and theta can now also act as mutators
(accessor <tt>$z</tt>&minus;&gt;<i>Re()</i>, mutator
<tt>$z</tt>&minus;&gt;<i>Re</i>(3)).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The class
method <tt>&quot;display_format&quot;</tt> and the
corresponding object method
<tt>&quot;display_format&quot;</tt>, in addition to
accepting just one argument, now can also accept a parameter
hash. Recognized keys of a parameter hash are
<tt>&quot;style&quot;</tt>, which corresponds to the old one
parameter case, and two new parameters:
<tt>&quot;format&quot;</tt>, which is a
<i>printf()</i>&minus;style format string (defaults usually
to <tt>&quot;%.15g&quot;</tt>, you can revert to the default
by setting the format string to <tt>&quot;undef&quot;</tt>)
used for both parts of a complex number, and
<tt>&quot;polar_pretty_print&quot;</tt> (defaults to true),
which controls whether an attempt is made to try to
recognize small multiples and rationals of pi (2pi, pi/2) at
the argument (angle) of a polar complex number.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The potentially
disruptive change is that in list context both methods now
<i>return the parameter hash</i>, instead of only the value
of the <tt>&quot;style&quot;</tt> parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Math::Trig</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A little bit of radial
trigonometry (cylindrical and spherical), radial coordinate
conversions, and the great circle distance were added.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Pod::Parser,
Pod::InputObjects</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Pod::Parser is a base class for
parsing and selecting sections of pod documentation from an
input stream. This module takes care of identifying pod
paragraphs and commands in the input and hands off the
parsed paragraphs and commands to user-defined methods which
are free to interpret or translate them as they see fit.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Pod::InputObjects
defines some input objects needed by Pod::Parser, and for
advanced users of Pod::Parser that need more about a command
besides its name and text.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">As of release
5.6.0 of Perl, Pod::Parser is now the officially sanctioned
&quot;base parser code&quot; recommended for use by all
pod2xxx translators. Pod::Text (pod2text) and Pod::Man
(pod2man) have already been converted to use Pod::Parser and
efforts to convert Pod::HTML (pod2html) are already
underway. For any questions or comments about pod parsing
and translating issues and utilities, please use the
pod&minus;people@perl.org mailing list.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">For further
information, please see Pod::Parser and
Pod::InputObjects.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Pod::Checker, podchecker</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This utility checks pod files
for correct syntax, according to perlpod. Obvious errors are
flagged as such, while warnings are printed for mistakes
that can be handled gracefully. The checklist is not
complete yet. See Pod::Checker.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Pod::ParseUtils, Pod::Find</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">These modules provide a set of
gizmos that are useful mainly for pod translators. Pod::Find
traverses directory structures and returns found pod files,
along with their canonical names (like
<tt>&quot;File::Spec::Unix&quot;</tt>). Pod::ParseUtils
contains <b>Pod::List</b> (useful for storing pod list
information), <b>Pod::Hyperlink</b> (for parsing the
contents of <tt>&quot;L&lt;&gt;&quot;</tt> sequences) and
<b>Pod::Cache</b> (for caching information about pod files,
e.g., link nodes).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Pod::Select, podselect</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Pod::Select is a subclass of
Pod::Parser which provides a function named
&quot;<i>podselect()</i>&quot; to filter out user-specified
sections of raw pod documentation from an input stream.
podselect is a script that provides access to Pod::Select
from other scripts to be used as a filter. See
Pod::Select.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Pod::Usage, pod2usage</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Pod::Usage provides the
function &quot;<i>pod2usage()</i>&quot; to print usage
messages for a Perl script based on its embedded pod
documentation. The <i>pod2usage()</i> function is generally
useful to all script authors since it lets them write and
maintain a single source (the pods) for documentation, thus
removing the need to create and maintain redundant usage
message text consisting of information already in the
pods.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">There is also a
pod2usage script which can be used from other kinds of
scripts to print usage messages from pods (even for non-Perl
scripts with pods embedded in comments).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">For details and
examples, please see Pod::Usage.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Pod::Text and Pod::Man</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Pod::Text has been rewritten to
use Pod::Parser. While <i>pod2text()</i> is still available
for backwards compatibility, the module now has a new
preferred interface. See Pod::Text for the details. The new
Pod::Text module is easily subclassed for tweaks to the
output, and two such subclasses (Pod::Text::Termcap for
man-page-style bold and underlining using termcap
information, and Pod::Text::Color for markup with
<small>ANSI</small> color sequences) are now standard.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">pod2man has
been turned into a module, Pod::Man, which also uses
Pod::Parser. In the process, several outstanding bugs
related to quotes in section headers, quoting of code
escapes, and nested lists have been fixed. pod2man is now a
wrapper script around this module.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">SDBM_File</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">An <small>EXISTS</small> method
has been added to this module (and <i>sdbm_exists()</i> has
been added to the underlying sdbm library), so one can now
call exists on an SDBM_File tied hash and get the correct
result, rather than a runtime error.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">A bug that may
have caused data loss when more than one disk block happens
to be read from the database in a single
<i><small>FETCH</small> ()</i> has been fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Sys::Syslog</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Sys::Syslog now uses XSUBs to
access facilities from syslog.h so it no longer requires
syslog.ph to exist.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Sys::Hostname</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Sys::Hostname now uses XSUBs to
call the C library&rsquo;s <i>gethostname()</i> or
<i>uname()</i> if they exist.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Term::ANSIColor</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Term::ANSIColor is a very
simple module to provide easy and readable access to the
<small>ANSI</small> color and highlighting escape sequences,
supported by most <small>ANSI</small> terminal emulators. It
is now included standard.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Time::Local</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The <i>timelocal()</i> and
<i>timegm()</i> functions used to silently return bogus
results when the date fell outside the machine&rsquo;s
integer range. They now consistently <i>croak()</i> if the
date falls in an unsupported range.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Win32</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The error return value in list
context has been changed for all functions that return a
list of values. Previously these functions returned a list
with a single element <tt>&quot;undef&quot;</tt> if an error
occurred. Now these functions return the empty list in these
situations. This applies to the following functions:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    Win32::FsType
    Win32::GetOSVersion</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The remaining
functions are unchanged and continue to return
<tt>&quot;undef&quot;</tt> on error even in list
context.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The
Win32::SetLastError( <small>ERROR</small> ) function has
been added as a complement to the
<i>Win32::GetLastError()</i> function.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The new
Win32::GetFullPathName( <small>FILENAME</small> ) returns
the full absolute pathname for <small>FILENAME</small> in
scalar context. In list context it returns a two-element
list containing the fully qualified directory name and the
filename. See Win32.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">XSLoader</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The XSLoader extension is a
simpler alternative to DynaLoader. See XSLoader.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><small>DBM</small> Filters</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A new feature called &quot;
<small>DBM</small> Filters&quot; has been added to all the
<small>DBM</small> modules&minus;&minus;DB_File, GDBM_File,
NDBM_File, ODBM_File, and SDBM_File. <small>DBM</small>
Filters add four new methods to each <small>DBM</small>
module:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    filter_store_key
    filter_store_value
    filter_fetch_key
    filter_fetch_value</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">These can be
used to filter key-value pairs before the pairs are written
to the database or just after they are read from the
database. See perldbmfilter for further information.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Pragmata</b>
<tt><br>
&quot;use attrs&quot;</tt> is now obsolete, and is only
provided for backward-compatibility. It&rsquo;s been
replaced by the <tt>&quot;sub : attributes&quot;</tt>
syntax. See &quot;Subroutine Attributes&quot; in perlsub and
attributes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Lexical
warnings pragma, <tt>&quot;use warnings;&quot;</tt>, to
control optional warnings. See perllexwarn.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><tt>&quot;use
filetest&quot;</tt> to control the behaviour of filetests
(<tt>&quot;&minus;r&quot; &quot;&minus;w&quot;</tt> ...).
Currently only one subpragma implemented, &quot;use filetest
&rsquo;access&rsquo;;&quot;, that uses <i>access</i>(2) or
equivalent to check permissions instead of using
<i>stat</i>(2) as usual. This matters in filesystems where
there are ACLs (access control lists): the <i>stat</i>(2)
might lie, but <i>access</i>(2) knows better.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<tt>&quot;open&quot;</tt> pragma can be used to specify
default disciplines for handle constructors (e.g.
<i>open()</i>) and for qx//. The two pseudo-disciplines
<tt>&quot;:raw&quot;</tt> and <tt>&quot;:crlf&quot;</tt> are
currently supported on DOS-derivative platforms (i.e. where
binmode is not a no-op). See also &quot;<i>binmode()</i> can
be used to set :crlf and :raw modes&quot;.</p>

<h2>Performance enhancements
<a name="Performance enhancements"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Simple</b>
<i>sort()</i> <b>using { $a &lt;=&gt; $b } and the like are
optimized</b> <br>
Many common <i>sort()</i> operations using a simple inlined
block are now optimized for faster performance.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Optimized
assignments to lexical variables</b> <br>
Certain operations in the <small>RHS</small> of assignment
statements have been optimized to directly set the lexical
variable on the <small>LHS</small> , eliminating redundant
copying overheads.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Faster
subroutine calls</b> <br>
Minor changes in how subroutine calls are handled internally
provide marginal improvements in performance.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>delete()</i><b>,</b>
<i>each()</i><b>,</b> <i>values()</i> <b>and hash iteration
are faster</b> <br>
The hash values returned by <i>delete()</i>, <i>each()</i>,
<i>values()</i> and hashes in a list context are the actual
values in the hash, instead of copies. This results in
significantly better performance, because it eliminates
needless copying in most situations.</p>

<h2>Installation and Configuration Improvements
<a name="Installation and Configuration Improvements"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;Dusethreads
means something different</b> <br>
The &minus;Dusethreads flag now enables the experimental
interpreter-based thread support by default. To get the
flavor of experimental threads that was in 5.005 instead,
you need to run Configure with &quot;&minus;Dusethreads
&minus;Duse5005threads&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As of v5.6.0,
interpreter-threads support is still lacking a way to create
new threads from Perl (i.e., <tt>&quot;use
Thread;&quot;</tt> will not work with interpreter threads).
<tt>&quot;use Thread;&quot;</tt> continues to be available
when you specify the &minus;Duse5005threads option to
Configure, bugs and all.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    NOTE: Support for threads continues to be an experimental feature.
    Interfaces and implementation are subject to sudden and drastic changes.</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>New
Configure flags</b> <br>
The following new flags may be enabled on the Configure
command line by running Configure with
<tt>&quot;&minus;Dflag&quot;</tt>.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    usemultiplicity
    usethreads useithreads      (new interpreter threads: no Perl API yet)
    usethreads use5005threads   (threads as they were in 5.005)
    use64bitint                 (equal to now deprecated 'use64bits')
    use64bitall
    uselongdouble
    usemorebits
    uselargefiles
    usesocks                    (only SOCKS v5 supported)</pre>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Threadedness
and 64&minus;bitness now more daring</b> <br>
The Configure options enabling the use of threads and the
use of 64&minus;bitness are now more daring in the sense
that they no more have an explicit list of operating systems
of known threads/64&minus;bit capabilities. In other words:
if your operating system has the necessary APIs and
datatypes, you should be able just to go ahead and use them,
for threads by Configure &minus;Dusethreads, and for 64 bits
either explicitly by Configure &minus;Duse64bitint or
implicitly if your system has 64&minus;bit wide datatypes.
See also &quot;64&minus;bit support&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Long
Doubles</b> <br>
Some platforms have &quot;long doubles&quot;, floating point
numbers of even larger range than ordinary
&quot;doubles&quot;. To enable using long doubles for
Perl&rsquo;s scalars, use &minus;Duselongdouble.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;Dusemorebits</b>
<br>
You can enable both &minus;Duse64bitint and
&minus;Duselongdouble with &minus;Dusemorebits. See also
&quot;64&minus;bit support&quot;.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;Duselargefiles</b>
<br>
Some platforms support system APIs that are capable of
handling large files (typically, files larger than two
gigabytes). Perl will try to use these APIs if you ask for
&minus;Duselargefiles.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">See &quot;Large
file support&quot; for more information.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>installusrbinperl</b>
<br>
You can use &quot;Configure &minus;Uinstallusrbinperl&quot;
which causes installperl to skip installing perl also as
/usr/bin/perl. This is useful if you prefer not to modify
/usr/bin for some reason or another but harmful because many
scripts assume to find Perl in /usr/bin/perl.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b><small>SOCKS</small>
support</b> <br>
You can use &quot;Configure &minus;Dusesocks&quot; which
causes Perl to probe for the <small>SOCKS</small> proxy
protocol library (v5, not v4). For more information on
<small>SOCKS</small> , see:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    http://www.socks.nec.com/</pre>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&quot;&minus;A&quot;
flag</b> <br>
You can &quot;post-edit&quot; the Configure variables using
the Configure <tt>&quot;&minus;A&quot;</tt> switch. The
editing happens immediately after the platform specific
hints files have been processed but before the actual
configuration process starts. Run <tt>&quot;Configure
&minus;h&quot;</tt> to find out the full
<tt>&quot;&minus;A&quot;</tt> syntax.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Enhanced
Installation Directories</b> <br>
The installation structure has been enriched to improve the
support for maintaining multiple versions of perl, to
provide locations for vendor-supplied modules, scripts, and
manpages, and to ease maintenance of locally-added modules,
scripts, and manpages. See the section on Installation
Directories in the <small>INSTALL</small> file for complete
details. For most users building and installing from source,
the defaults should be fine.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you
previously used <tt>&quot;Configure
&minus;Dsitelib&quot;</tt> or
<tt>&quot;&minus;Dsitearch&quot;</tt> to set special values
for library directories, you might wish to consider using
the new <tt>&quot;&minus;Dsiteprefix&quot;</tt> setting
instead. Also, if you wish to re-use a config.sh file from
an earlier version of perl, you should be sure to check that
Configure makes sensible choices for the new directories.
See <small>INSTALL</small> for complete details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Win32</b>
<br>
Perl can now emulate <i>fork()</i> internally, using
multiple interpreters running in different concurrent
threads. This support must be enabled at build time. See
perlfork for detailed information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When given a
pathname that consists only of a drivename, such as
<tt>&quot;A:&quot;</tt>, <i>opendir()</i> and <i>stat()</i>
now use the current working directory for the drive rather
than the drive root.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The builtin
<small>XSUB</small> functions in the Win32:: namespace are
documented. See Win32.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$^X now
contains the full path name of the running executable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A
<i>Win32::GetLongPathName()</i> function is provided to
complement <i>Win32::GetFullPathName()</i> and
<i>Win32::GetShortPathName()</i>. See Win32.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>POSIX::uname()</i>
is supported.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">system(1,...)
now returns true process IDs rather than process handles.
<i>kill()</i> accepts any real process id, rather than
strictly return values from system(1,...).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For better
compatibility with Unix, <tt>&quot;kill(0, $pid)&quot;</tt>
can now be used to test whether a process exists.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<tt>&quot;Shell&quot;</tt> module is supported.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Better support
for building Perl under command.com in Windows 95 has been
added.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Scripts are
read in binary mode by default to allow ByteLoader (and the
filter mechanism in general) to work properly. For
compatibility, the <small>DATA</small> filehandle will be
set to text mode if a carriage return is detected at the end
of the line containing the __END__ or __DATA__ token; if
not, the <small>DATA</small> filehandle will be left open in
binary mode. Earlier versions always opened the
<small>DATA</small> filehandle in text mode.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>glob()</i> operator is implemented via the
<tt>&quot;File::Glob&quot;</tt> extension, which supports
glob syntax of the C shell. This increases the flexibility
of the <i>glob()</i> operator, but there may be
compatibility issues for programs that relied on the older
globbing syntax. If you want to preserve compatibility with
the older syntax, you might want to run perl with
<tt>&quot;&minus;MFile::DosGlob&quot;</tt>. For details and
compatibility information, see File::Glob.</p>

<h2>Significant bug fixes
<a name="Significant bug fixes"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&lt;
<small>HANDLE</small> &gt; on empty files</b> <br>
With <tt>$/</tt> set to <tt>&quot;undef&quot;</tt>,
&quot;slurping&quot; an empty file returns a string of zero
length (instead of <tt>&quot;undef&quot;</tt>, as it used
to) the first time the <small>HANDLE</small> is read after
<tt>$/</tt> is set to <tt>&quot;undef&quot;</tt>. Further
reads yield <tt>&quot;undef&quot;</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This means that
the following will append &quot;foo&quot; to an empty file
(it used to do nothing):</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    perl &minus;0777 &minus;pi &minus;e 's/^/foo/' empty_file</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The behaviour
of:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    perl &minus;pi &minus;e 's/^/foo/' empty_file</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">is unchanged
(it continues to leave the file empty).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&quot;eval
'...'&quot; improvements</b> <br>
Line numbers (as reflected by <i>caller()</i> and most
diagnostics) within <tt>&quot;eval '...'&quot;</tt> were
often incorrect where here documents were involved. This has
been corrected.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Lexical lookups
for variables appearing in <tt>&quot;eval '...'&quot;</tt>
within functions that were themselves called within an
<tt>&quot;eval '...'&quot;</tt> were searching the wrong
place for lexicals. The lexical search now correctly ends at
the subroutine&rsquo;s block boundary.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The use of
<tt>&quot;return&quot;</tt> within <tt>&quot;eval
{...}&quot;</tt> caused $@ not to be reset correctly when no
exception occurred within the eval. This has been fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Parsing of here
documents used to be flawed when they appeared as the
replacement expression in <tt>&quot;eval
's/.../.../e'&quot;</tt>. This has been fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>All
compilation errors are true errors</b> <br>
Some &quot;errors&quot; encountered at compile time were by
necessity generated as warnings followed by eventual
termination of the program. This enabled more such errors to
be reported in a single run, rather than causing a hard stop
at the first error that was encountered.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The mechanism
for reporting such errors has been reimplemented to queue
compile-time errors and report them at the end of the
compilation as true errors rather than as warnings. This
fixes cases where error messages leaked through in the form
of warnings when code was compiled at run time using
<tt>&quot;eval STRING&quot;</tt>, and also allows such
errors to be reliably trapped using <tt>&quot;eval
&quot;...&quot;&quot;</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Implicitly
closed filehandles are safer</b> <br>
Sometimes implicitly closed filehandles (as when they are
localized, and Perl automatically closes them on exiting the
scope) could inadvertently set $? or $!. This has been
corrected.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Behavior of
list slices is more consistent</b> <br>
When taking a slice of a literal list (as opposed to a slice
of an array or hash), Perl used to return an empty list if
the result happened to be composed of all undef values.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The new
behavior is to produce an empty list if (and only if) the
original list was empty. Consider the following example:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    @a = (1,undef,undef,2)[2,1,2];</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The old
behavior would have resulted in <tt>@a</tt> having no
elements. The new behavior ensures it has three undefined
elements.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note in
particular that the behavior of slices of the following
cases remains unchanged:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    @a = ()[1,2];
    @a = (getpwent)[7,0];
    @a = (anything_returning_empty_list())[2,1,2];
    @a = @b[2,1,2];
    @a = @c{'a','b','c'};</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">See
perldata.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&quot;(\$)&quot;
prototype and $foo{a}</b> <br>
A scalar reference prototype now correctly allows a hash or
array element in that slot.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&quot;goto
&amp;sub&quot; and <small>AUTOLOAD</small></b> <br>
The <tt>&quot;goto &amp;sub&quot;</tt> construct works
correctly when <tt>&amp;sub</tt> happens to be
autoloaded.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&quot;&minus;bareword&quot;
allowed under &quot;use integer&quot;</b> <br>
The autoquoting of barewords preceded by
<tt>&quot;&minus;&quot;</tt> did not work in prior versions
when the <tt>&quot;integer&quot;</tt> pragma was enabled.
This has been fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Failures
in</b> <i><small>DESTROY</small> ()</i> <br>
When code in a destructor threw an exception, it went
unnoticed in earlier versions of Perl, unless someone
happened to be looking in $@ just after the point the
destructor happened to run. Such failures are now visible as
warnings when warnings are enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Locale bugs
fixed</b> <i><br>
printf()</i> and <i>sprintf()</i> previously reset the
numeric locale back to the default &quot;C&quot; locale.
This has been fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Numbers
formatted according to the local numeric locale (such as
using a decimal comma instead of a decimal dot) caused
&quot;isn&rsquo;t numeric&quot; warnings, even while the
operations accessing those numbers produced correct results.
These warnings have been discontinued.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Memory
leaks</b> <br>
The <tt>&quot;eval 'return sub {...}'&quot;</tt> construct
could sometimes leak memory. This has been fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Operations that
aren&rsquo;t filehandle constructors used to leak memory
when used on invalid filehandles. This has been fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Constructs that
modified <tt>@_</tt> could fail to deallocate values in
<tt>@_</tt> and thus leak memory. This has been
corrected.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Spurious
subroutine stubs after failed subroutine calls</b> <br>
Perl could sometimes create empty subroutine stubs when a
subroutine was not found in the package. Such cases stopped
later method lookups from progressing into base packages.
This has been corrected.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Taint
failures under &quot;&minus;U&quot;</b> <br>
When running in unsafe mode, taint violations could
sometimes cause silent failures. This has been fixed.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b><small>END</small>
blocks and the &quot;&minus;c&quot; switch</b> <br>
Prior versions used to run <small>BEGIN</small> <b>and</b>
<small>END</small> blocks when Perl was run in compile-only
mode. Since this is typically not the expected behavior,
<small>END</small> blocks are not executed anymore when the
<tt>&quot;&minus;c&quot;</tt> switch is used, or if
compilation fails.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">See
&quot;Support for <small>CHECK</small> blocks&quot; for how
to run things when the compile phase ends.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Potential to
leak <small>DATA</small> filehandles</b> <br>
Using the <tt>&quot;__DATA__&quot;</tt> token creates an
implicit filehandle to the file that contains the token. It
is the program&rsquo;s responsibility to close it when it is
done reading from it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This caveat is
now better explained in the documentation. See perldata.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;%s&quot;
variable %s masks earlier declaration in same %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W misc) A &quot;my&quot; or
&quot;our&quot; variable has been redeclared in the current
scope or statement, effectively eliminating all access to
the previous instance. This is almost always a typographical
error. Note that the earlier variable will still exist until
the end of the scope or until all closure referents to it
are destroyed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot;my sub&quot; not yet
implemented</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Lexically scoped
subroutines are not yet implemented. Don&rsquo;t try that
yet.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot;our&quot; variable %s
redeclared</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W misc) You seem to have
already declared the same global once before in the current
lexical scope.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&rsquo;!&rsquo; allowed only
after types %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The &rsquo;!&rsquo; is
allowed in <i>pack()</i> and <i>unpack()</i> only after
certain types. See &quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">/ cannot take a count</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You had an unpack template
indicating a counted-length string, but you have also
specified an explicit size for the string. See
&quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">/ must be followed by a, A or
Z</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You had an unpack template
indicating a counted-length string, which must be followed
by one of the letters a, A or Z to indicate what sort of
string is to be unpacked. See &quot;pack&quot; in
perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">/ must be followed by a*, A* or
Z*</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You had a pack template
indicating a counted-length string, Currently the only
things that can have their length counted are a*, A* or Z*.
See &quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">/ must follow a numeric
type</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You had an unpack template
that contained a &rsquo;#&rsquo;, but this did not follow
some numeric unpack specification. See &quot;pack&quot; in
perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">/%s/: Unrecognized escape \\%c
passed through</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W regexp) You used a
backslash-character combination which is not recognized by
Perl. This combination appears in an interpolated variable
or a <tt>&quot;'&quot;</tt>&minus;delimited regular
expression. The character was understood literally.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">/%s/: Unrecognized escape \\%c
in character class passed through</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W regexp) You used a
backslash-character combination which is not recognized by
Perl inside character classes. The character was understood
literally.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">/%s/ should probably be written
as &quot;%s&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W syntax) You have used a
pattern where Perl expected to find a string, as in the
first argument to <tt>&quot;join&quot;</tt>. Perl will treat
the true or false result of matching the pattern against
<tt>$_</tt> as the string, which is probably not what you
had in mind.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">%s() called too early to check
prototype</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W prototype) You&rsquo;ve
called a function that has a prototype before the parser saw
a definition or declaration for it, and Perl could not check
that the call conforms to the prototype. You need to either
add an early prototype declaration for the subroutine in
question, or move the subroutine definition ahead of the
call to get proper prototype checking. Alternatively, if you
are certain that you&rsquo;re calling the function
correctly, you may put an ampersand before the name to avoid
the warning. See perlsub.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">%s argument is not a
<small>HASH</small> or <small>ARRAY</small> element</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The argument to
<i>exists()</i> must be a hash or array element, such
as:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    $foo{$bar}
    $ref&minus;&gt;{&quot;susie&quot;}[12]</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%;">%s argument is not a
<small>HASH</small> or <small>ARRAY</small> element or
slice</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The argument to
<i>delete()</i> must be either a hash or array element, such
as:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    $foo{$bar}
    $ref&minus;&gt;{&quot;susie&quot;}[12]</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">or a hash or
array slice, such as:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    @foo[$bar, $baz, $xyzzy]
    @{$ref&minus;&gt;[12]}{&quot;susie&quot;, &quot;queue&quot;}</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%;">%s argument is not a subroutine
name</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The argument to
<i>exists()</i> for <tt>&quot;exists &amp;sub&quot;</tt>
must be a subroutine name, and not a subroutine call.
<tt>&quot;exists &amp;sub()&quot;</tt> will generate this
error.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">%s package attribute may clash
with future reserved word: %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W reserved) A lowercase
attribute name was used that had a package-specific handler.
That name might have a meaning to Perl itself some day, even
though it doesn&rsquo;t yet. Perhaps you should use a
mixed-case attribute name, instead. See attributes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">(in cleanup) %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W misc) This prefix usually
indicates that a <i><small>DESTROY</small> ()</i> method
raised the indicated exception. Since destructors are
usually called by the system at arbitrary points during
execution, and often a vast number of times, the warning is
issued only once for any number of failures that would
otherwise result in the same message being repeated.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Failure of user
callbacks dispatched using the
<tt>&quot;G_KEEPERR&quot;</tt> flag could also result in
this warning. See &quot;G_KEEPERR&quot; in perlcall.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&lt;&gt; should be quotes</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You wrote <tt>&quot;require
&lt;file&gt;&quot;</tt> when you should have written
<tt>&quot;require 'file'&quot;</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Attempt to join self</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You tried to join a thread
from within itself, which is an impossible task. You may be
joining the wrong thread, or you may need to move the
<i>join()</i> to some other thread.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Bad evalled substitution
pattern</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You&rsquo;ve used the /e
switch to evaluate the replacement for a substitution, but
perl found a syntax error in the code to evaluate, most
likely an unexpected right brace &rsquo;}&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Bad <i>realloc()</i>
ignored</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S) An internal routine called
<i>realloc()</i> on something that had never been
<i>malloc()</i>ed in the first place. Mandatory, but can be
disabled by setting environment variable
<tt>&quot;PERL_BADFREE&quot;</tt> to 1.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Bareword found in
conditional</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W bareword) The compiler found
a bareword where it expected a conditional, which often
indicates that an || or &amp;&amp; was parsed as part of the
last argument of the previous construct, for example:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    open FOO || die;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">It may also
indicate a misspelled constant that has been interpreted as
a bareword:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    use constant TYPO =&gt; 1;
    if (TYOP) { print &quot;foo&quot; }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The
<tt>&quot;strict&quot;</tt> pragma is useful in avoiding
such errors.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Binary number &gt;
0b11111111111111111111111111111111 non-portable</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W portable) The binary number
you specified is larger than 2**32&minus;1 (4294967295) and
therefore non-portable between systems. See perlport for
more on portability concerns.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Bit vector size &gt; 32
non-portable</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W portable) Using bit vector
sizes larger than 32 is non-portable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Buffer overflow in
prime_env_iter: %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W internal) A warning peculiar
to <small>VMS</small> . While Perl was preparing to iterate
over <tt>%ENV</tt>, it encountered a logical name or symbol
definition which was too long, so it was truncated to the
string shown.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t check filesystem of
script &quot;%s&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) For some reason you
can&rsquo;t check the filesystem of the script for
nosuid.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t declare class for
non-scalar %s in &quot;%s&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S) Currently, only scalar
variables can declared with a specific class qualifier in a
&quot;my&quot; or &quot;our&quot; declaration. The semantics
may be extended for other types of variables in future.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t declare %s in
&quot;%s&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Only scalar, array, and
hash variables may be declared as &quot;my&quot; or
&quot;our&quot; variables. They must have ordinary
identifiers as names.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t ignore signal
<small>CHLD</small> , forcing to default</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W signal) Perl has detected
that it is being run with the <small>SIGCHLD</small> signal
(sometimes known as <small>SIGCLD</small> ) disabled. Since
disabling this signal will interfere with proper
determination of exit status of child processes, Perl has
reset the signal to its default value. This situation
typically indicates that the parent program under which Perl
may be running (e.g., cron) is being very careless.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t modify non-lvalue
subroutine call</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Subroutines meant to be
used in lvalue context should be declared as such, see
&quot;Lvalue subroutines&quot; in perlsub.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t read
<small>CRTL</small> environ</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S) A warning peculiar to
<small>VMS</small> . Perl tried to read an element of
<tt>%ENV</tt> from the <small>CRTL</small> &rsquo;s internal
environment array and discovered the array was missing. You
need to figure out where your <small>CRTL</small> misplaced
its environ or define <i><small>PERL_ENV_TABLES</small></i>
(see perlvms) so that environ is not searched.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t remove %s: %s,
skipping file</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S) You requested an inplace
edit without creating a backup file. Perl was unable to
remove the original file to replace it with the modified
file. The file was left unmodified.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t return %s from
lvalue subroutine</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Perl detected an attempt to
return illegal lvalues (such as temporary or readonly
values) from a subroutine used as an lvalue. This is not
allowed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t weaken a
nonreference</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You attempted to weaken
something that was not a reference. Only references can be
weakened.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Character class [:%s:]
unknown</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The class in the character
class [: :] syntax is unknown. See perlre.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Character class syntax [%s]
belongs inside character classes</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W unsafe) The character class
constructs [: :], [= =], and [. .] go <i>inside</i>
character classes, the [] are part of the construct, for
example: /[012[:alpha:]345]/. Note that [= =] and [. .] are
not currently implemented; they are simply placeholders for
future extensions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Constant is not %s
reference</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) A constant value (perhaps
declared using the <tt>&quot;use constant&quot;</tt> pragma)
is being dereferenced, but it amounts to the wrong type of
reference. The message indicates the type of reference that
was expected. This usually indicates a syntax error in
dereferencing the constant value. See &quot;Constant
Functions&quot; in perlsub and constant.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">constant(%s): %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The parser found
inconsistencies either while attempting to define an
overloaded constant, or when trying to find the character
name specified in the <tt>&quot;\N{...}&quot;</tt> escape.
Perhaps you forgot to load the corresponding
<tt>&quot;overload&quot;</tt> or
<tt>&quot;charnames&quot;</tt> pragma? See charnames and
overload.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">CORE::%s is not a keyword</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The <small>CORE::</small>
namespace is reserved for Perl keywords.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">defined(@array) is
deprecated</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(D) <i>defined()</i> is not
usually useful on arrays because it checks for an undefined
<i>scalar</i> value. If you want to see if the array is
empty, just use <tt>&quot;if (@array) { # not empty
}&quot;</tt> for example.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">defined(%hash) is
deprecated</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(D) <i>defined()</i> is not
usually useful on hashes because it checks for an undefined
<i>scalar</i> value. If you want to see if the hash is
empty, just use <tt>&quot;if (%hash) { # not empty
}&quot;</tt> for example.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Did not produce a valid
header</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">See Server error.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">(Did you mean &quot;local&quot;
instead of &quot;our&quot;?)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W misc) Remember that
&quot;our&quot; does not localize the declared global
variable. You have declared it again in the same lexical
scope, which seems superfluous.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Document contains no data</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">See Server error.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">entering effective %s
failed</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) While under the
<tt>&quot;use filetest&quot;</tt> pragma, switching the real
and effective uids or gids failed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">false [] range &quot;%s&quot;
in regexp</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W regexp) A character class
range must start and end at a literal character, not another
character class like <tt>&quot;\d&quot;</tt> or
<tt>&quot;[:alpha:]&quot;</tt>. The &quot;&minus;&quot; in
your false range is interpreted as a literal
&quot;&minus;&quot;. Consider quoting the
&quot;&minus;&quot;, &quot;\&minus;&quot;. See perlre.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Filehandle %s opened only for
output</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W io) You tried to read from a
filehandle opened only for writing. If you intended it to be
a read/write filehandle, you needed to open it with
&quot;+&lt;&quot; or &quot;+&gt;&quot; or
&quot;+&gt;&gt;&quot; instead of with &quot;&lt;&quot; or
nothing. If you intended only to read from the file, use
&quot;&lt;&quot;. See &quot;open&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>flock()</i> on closed
filehandle %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W closed) The filehandle
you&rsquo;re attempting to <i>flock()</i> got itself closed
some time before now. Check your logic flow. <i>flock()</i>
operates on filehandles. Are you attempting to call
<i>flock()</i> on a dirhandle by the same name?</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Global symbol &quot;%s&quot;
requires explicit package name</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You&rsquo;ve said &quot;use
strict vars&quot;, which indicates that all variables must
either be lexically scoped (using &quot;my&quot;), declared
beforehand using &quot;our&quot;, or explicitly qualified to
say which package the global variable is in (using
&quot;::&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Hexadecimal number &gt;
0xffffffff non-portable</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W portable) The hexadecimal
number you specified is larger than 2**32&minus;1
(4294967295) and therefore non-portable between systems. See
perlport for more on portability concerns.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Ill-formed <small>CRTL</small>
environ value &quot;%s&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W internal) A warning peculiar
to <small>VMS</small> . Perl tried to read the
<small>CRTL</small> &rsquo;s internal environ array, and
encountered an element without the <tt>&quot;=&quot;</tt>
delimiter used to separate keys from values. The element is
ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Ill-formed message in
prime_env_iter: |%s|</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W internal) A warning peculiar
to <small>VMS</small> . Perl tried to read a logical name or
<small>CLI</small> symbol definition when preparing to
iterate over <tt>%ENV</tt>, and didn&rsquo;t see the
expected delimiter between key and value, so the line was
ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Illegal binary digit %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You used a digit other than
0 or 1 in a binary number.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Illegal binary digit %s
ignored</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W digit) You may have tried to
use a digit other than 0 or 1 in a binary number.
Interpretation of the binary number stopped before the
offending digit.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Illegal number of bits in
vec</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The number of bits in
<i>vec()</i> (the third argument) must be a power of two
from 1 to 32 (or 64, if your platform supports that).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Integer overflow in %s
number</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W overflow) The hexadecimal,
octal or binary number you have specified either as a
literal or as an argument to <i>hex()</i> or <i>oct()</i> is
too big for your architecture, and has been converted to a
floating point number. On a 32&minus;bit architecture the
largest hexadecimal, octal or binary number representable
without overflow is 0xFFFFFFFF, 037777777777, or
0b11111111111111111111111111111111 respectively. Note that
Perl transparently promotes all numbers to a floating point
representation internally--subject to loss of precision
errors in subsequent operations.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Invalid %s attribute: %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The indicated attribute for a
subroutine or variable was not recognized by Perl or by a
user-supplied handler. See attributes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Invalid %s attributes: %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The indicated attributes for a

<p style="margin-left:11%;">invalid [] range &quot;%s&quot;
in regexp</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The offending range is now
explicitly displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Invalid separator character %s
in attribute list</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Something other than a
colon or whitespace was seen between the elements of an
attribute list. If the previous attribute had a
parenthesised parameter list, perhaps that list was
terminated too soon. See attributes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Invalid separator character %s

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Lvalue subs returning %s not
implemented yet</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Due to limitations in the
current implementation, array and hash values cannot be
returned in subroutines used in lvalue context. See
&quot;Lvalue subroutines&quot; in perlsub.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Method %s not permitted</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">See Server error.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Missing %sbrace%s on \N{}</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Wrong syntax of character
name literal <tt>&quot;\N{charname}&quot;</tt> within
double-quotish context.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Missing command in piped
open</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W pipe) You used the
<tt>&quot;open(FH, &quot;| command&quot;)&quot;</tt> or
<tt>&quot;open(FH, &quot;command |&quot;)&quot;</tt>
construction, but the command was missing or blank.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Missing name in &quot;my
sub&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The reserved syntax for
lexically scoped subroutines requires that they have a name
with which they can be found.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">No %s specified for
&minus;%c</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The indicated command line
switch needs a mandatory argument, but you haven&rsquo;t
specified one.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">No package name allowed for
variable %s in &quot;our&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Fully qualified variable
names are not allowed in &quot;our&quot; declarations,
because that doesn&rsquo;t make much sense under existing
semantics. Such syntax is reserved for future
extensions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">No space allowed after
&minus;%c</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The argument to the
indicated command line switch must follow immediately after
the switch, without intervening spaces.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">no <small>UTC</small> offset
information; assuming local time is <small>UTC</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S) A warning peculiar to
<small>VMS</small> . Perl was unable to find the local
timezone offset, so it&rsquo;s assuming that local system
time is equivalent to <small>UTC</small> . If it&rsquo;s
not, define the logical name
<i><small>SYS$TIMEZONE_DIFFERENTIAL</small></i> to translate

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Possible unintended
interpolation of %s in string</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W ambiguous) It used to be
that Perl would try to guess whether you wanted an array
interpolated or a literal @. It no longer does this; arrays
are now <i>always</i> interpolated into strings. This means
that if you try something like:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">        print &quot;fred@example.com&quot;;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">and the array
<tt>@example</tt> doesn&rsquo;t exist, Perl is going to
print <tt>&quot;fred.com&quot;</tt>, which is probably not
what you wanted. To get a literal <tt>&quot;@&quot;</tt>

Incompatibilities</b> <br>
Beware that any new warnings that have been added or old
ones that have been enhanced are <b>not</b> considered
incompatible changes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Since all new
warnings must be explicitly requested via the
<tt>&quot;&minus;w&quot;</tt> switch or the
<tt>&quot;warnings&quot;</tt> pragma, it is ultimately the
programmer&rsquo;s responsibility to ensure that warnings
are enabled judiciously. <small><br>
CHECK</small> is a new keyword</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">All subroutine definitions
named <small>CHECK</small> are now special. See
<tt>&quot;/&quot;Support for CHECK blocks&quot;&quot;</tt>
for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Treatment of list slices of
undef has changed</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">There is a potential
incompatibility in the behavior of list slices that are
comprised entirely of undefined values. See &quot;Behavior
of list slices is more consistent&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Format of
$English::PERL_VERSION is different</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The English module now sets
<tt>$PERL_VERSION</tt> to $^V (a string value) rather than
<tt>$]</tt> (a numeric value). This is a potential
incompatibility. Send us a report via perlbug if you are
affected by this.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">See
&quot;Improved Perl version numbering system&quot; for the
reasons for this change.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Literals of the form 1.2.3
parse differently</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Previously, numeric literals
with more than one dot in them were interpreted as a
floating point number concatenated with one or more numbers.
Such &quot;numbers&quot; are now parsed as strings composed
of the specified ordinals.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">For example,
<tt>&quot;print 97.98.99&quot;</tt> used to output
<tt>97.9899</tt> in earlier versions, but now prints
<tt>&quot;abc&quot;</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">See
&quot;Support for strings represented as a vector of
ordinals&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Possibly changed pseudo-random
number generator</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Perl programs that depend on
reproducing a specific set of pseudo-random numbers may now
produce different output due to improvements made to the
<i>rand()</i> builtin. You can use <tt>&quot;sh Configure
&minus;Drandfunc=rand&quot;</tt> to obtain the old
behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">See
&quot;Better pseudo-random number generator&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Hashing function for hash keys
has changed</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Even though Perl hashes are not
order preserving, the apparently random order encountered
when iterating on the contents of a hash is actually
determined by the hashing algorithm used. Improvements in
the algorithm may yield a random order that is
<b>different</b> from that of previous versions, especially
when iterating on hashes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">See
&quot;Better worst-case behavior of hashes&quot; for

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot;undef&quot; fails on read
only values</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Using the
<tt>&quot;undef&quot;</tt> operator on a readonly value
(such as <tt>$1</tt>) has the same effect as assigning
<tt>&quot;undef&quot;</tt> to the readonly value--it throws
an exception.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Close-on-exec bit may be set on
pipe and socket handles</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Pipe and socket handles are
also now subject to the close-on-exec behavior determined by

consistent close-on-exec behavior&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Writing &quot;$$1&quot; to mean
&quot;${$}1&quot; is unsupported</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Perl 5.004 deprecated the
interpretation of <tt>$$1</tt> and similar within
interpolated strings to mean <tt>&quot;$$ .
&quot;1&quot;&quot;</tt>, but still allowed it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">In Perl 5.6.0

<tt>&quot;${$1}&quot;</tt>.</p>

<i>values()</i> and &quot;\(%h)&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">operate on aliases to values,
not copies</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><i>delete()</i>,
<i>each()</i>, <i>values()</i> and hashes (e.g.
<tt>&quot;\(%h)&quot;</tt>) in a list context return the
actual values in the hash, instead of copies (as they used
to in earlier versions). Typical idioms for using these
constructs copy the returned values, but this can make a
significant difference when creating references to the
returned values. Keys in the hash are still returned as
copies when iterating on a hash.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">See also
&quot;<i>delete()</i>, <i>each()</i>, <i>values()</i> and
hash iteration are faster&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">vec( <small>EXPR</small>
,OFFSET,BITS) enforces powers-of-two <small>BITS</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><i>vec()</i> generates a
run-time error if the <small>BITS</small> argument is not a
valid power-of-two integer.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Text of some diagnostic output
has changed</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Most references to internal
Perl operations in diagnostics have been changed to be more
descriptive. This may be an issue for programs that may
incorrectly rely on the exact text of diagnostics for proper
functioning.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot;%@&quot; has been
removed</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The undocumented special
variable <tt>&quot;%@&quot;</tt> that used to accumulate
&quot;background&quot; errors (such as those that happen in
<i><small>DESTROY</small> ()</i>) has been removed, because
it could potentially result in memory leaks.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Parenthesized <i>not()</i>
behaves like a list operator</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The <tt>&quot;not&quot;</tt>
operator now falls under the &quot;if it looks like a
function, it behaves like a function&quot; rule.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">As a result,
the parenthesized form can be used with
<tt>&quot;grep&quot;</tt> and <tt>&quot;map&quot;</tt>. The
following construct used to be a syntax error before, but it
works as expected now:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    grep not($_), @things;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">On the other
hand, using <tt>&quot;not&quot;</tt> with a literal list
slice may not work. The following previously allowed
construct:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    print not (1,2,3)[0];</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">needs to be
written with additional parentheses now:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    print not((1,2,3)[0]);</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The behavior
remains unaffected when <tt>&quot;not&quot;</tt> is not
followed by parentheses.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Semantics of bareword prototype
&quot;(*)&quot; have changed</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The semantics of the bareword
prototype <tt>&quot;*&quot;</tt> have changed. Perl 5.005
always coerced simple scalar arguments to a typeglob, which
wasn&rsquo;t useful in situations where the subroutine must
distinguish between a simple scalar and a typeglob. The new
behavior is to not coerce bareword arguments to a typeglob.
The value will always be visible as either a simple scalar
or as a reference to a typeglob.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">See &quot;More
functional bareword prototype (*)&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Semantics of bit operators may
have changed on 64&minus;bit platforms</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">If your platform is either
natively 64&minus;bit or if Perl has been configured to used
64&minus;bit integers, i.e., <tt>$Config</tt>{ivsize} is 8,
there may be a potential incompatibility in the behavior of
bitwise numeric operators (&amp; | ^ ~ &lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;).
These operators used to strictly operate on the lower 32
bits of integers in previous versions, but now operate over
the entire native integral width. In particular, note that
unary <tt>&quot;~&quot;</tt> will produce different results
on platforms that have different <tt>$Config</tt>{ivsize}.
For portability, be sure to mask off the excess bits in the
result of unary <tt>&quot;~&quot;</tt>, e.g., <tt>&quot;~$x
&amp; 0xffffffff&quot;</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">See &quot;Bit
operators support full native integer width&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">More builtins taint their
results</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">As described in &quot;Improved
security features&quot;, there may be more sources of taint
in a Perl program.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">To avoid these
new tainting behaviors, you can build Perl with the
Configure option
<tt>&quot;&minus;Accflags=&minus;DINCOMPLETE_TAINTS&quot;</tt>.
Beware that the ensuing perl binary may be insecure.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>C Source

&quot;PERL_POLLUTE&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Release 5.005 grandfathered old
global symbol names by providing preprocessor macros for
extension source compatibility. As of release 5.6.0, these
preprocessor definitions are not available by default. You
need to explicitly compile perl with
<tt>&quot;&minus;DPERL_POLLUTE&quot;</tt> to get these
definitions. For extensions still using the old symbols,
this option can be specified via MakeMaker:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    perl Makefile.PL POLLUTE=1</pre>



<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot;PERL_IMPLICIT_CONTEXT&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This new build option provides
a set of macros for all <small>API</small> functions such
that an implicit interpreter/thread context argument is
passed to every <small>API</small> function. As a result of
this, something like <tt>&quot;sv_setsv(foo,bar)&quot;</tt>
amounts to a macro invocation that actually translates to
something like
<tt>&quot;Perl_sv_setsv(my_perl,foo,bar)&quot;</tt>. While
this is generally expected to not have any significant
source compatibility issues, the difference between a macro
and a real function call will need to be considered.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This means that
there <b>is</b> a source compatibility issue as a result of
this if your extensions attempt to use pointers to any of
the Perl <small>API</small> functions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that the
above issue is not relevant to the default build of Perl,
whose interfaces continue to match those of prior versions
(but subject to the other options described here).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">See
&quot;Background and <small>PERL_IMPLICIT_CONTEXT</small>

    intended to be enabled by users at this time.</pre>



<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot;PERL_POLLUTE_MALLOC&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Enabling Perl&rsquo;s malloc in
release 5.005 and earlier caused the namespace of the
system&rsquo;s malloc family of functions to be usurped by
the Perl versions, since by default they used the same
names. Besides causing problems on platforms that do not
allow these functions to be cleanly replaced, this also
meant that the system versions could not be called in
programs that used Perl&rsquo;s malloc. Previous versions of
Perl have allowed this behaviour to be suppressed with the
<small>HIDEMYMALLOC</small> and <small>EMBEDMYMALLOC</small>
preprocessor definitions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">As of release
5.6.0, Perl&rsquo;s malloc family of functions have default
names distinct from the system versions. You need to
explicitly compile perl with
<tt>&quot;&minus;DPERL_POLLUTE_MALLOC&quot;</tt> to get the
older behaviour. <small>HIDEMYMALLOC</small> and
<small>EMBEDMYMALLOC</small> have no effect, since the
behaviour they enabled is now the default.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that these
functions do <b>not</b> constitute Perl&rsquo;s memory
allocation <small>API</small> . See &quot;Memory

&quot;PATCHLEVEL&quot; is now &quot;PERL_VERSION&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The cpp macros
<tt>&quot;PERL_REVISION&quot;</tt>,
<tt>&quot;PERL_VERSION&quot;</tt>, and
<tt>&quot;PERL_SUBVERSION&quot;</tt> are now available by
default from perl.h, and reflect the base revision,
patchlevel, and subversion respectively.
<tt>&quot;PERL_REVISION&quot;</tt> had no prior equivalent,
while <tt>&quot;PERL_VERSION&quot;</tt> and
<tt>&quot;PERL_SUBVERSION&quot;</tt> were previously
available as <tt>&quot;PATCHLEVEL&quot;</tt> and
<tt>&quot;SUBVERSION&quot;</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The new names
cause less pollution of the <b>cpp</b> namespace and reflect
what the numbers have come to stand for in common practice.
For compatibility, the old names are still supported when
<i>patchlevel.h</i> is explicitly included (as required
before), so there is no source incompatibility from the
change.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Binary
Incompatibilities</b> <br>
In general, the default build of this release is expected to
be binary compatible for extensions built with the 5.005
release or its maintenance versions. However, specific
platforms may have broken binary compatibility due to
changes in the defaults used in hints files. Therefore,
please be sure to always check the platform-specific
<small>README</small> files for any notes to the
contrary.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The usethreads
or usemultiplicity builds are <b>not</b> binary compatible
with the corresponding builds in 5.005.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On platforms
that require an explicit list of exports (
<small>AIX</small> , <small>OS/2</small> and Windows, among
others), purely internal symbols such as parser functions
and the run time opcodes are not exported by default. Perl
5.005 used to export all functions irrespective of whether
they were considered part of the public <small>API</small>
or not.</p>

<h2>Known Problems
<a name="Known Problems"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Thread test
failures</b> <br>
The subtests 19 and 20 of lib/thr5005.t test are known to
fail due to fundamental problems in the 5.005 threading
implementation. These are not new failures--Perl 5.005_0x
has the same bugs, but didn&rsquo;t have these tests.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b><small>EBCDIC</small>
platforms not supported</b> <br>
In earlier releases of Perl, <small>EBCDIC</small>
environments like <small>OS390</small> (also known as Open
Edition <small>MVS</small> ) and VM-ESA were supported. Due
to changes required by the <small>UTF&minus;8</small>
(Unicode) support, the <small>EBCDIC</small> platforms are
not supported in Perl 5.6.0.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>In
64&minus;bit HP-UX the lib/io_multihomed test may hang</b>
<br>
The lib/io_multihomed test may hang in HP-UX if Perl has
been configured to be 64&minus;bit. Because other
64&minus;bit platforms do not hang in this test, HP-UX is
suspect. All other tests pass in 64&minus;bit HP-UX. The
test attempts to create and connect to
&quot;multihomed&quot; sockets (sockets which have multiple
<small>IP</small> addresses).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b><small>NEXTSTEP</small>
3.3 <small>POSIX</small> test failure</b> <br>
In <small>NEXTSTEP</small> 3.3p2 the implementation of the
<i>strftime</i>(3) in the operating system libraries is
buggy: the <tt>%j</tt> format numbers the days of a month
starting from zero, which, while being logical to
programmers, will cause the subtests 19 to 27 of the
lib/posix test may fail.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Tru64 (aka
Digital <small>UNIX</small> , aka <small>DEC OSF/1</small> )
lib/sdbm test failure with gcc</b> <br>
If compiled with gcc 2.95 the lib/sdbm test will fail (dump
core). The cure is to use the vendor cc, it comes with the
operating system and produces good code.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>UNICOS/mk
<small>CC</small> failures during Configure run</b> <br>
In UNICOS/mk the following errors may appear during the
Configure run:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">        Guessing which symbols your C compiler and preprocessor define...
        CC&minus;20 cc: ERROR File = try.c, Line = 3
        ...
          bad switch yylook 79bad switch yylook 79bad switch yylook 79bad switch yylook 79#ifdef A29K
        ...
        4 errors detected in the compilation of &quot;try.c&quot;.</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The culprit is
the broken awk of UNICOS/mk. The effect is fortunately
rather mild: Perl itself is not adversely affected by the
error, only the h2ph utility coming with Perl, and that is
rather rarely needed these days.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Arrow
operator and arrays</b> <br>
When the left argument to the arrow operator
<tt>&quot;&minus;&gt;&quot;</tt> is an array, or the
<tt>&quot;scalar&quot;</tt> operator operating on an array,
the result of the operation must be considered erroneous.
For example:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    @x&minus;&gt;[2]
    scalar(@x)&minus;&gt;[2]</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These
expressions will get run-time errors in some future release
of Perl.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Experimental
features</b> <br>
As discussed above, many features are still experimental.
Interfaces and implementation of these features are subject
to change, and in extreme cases, even subject to removal in
some future release of Perl. These features include the
following: <br>
Threads <br>
Unicode <br>
64&minus;bit support <br>
Lvalue subroutines <br>
Weak references <br>
The pseudo-hash data type <br>
The Compiler suite <br>
Internal implementation of file globbing <br>
The <small>DB</small> module <br>
The regular expression code constructs:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><tt>&quot;(?{ code
})&quot;</tt> and <tt>&quot;(??{ code })&quot;</tt></p>

<h2>Obsolete Diagnostics
<a name="Obsolete Diagnostics"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Character class
syntax [: :] is reserved for future extensions</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W) Within regular expression
character classes ([]) the syntax beginning with
&quot;[:&quot; and ending with &quot;:]&quot; is reserved
for future extensions. If you need to represent those
character sequences inside a regular expression character
class, just quote the square brackets with the backslash:
&quot;\[:&quot; and &quot;:\]&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Ill-formed logical name |%s| in
prime_env_iter</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W) A warning peculiar to
<small>VMS</small> . A logical name was encountered when
preparing to iterate over <tt>%ENV</tt> which violates the
syntactic rules governing logical names. Because it cannot
be translated normally, it is skipped, and will not appear
in <tt>%ENV</tt>. This may be a benign occurrence, as some
software packages might directly modify logical name tables
and introduce nonstandard names, or it may indicate that a
logical name table has been corrupted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">In string, @%s now must be
written as \@%s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The description of this error
used to say:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">        (Someday it will simply assume that an unbackslashed @
         interpolates an array.)</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">That day has
come, and this fatal error has been removed. It has been
replaced by a non-fatal warning instead. See &quot;Arrays
now always interpolate into double-quoted strings&quot; for
details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Probable precedence problem on
%s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W) The compiler found a
bareword where it expected a conditional, which often
indicates that an || or &amp;&amp; was parsed as part of the
last argument of the previous construct, for example:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    open FOO || die;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%;">regexp too big</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The current implementation
of regular expressions uses shorts as address offsets within
a string. Unfortunately this means that if the regular
expression compiles to longer than 32767, it&rsquo;ll blow
up. Usually when you want a regular expression this big,
there is a better way to do it with multiple statements. See
perlre.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Use of
&quot;$$&lt;digit&gt;&quot; to mean
&quot;${$}&lt;digit&gt;&quot; is deprecated</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(D) Perl versions before 5.004
misinterpreted any type marker followed by &quot;$&quot; and
a digit. For example, &quot;$$0&quot; was incorrectly taken
to mean &quot;${$}0&quot; instead of &quot;${$0}&quot;. This
bug is (mostly) fixed in Perl 5.004.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">However, the
developers of Perl 5.004 could not fix this bug completely,
because at least two widely-used modules depend on the old
meaning of &quot;$$0&quot; in a string. So Perl 5.004 still
interprets &quot;$$&lt;digit&gt;&quot; in the old (broken)
way inside strings; but it generates this message as a
warning. And in Perl 5.005, this special treatment will
cease.</p>
