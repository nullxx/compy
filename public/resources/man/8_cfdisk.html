display or manipulate disk partition table</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>cfdisk</b>
[<b>&minus;agvz</b>] [<b>&minus;c</b> <i>cylinders</i>]
[<b>&minus;h</b> <i>heads</i>] [<b>&minus;s</b>
<i>sectors-per-track</i>] [<b>&minus;P</b> <i>opt</i>]
[<i>device</i>]</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>cfdisk</b>
is a curses-based program for partitioning any hard disk
drive. Typical values of the <i>device</i> argument are:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">/dev/hda
[default] <br>
/dev/hdb <br>
/dev/sda <br>
/dev/sdb <br>
/dev/sdc <br>
/dev/sdd</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
<b>cfdisk</b> does not align partitions to block device I/O
limits. This functionality is provided by
<b>fdisk</b>(8).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In order to
write the partition table <b>cfdisk</b> needs something
called the &lsquo;geometry&rsquo; of the disk: the number of
&lsquo;heads&rsquo; and the number of &lsquo;sectors per
track&rsquo;. Linux does not use any geometry, so if the
disk will not be accessed by other operating systems, you
can safely accept the defaults that <b>cfdisk</b> chooses
for you. The geometry used by <b>cfdisk</b> is found as
follows. First the partition table is examined, to see what
geometry was used by the previous program that changed it.
If the partition table is empty, or contains garbage, or
does not point at a consistent geometry, the kernel is asked
for advice. If nothing works 255 heads and 63 sectors/track
is assumed. The geometry can be overridden on the command
line or by use of the &lsquo;g&rsquo; command. When
partitioning an empty large modern disk, picking 255 heads
and 63 sectors/track is always a good idea. There is no need
to set the number of cylinders, since <b>cfdisk</b> knows
the disk size.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Next,
<b>cfdisk</b> tries to read the current partition table from
the disk drive. If it is unable to figure out the partition
table, an error is displayed and the program will exit. This
might also be caused by incorrect geometry information, and
can be overridden on the command line. Another way around
this problem is with the <b>&minus;z</b> option. This will
ignore the partition table on the disk.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The main
display is composed of four sections, from top to bottom:
the header, the partitions, the command line and a warning
line. The header contains the program name and version
number followed by the disk drive and its geometry. The
partitions section always displays the current partition
table. The command line is the place where commands and text
are entered. The available commands are usually displayed in
brackets. The warning line is usually empty except when
there is important information to be displayed. The current
partition is highlighted with reverse video (or an arrow if
the <b>&minus;a</b> option is given). All partition specific
commands apply to the current partition.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The format of
the partition table in the partitions section is, from left
to right: Name, Flags, Partition Type, Filesystem Type and
Size. The name is the partition device name. The flags can
be <i>Boot</i>, which designates a bootable partition or
<i>NC</i>, which stands for &quot;Not Compatible with DOS or
OS/2&quot;. DOS, OS/2 and possibly other operating systems
require the first sector of the first partition on the disk
and all logical partitions to begin on the second head. This
wastes the second through the last sector of the first track
of the first head (the first sector is taken by the
partition table itself). <b>cfdisk</b> allows you to recover
these &quot;lost&quot; sectors with the maximize command
(<b>m</b>). <i>Note:</i> <b>fdisk</b>(8) and some early
versions of DOS create all partitions with the number of
sectors already maximized. For more information, see the
maximize command below. The partition type can be one of
<i>Primary</i> or <i>Logical</i>. For unallocated space on
the drive, the partition type can also be <i>Pri/Log</i>, or
empty (if the space is unusable). The filesystem type
section displays the name of the filesystem used on the
partition, if known. If it is unknown, then <i>Unknown</i>
and the hex value of the filesystem type are displayed. A
special case occurs when there are sections of the disk
drive that cannot be used (because all of the primary
partitions are used). When this is detected, the filesystem
type is displayed as <i>Unusable</i>. The size field
displays the size of the partition in megabytes (by
default). It can also display the size in sectors and
cylinders (see the change units command below). If an
asterisk (<b>*</b>) appears after the size, this means that
the partition is not aligned on cylinder boundaries.</p>

<h2>DOS 6.x WARNING
<a name="DOS 6.x WARNING"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The DOS 6.x
FORMAT command looks for some information in the first
sector of the data area of the partition, and treats this
information as more reliable than the information in the
partition table. DOS FORMAT expects DOS FDISK to clear the
first 512 bytes of the data area of a partition whenever a
size change occurs. DOS FORMAT will look at this extra
information even if the /U flag is given -- we consider this
a bug in DOS FORMAT and DOS FDISK.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The bottom line
is that if you use cfdisk or fdisk to change the size of a
DOS partition table entry, then you must also use <b>dd</b>
to zero the first 512 bytes of that partition before using
DOS FORMAT to format the partition. For example, if you were
using cfdisk to make a DOS partition table entry for
/dev/hda1, then (after exiting fdisk or cfdisk and rebooting
Linux so that the partition table information is valid) you
would use the command &quot;dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/hda1
bs=512 count=1&quot; to zero the first 512 bytes of the
partition. Note:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>BE EXTREMELY
CAREFUL</b> if you use the <b>dd</b> command, since a small
typo can make all of the data on your disk useless.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For best
results, you should always use an OS-specific partition
table program. For example, you should make DOS partitions
with the DOS FDISK program and Linux partitions with the
Linux fdisk or Linux cfdisk program.</p>

<h2>COMMANDS
<a name="COMMANDS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>cfdisk</b>
commands can be entered by pressing the desired key
(pressing <i>Enter</i> after the command is not necessary).
Here is a list of the available commands:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"

<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p><b>b</b></p></td>
<td width="10%"></td>

<p>Toggle bootable flag of the current partition. This
allows you to select which primary partition is bootable on
the drive.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p><b>d</b></p></td>
<td width="10%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>Delete the current partition. This will convert the
current partition into free space and merge it with any free
space immediately surrounding the current partition. A
partition already marked as free space or marked as unusable
cannot be deleted.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p><b>g</b></p></td>
<td width="10%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>Change the disk geometry (cylinders, heads, or
sectors-per-track). <b>WARNING:</b> This option should only
be used by people who know what they are doing. A command
line option is also available to change the disk geometry.
While at the change disk geometry command line, you can
choose to change cylinders (<b>c</b>), heads (<b>h</b>), and
sectors per track (<b>s</b>). The default value will be
printed at the prompt which you can accept by simply
pressing the <i>Enter</i> key, or you can exit without
changes by pressing the <i>ESC</i> key. If you want to
change the default value, simply enter the desired value and
press <i>Enter</i>. The altered disk parameter values do not
take effect until you return to the main menu (by pressing
<i>Enter</i> or <i>ESC</i> at the change disk geometry
command line). If you change the geometry such that the disk
appears larger, the extra sectors are added at the end of
the disk as free space. If the disk appears smaller, the
partitions that are beyond the new last sector are deleted
and the last partition on the drive (or the free space at
the end of the drive) is made to end at the new last
sector.</p> </td></tr>

<td width="10%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>Maximize disk usage of the current partition. This
command will recover the unused space between the partition
table and the beginning of the partition, but at the cost of
making the partition incompatible with DOS, OS/2 and
possibly other operating systems. This option will toggle
between maximal disk usage and DOS, OS/2, etc. compatible
disk usage. The default when creating a partition is to
create DOS, OS/2, etc. compatible partitions.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p><b>n</b></p></td>
<td width="10%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>Create new partition from free space. If the partition
type is <i>Primary</i> or <i>Logical</i>, a partition of
that type will be created, but if the partition type is
<i>Pri/Log</i>, you will be prompted for the type you want
to create. Be aware that (1) there are only four slots
available for primary partitions and (2) since there can be
only one extended partition, which contains all of the
logical drives, all of the logical drives must be contiguous
(with no intervening primary partition). <b>cfdisk</b> next
prompts you for the size of the partition you want to
create. The default size, equal to the entire free space of
the current partition, is displayed in megabytes. You can
either press the <i>Enter</i> key to accept the default size
or enter a different size at the prompt. <b>cfdisk</b>
accepts size entries in megabytes (<b>M</b>) [default],
kilobytes (<b>K</b>), cylinders (<b>C</b>) and sectors
(<b>S</b>) by entering the number immediately followed by
one of (<b>M</b>, <b>K</b>, <b>C</b> or <b>S</b>). If the
partition fills the free space available, the partition is
created and you are returned to the main command line.
Otherwise, the partition can be created at the beginning or
the end of the free space, and <b>cfdisk</b> will ask you to
choose where to place the partition. After the partition is
created, <b>cfdisk</b> automatically adjusts the other
partitions&rsquo; partition types if all of the primary
partitions are used.</p></td></tr>

</table>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The <i>raw data
format</i> will print the sectors that would be written to
disk if a <b>w</b>rite command is selected. First, the
primary partition table is printed, followed by the
partition tables associated with each logical partition. The
data is printed in hex byte by byte with 16 bytes per
line.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>partition table in sector order format</i> will print the
partition table ordered by sector number. The fields, from
left to right, are the number of the partition, the
partition type, the first sector, the last sector, the
offset from the first sector of the partition to the start
of the data, the length of the partition, the filesystem
type (with the hex value in parenthesis), and the flags
(with the hex value in parenthesis). In addition to the
primary and logical partitions, free and unusable space is
printed and the extended partition is printed before the
first logical partition.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If a partition
does not start or end on a cylinder boundary or if the
partition length is not divisible by the cylinder size, an
asterisk (<b>*</b>) is printed after the non-aligned sector
number/count. This usually indicates that a partition was
created by an operating system that either does not align
partitions to cylinder boundaries or that used different
disk geometry information. If you know the disk geometry of
the other operating system, you could enter the geometry
information with the change geometry command (<b>g</b>).</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">For the first
partition on the disk and for all logical partitions, if the
offset from the beginning of the partition is not equal to
the number of sectors per track (i.e., the data does not
start on the first head), a number sign (<b>#</b>) is
printed after the offset. For the remaining partitions, if
the offset is not zero, a number sign will be printed after
the offset. This corresponds to the <i>NC</i> flag in the
partitions section of the main display.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>partition table in raw format</i> will print the
partition table ordered by partition number. It will leave
out all free and unusable space. The fields, from left to
right, are the number of the partition, the flags (in hex),
the starting head, sector and cylinder, the filesystem ID
(in hex), the ending head, sector and cylinder, the starting
sector in the partition and the number of sectors in the
partition. The information in this table can be directly
translated to the <i>raw data format</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The partition
table entries only have 10 bits available to represent the
starting and ending cylinders. Thus, when the absolute
starting (ending) sector number is on a cylinder greater
than 1023, the maximal values for starting (ending) head,
sector and cylinder are printed. This is the method used by
OS/2, and thus fixes the problems associated with
OS/2&rsquo;s fdisk rewriting the partition table when it is
not in this format. Since Linux and OS/2 use absolute sector
counts, the values in the starting and ending head, sector
and cylinder are not used.</p>
