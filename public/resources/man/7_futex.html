<h2>SYNOPSIS

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The Linux
kernel provides futexes (&quot;Fast user-space
mutexes&quot;) as a building block for fast user-space
locking and semaphores. Futexes are very basic and lend
themselves well for building higher level locking
abstractions such as POSIX mutexes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This page does
not set out to document all design decisions but restricts
itself to issues relevant for application and library
development. Most programmers will in fact not be using
futexes directly but instead rely on system libraries built
on them, such as the NPTL pthreads implementation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A futex is
identified by a piece of memory which can be shared between
different processes. In these different processes, it need
not have identical addresses. In its bare form, a futex has
semaphore semantics; it is a counter that can be incremented
and decremented atomically; processes can wait for the value
to become positive.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Futex operation
is entirely user space for the noncontended case. The kernel
is involved only to arbitrate the contended case. As any
sane design will strive for noncontention, futexes are also
optimized for this situation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In its bare
form, a futex is an aligned integer which is touched only by
atomic assembler instructions. Processes can share this
integer using <b>mmap</b>(2), via shared memory segments or
because they share memory space, in which case the
application is commonly called multithreaded.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Semantics</b>
<br>
Any futex operation starts in user space, but it may be
necessary to communicate with the kernel using the
<b>futex</b>(2) system call.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To
&quot;up&quot; a futex, execute the proper assembler
instructions that will cause the host CPU to atomically
increment the integer. Afterward, check if it has in fact
changed from 0 to 1, in which case there were no waiters and
the operation is done. This is the noncontended case which
is fast and should be common.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In the
contended case, the atomic increment changed the counter
from &minus;1 (or some other negative number). If this is
detected, there are waiters. User space should now set the
counter to 1 and instruct the kernel to wake up any waiters
using the <b>FUTEX_WAKE</b> operation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Waiting on a
futex, to &quot;down&quot; it, is the reverse operation.
Atomically decrement the counter and check if it changed to
0, in which case the operation is done and the futex was
uncontended. In all other circumstances, the process should
set the counter to &minus;1 and request that the kernel wait
for another process to up the futex. This is done using the
<b>FUTEX_WAIT</b> operation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>futex</b>(2) system call can optionally be passed a
timeout specifying how long the kernel should wait for the
futex to be upped. In this case, semantics are more complex
and the programmer is referred to <b>futex</b>(2) for more
details. The same holds for asynchronous futex waiting.</p>

<h2>VERSIONS
<a name="VERSIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Initial futex
support was merged in Linux 2.5.7 but with different
semantics from those described above. Current semantics are
available from Linux 2.5.40 onward.</p>

<h2>NOTES
<a name="NOTES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To reiterate,
bare futexes are not intended as an easy to use abstraction
for end-users. Implementors are expected to be assembly
literate and to have read the sources of the futex
user-space library referenced below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This man page
illustrates the most common use of the <b>futex</b>(2)
primitives: it is by no means the only one.</p>
