<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">alternate
object database</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Via the alternates mechanism, a
repository can inherit part of its object database from
another object database, which is called
&quot;alternate&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">bare
repository</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A bare repository is normally
an appropriately named directory with a .git suffix that
does not have a locally checked&minus;out copy of any of the
files under revision control. That is, all of the Git
administrative and control files that would normally be
present in the hidden .git sub&minus;directory are directly
present in the repository.git directory instead, and no
other files are present and checked out. Usually publishers
of public repositories make bare repositories available.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">blob object</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Untyped object, e.g. the
contents of a file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">branch</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A &quot;branch&quot; is an
active line of development. The most recent commit on a
branch is referred to as the tip of that branch. The tip of
the branch is referenced by a branch head, which moves
forward as additional development is done on the branch. A
single Git repository can track an arbitrary number of
branches, but your working tree is associated with just one
of them (the &quot;current&quot; or &quot;checked out&quot;
branch), and HEAD points to that branch.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">cache</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Obsolete for: index.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">chain</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A list of objects, where each
object in the list contains a reference to its successor
(for example, the successor of a commit could be one of its
parents).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">changeset</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">BitKeeper/cvsps speak for
&quot;commit&quot;. Since Git does not store changes, but
states, it really does not make sense to use the term
&quot;changesets&quot; with Git.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">checkout</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The action of updating all or
part of the working tree with a tree object or blob from the
object database, and updating the index and HEAD if the
whole working tree has been pointed at a new branch.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">cherry&minus;picking</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">In SCM jargon, &quot;cherry
pick&quot; means to choose a subset of changes out of a
series of changes (typically commits) and record them as a
new series of changes on top of a different codebase. In
Git, this is performed by the &quot;git
cherry&minus;pick&quot; command to extract the change
introduced by an existing commit and to record it based on
the tip of the current branch as a new commit.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">clean</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A working tree is clean, if it
corresponds to the revision referenced by the current head.
Also see &quot;dirty&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">commit</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">As a noun: A single point in
the Git history; the entire history of a project is
represented as a set of interrelated commits. The word
&quot;commit&quot; is often used by Git in the same places
other revision control systems use the words
&quot;revision&quot; or &quot;version&quot;. Also used as a
short hand for commit object.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">As a verb: The
action of storing a new snapshot of the project&rsquo;s
state in the Git history, by creating a new commit
representing the current state of the index and advancing
HEAD to point at the new commit.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">commit
object</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">An object which contains the
information about a particular revision, such as parents,
committer, author, date and the tree object which
corresponds to the top directory of the stored revision.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">core Git</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Fundamental data structures and
utilities of Git. Exposes only limited source code
management tools.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">DAG</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Directed acyclic graph. The
commit objects form a directed acyclic graph, because they
have parents (directed), and the graph of commit objects is
acyclic (there is no chain which begins and ends with the
same object).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">dangling
object</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">An unreachable object which is
not reachable even from other unreachable objects; a
dangling object has no references to it from any reference
or object in the repository.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">detached
HEAD</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Normally the HEAD stores the
name of a branch, and commands that operate on the history
HEAD represents operate on the history leading to the tip of
the branch the HEAD points at. However, Git also allows you
to check out an arbitrary commit that isn&rsquo;t
necessarily the tip of any particular branch. The HEAD in
such a state is called &quot;detached&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
commands that operate on the history of the current branch
(e.g. git commit to build a new history on top of it) still
work while the HEAD is detached. They update the HEAD to
point at the tip of the updated history without affecting
any branch. Commands that update or inquire information
<i>about</i> the current branch (e.g. git branch
&minus;&minus;set&minus;upstream&minus;to that sets what
remote tracking branch the current branch integrates with)
obviously do not work, as there is no (real) current branch
to ask about in this state.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">directory</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The list you get with
&quot;ls&quot; :&minus;)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">dirty</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A working tree is said to be
&quot;dirty&quot; if it contains modifications which have
not been committed to the current branch.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">evil merge</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">An evil merge is a merge that
introduces changes that do not appear in any parent.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">fast&minus;forward</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A fast&minus;forward is a
special type of merge where you have a revision and you are
&quot;merging&quot; another branch's changes that happen to
be a descendant of what you have. In such these cases, you
do not make a new mergecommit but instead just update to his
revision. This will happen frequently on a remote-tracking
branch of a remote repository.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">fetch</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Fetching a branch means to get
the branch&rsquo;s head ref from a remote repository, to
find out which objects are missing from the local object
database, and to get them, too. See also
<b>git-fetch</b>(1).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">file system</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Linus Torvalds originally
designed Git to be a user space file system, i.e. the
infrastructure to hold files and directories. That ensured
the efficiency and speed of Git.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Git archive</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Synonym for repository (for
arch people).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">gitfile</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A plain file .git at the root
of a working tree that points at the directory that is the
real repository.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">grafts</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Grafts enables two otherwise
different lines of development to be joined together by
recording fake ancestry information for commits. This way
you can make Git pretend the set of parents a commit has is
different from what was recorded when the commit was
created. Configured via the .git/info/grafts file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">hash</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">In Git&rsquo;s context, synonym
for object name.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">head</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A named reference to the commit
at the tip of a branch. Heads are stored in a file in
$GIT_DIR/refs/heads/ directory, except when using packed
refs. (See <b>git-pack-refs</b>(1).)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">HEAD</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The current branch. In more
detail: Your working tree is normally derived from the state
of the tree referred to by HEAD. HEAD is a reference to one
of the heads in your repository, except when using a
detached HEAD, in which case it directly references an
arbitrary commit.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">head ref</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A synonym for head.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">hook</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">During the normal execution of
several Git commands, call&minus;outs are made to optional
scripts that allow a developer to add functionality or
checking. Typically, the hooks allow for a command to be
pre&minus;verified and potentially aborted, and allow for a
post&minus;notification after the operation is done. The
hook scripts are found in the $GIT_DIR/hooks/ directory, and
are enabled by simply removing the .sample suffix from the
filename. In earlier versions of Git you had to make them
executable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">index</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A collection of files with stat
information, whose contents are stored as objects. The index
is a stored version of your working tree. Truth be told, it
can also contain a second, and even a third version of a
working tree, which are used when merging.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">index entry</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The information regarding a
particular file, stored in the index. An index entry can be
unmerged, if a merge was started, but not yet finished (i.e.
if the index contains multiple versions of that file).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">master</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The default development branch.
Whenever you create a Git repository, a branch named
&quot;master&quot; is created, and becomes the active
branch. In most cases, this contains the local development,
though that is purely by convention and is not required.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">merge</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">As a verb: To bring the
contents of another branch (possibly from an external
repository) into the current branch. In the case where the
merged&minus;in branch is from a different repository, this
is done by first fetching the remote branch and then merging
the result into the current branch. This combination of
fetch and merge operations is called a pull. Merging is
performed by an automatic process that identifies changes
made since the branches diverged, and then applies all those
changes together. In cases where changes conflict, manual
intervention may be required to complete the merge.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">As a noun:
unless it is a fast-forward, a successful merge results in
the creation of a new commit representing the result of the
merge, and having as parents the tips of the merged
branches. This commit is referred to as a &quot;merge
commit&quot;, or sometimes just a &quot;merge&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">object</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The unit of storage in Git. It
is uniquely identified by the SHA-1 of its contents.
Consequently, an object can not be changed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">object
database</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Stores a set of
&quot;objects&quot;, and an individual object is identified
by its object name. The objects usually live in
$GIT_DIR/objects/.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">object
identifier</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Synonym for object name.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">object name</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The unique identifier of an
object. The object name is usually represented by a 40
character hexadecimal string. Also colloquially called
SHA-1.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">object type</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">One of the identifiers
&quot;commit&quot;, &quot;tree&quot;, &quot;tag&quot; or
&quot;blob&quot; describing the type of an object.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">octopus</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">To merge more than two
branches.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">origin</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The default upstream
repository. Most projects have at least one upstream project
which they track. By default <i>origin</i> is used for that
purpose. New upstream updates will be fetched into remote
remote-tracking branches named
origin/name&minus;of&minus;upstream&minus;branch, which you
can see using git branch &minus;r.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">pack</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A set of objects which have
been compressed into one file (to save space or to transmit
them efficiently).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">pack index</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The list of identifiers, and
other information, of the objects in a pack, to assist in
efficiently accessing the contents of a pack.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">pathspec</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Pattern used to limit paths in
Git commands.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Pathspecs are
used on the command line of &quot;git ls&minus;files&quot;,
&quot;git ls&minus;tree&quot;, &quot;git add&quot;,
&quot;git grep&quot;, &quot;git diff&quot;, &quot;git
checkout&quot;, and many other commands to limit the scope
of operations to some subset of the tree or worktree. See
the documentation of each command for whether paths are
relative to the current directory or toplevel. The pathspec
syntax is as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; any path
matches itself</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; the
pathspec up to the last slash represents a directory prefix.
The scope of that pathspec is limited to that subtree.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; the rest
of the pathspec is a pattern for the remainder of the
pathname. Paths relative to the directory prefix will be
matched against that pattern using fnmatch(3); in
particular, <i>*</i> and <i>?can</i> match directory
separators.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">For example,
Documentation/*.jpg will match all .jpg files in the
Documentation subtree, including
Documentation/chapter_1/figure_1.jpg.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">A pathspec that
begins with a colon : has special meaning. In the short
form, the leading colon : is followed by zero or more
&quot;magic signature&quot; letters (which optionally is
terminated by another colon :), and the remainder is the
pattern to match against the path. The optional colon that
terminates the &quot;magic signature&quot; can be omitted if
the pattern begins with a character that cannot be a
&quot;magic signature&quot; and is not a colon.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">In the long
form, the leading colon : is followed by a open parenthesis
(, a comma&minus;separated list of zero or more &quot;magic
words&quot;, and a close parentheses ), and the remainder is
the pattern to match against the path.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The &quot;magic
signature&quot; consists of an ASCII symbol that is not
alphanumeric. Currently only the slash / is recognized as a
&quot;magic signature&quot;: it makes the pattern match from
the root of the working tree, even when you are running the
command from inside a subdirectory.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">A pathspec with
only a colon means &quot;there is no pathspec&quot;. This
form should not be combined with other pathspec.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">parent</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A commit object contains a
(possibly empty) list of the logical predecessor(s) in the
line of development, i.e. its parents.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">pickaxe</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The term pickaxe refers to an
option to the diffcore routines that help select changes
that add or delete a given text string. With the
&minus;&minus;pickaxe&minus;all option, it can be used to
view the full changeset that introduced or removed, say, a
particular line of text. See <b>git-diff</b>(1).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">plumbing</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Cute name for core Git.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">porcelain</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Cute name for programs and
program suites depending on core Git, presenting a high
level access to core Git. Porcelains expose more of a SCM
interface than the plumbing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">pull</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Pulling a branch means to fetch
it and merge it. See also <b>git-pull</b>(1).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">push</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Pushing a branch means to get
the branch&rsquo;s head ref from a remote repository, find
out if it is a direct ancestor to the branch&rsquo;s local
head ref, and in that case, putting all objects, which are
reachable from the local head ref, and which are missing
from the remote repository, into the remote object database,
and updating the remote head ref. If the remote head is not
an ancestor to the local head, the push fails.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">reachable</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">All of the ancestors of a given
commit are said to be &quot;reachable&quot; from that
commit. More generally, one object is reachable from another
if we can reach the one from the other by a chain that
follows tags to whatever they tag, commits to their parents
or trees, and trees to the trees or blobs that they
contain.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">rebase</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">To reapply a series of changes
from a branch to a different base, and reset the head of
that branch to the result.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">ref</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A 40&minus;byte hex
representation of a SHA-1 or a name that denotes a
particular object. They may be stored in a file under
$GIT_DIR/refs/ directory, or in the
$GIT_DIR/packed&minus;refs file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">reflog</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A reflog shows the local
&quot;history&quot; of a ref. In other words, it can tell
you what the 3rd last revision in <i>this</i> repository
was, and what was the current state in <i>this</i>
repository, yesterday 9:14pm. See <b>git-reflog</b>(1) for
details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">refspec</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A &quot;refspec&quot; is used
by fetch and push to describe the mapping between remote ref
and local ref.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">remote&minus;tracking
branch</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A regular Git branch that is
used to follow changes from another repository. A
remote&minus;tracking branch should not contain direct
modifications or have local commits made to it. A
remote&minus;tracking branch can usually be identified as
the right&minus;hand&minus;side ref in a Pull: refspec.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">repository</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A collection of refs together
with an object database containing all objects which are
reachable from the refs, possibly accompanied by meta data
from one or more porcelains. A repository can share an
object database with other repositories via alternates
mechanism.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">resolve</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The action of fixing up
manually what a failed automatic merge left behind.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">revision</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Synonym for commit (the
noun).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">rewind</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">To throw away part of the
development, i.e. to assign the head to an earlier
revision.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">SCM</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Source code management
(tool).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">SHA&minus;1</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">&quot;Secure Hash Algorithm
1&quot;; a cryptographic hash function. In the context of
Git used as a synonym for object name.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">shallow
repository</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A shallow repository has an
incomplete history some of whose commits have parents
cauterized away (in other words, Git is told to pretend that
these commits do not have the parents, even though they are
recorded in the commit object). This is sometimes useful
when you are interested only in the recent history of a
project even though the real history recorded in the
upstream is much larger. A shallow repository is created by
giving the &minus;&minus;depth option to
<b>git-clone</b>(1), and its history can be later deepened
with <b>git-fetch</b>(1).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">symref</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Symbolic reference: instead of
containing the SHA-1 id itself, it is of the format <i>ref:
refs/some/thing</i> and when referenced, it recursively
dereferences to this reference. <i>HEAD</i> is a prime
example of a symref. Symbolic references are manipulated
with the <b>git-symbolic-ref</b>(1) command.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">tag</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A ref under refs/tags/
namespace that points to an object of an arbitrary type
(typically a tag points to either a tag or a commit object).
In contrast to a head, a tag is not updated by the commit
command. A Git tag has nothing to do with a Lisp tag (which
would be called an object type in Git&rsquo;s context). A
tag is most typically used to mark a particular point in the
commit ancestry chain.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">tag object</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">An object containing a ref
pointing to another object, which can contain a message just
like a commit object. It can also contain a (PGP) signature,
in which case it is called a &quot;signed tag
object&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">topic
branch</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A regular Git branch that is
used by a developer to identify a conceptual line of
development. Since branches are very easy and inexpensive,
it is often desirable to have several small branches that
each contain very well defined concepts or small incremental
yet related changes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">tree</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Either a working tree, or a
tree object together with the dependent blob and tree
objects (i.e. a stored representation of a working
tree).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">tree object</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">An object containing a list of
file names and modes along with refs to the associated blob
and/or tree objects. A tree is equivalent to a
directory.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">tree&minus;ish</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A ref pointing to either a
commit object, a tree object, or a tag object pointing to a
tag or commit or tree object.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">unmerged
index</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">An index which contains
unmerged index entries.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">unreachable
object</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">An object which is not
reachable from a branch, tag, or any other reference.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">upstream
