Git command line interface and conventions</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">gitcli</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This manual
describes the convention used throughout Git CLI.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Many commands
take revisions (most often &quot;commits&quot;, but
sometimes &quot;tree&minus;ish&quot;, depending on the
context and command) and paths as their arguments. Here are
the rules:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
Revisions come first and then paths. E.g. in git diff v1.0
v2.0 arch/x86 include/asm&minus;x86, v1.0 and v2.0 are
revisions and arch/x86 and include/asm&minus;x86 are
paths.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; When an
argument can be misunderstood as either a revision or a
path, they can be disambiguated by placing &minus;&minus;
between them. E.g. git diff &minus;&minus; HEAD is, &quot;I
have a file called HEAD in my work tree. Please show changes
between the version I staged in the index and what I have in
the work tree for that file&quot;. not &quot;show difference
between the HEAD commit and the work tree as a whole&quot;.
You can say git diff HEAD &minus;&minus; to ask for the
latter.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; Without
disambiguating &minus;&minus;, Git makes a reasonable guess,
but errors out and asking you to disambiguate when
ambiguous. E.g. if you have a file called HEAD in your work
tree, git diff HEAD is ambiguous, and you have to say either
git diff HEAD &minus;&minus; or git diff &minus;&minus; HEAD
to disambiguate.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">When writing a
script that is expected to handle random user&minus;input,
it is a good practice to make it explicit which arguments
are which by placing disambiguating &minus;&minus; at
appropriate places.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; Many
commands allow wildcards in paths, but you need to protect
them from getting globbed by the shell. These two mean
different things:</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">$ git checkout
&minus;&minus; *.c <br>
$ git checkout &minus;&minus; \*.c</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The former lets
your shell expand the fileglob, and you are asking the
dot&minus;C files in your working tree to be overwritten
with the version in the index. The latter passes the *.c to
Git, and you are asking the paths in the index that match
the pattern to be checked out to your working tree. After
running git add hello.c; rm hello.c, you will <i>not</i> see
hello.c in your working tree with the former, but with the
latter you will.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Here are the
rules regarding the &quot;flags&quot; that you should follow
when you are scripting Git:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
it&rsquo;s preferred to use the non dashed form of Git
commands, which means that you should prefer git foo to
git&minus;foo.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
splitting short options to separate words (prefer git foo
&minus;a &minus;b to git foo &minus;ab, the latter may not
even work).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; when a
command line option takes an argument, use the
<i>sticked</i> form. In other words, write git foo
&minus;oArg instead of git foo &minus;o Arg for short
options, and git foo &minus;&minus;long&minus;opt=Arg
instead of git foo &minus;&minus;long&minus;opt Arg for long
options. An option that takes optional option&minus;argument
must be written in the <i>sticked</i> form.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; when you
give a revision parameter to a command, make sure the
parameter is not ambiguous with a name of a file in the work
tree. E.g. do not write git log &minus;1 HEAD but write git
log &minus;1 HEAD &minus;&minus;; the former will not work
if you happen to have a file called HEAD in the work
tree.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; many
commands allow a long option
&quot;&minus;&minus;option&quot; to be abbreviated only to
their unique prefix (e.g. if there is no other option whose
name begins with &quot;opt&quot;, you may be able to spell
&quot;&minus;&minus;opt&quot; to invoke the
&quot;&minus;&minus;option&quot; flag), but you should fully
spell them out when writing your scripts; later versions of
Git may introduce a new option whose name shares the same
prefix, e.g. &quot;&minus;&minus;optimize&quot;, to make a
short prefix that used to be unique no longer unique.</p>

<h2>ENHANCED OPTION PARSER
<a name="ENHANCED OPTION PARSER"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">From the Git
1.5.4 series and further, many Git commands (not all of them
at the time of the writing though) come with an enhanced
option parser.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Here is a list
of the facilities provided by this option parser.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Magic
Options</b> <br>
Commands which have the enhanced option parser activated all
understand a couple of magic command line options:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;h</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">gives a pretty printed usage of
the command.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">$ git describe
&minus;h <br>
usage: git describe [options] &lt;committish&gt;* <br>
or: git describe [options] &minus;&minus;dirty</p>


<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;contains
find the tag that comes after the commit <br>
&minus;&minus;debug debug search strategy on stderr <br>
&minus;&minus;all use any ref <br>
&minus;&minus;tags use any tag, even unannotated <br>
&minus;&minus;long always use long format <br>
&minus;&minus;abbrev[=&lt;n&gt;] use &lt;n&gt; digits to
display SHA&minus;1s</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;help&minus;all</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Some Git commands take options
that are only used for plumbing or that are deprecated, and
such options are hidden from the default usage. This option
gives the full list of options.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Negating
options</b> <br>
Options with long option names can be negated by prefixing
&minus;&minus;no&minus;. For example, git branch has the
option &minus;&minus;track which is <i>on</i> by default.
You can use &minus;&minus;no&minus;track to override that
behaviour. The same goes for &minus;&minus;color and
&minus;&minus;no&minus;color.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Aggregating
short options</b> <br>
Commands that support the enhanced option parser allow you
to aggregate short options. This means that you can for
example use git rm &minus;rf or git clean &minus;fdx.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Abbreviating
long options</b> <br>
Commands that support the enhanced option parser accepts
unique prefix of a long option as if it is fully spelled
out, but use this with a caution. For example, git commit
&minus;&minus;amen behaves as if you typed git commit
&minus;&minus;amend, but that is true only until a later
version of Git introduces another option that shares the
same prefix, e.g &lsquo;git commit
&minus;&minus;amenity&quot; option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Separating
argument from the option</b> <br>
You can write the mandatory option parameter to an option as
a separate word on the command line. That means that all the
following uses work:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">$ git foo
&minus;&minus;long&minus;opt=Arg <br>
$ git foo &minus;&minus;long&minus;opt Arg <br>
$ git foo &minus;oArg <br>
$ git foo &minus;o Arg</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">However, this
is <b>NOT</b> allowed for switches with an optional value,
where the <i>sticked</i> form must be used:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">$ git describe
&minus;&minus;abbrev HEAD # correct <br>
$ git describe &minus;&minus;abbrev=10 HEAD # correct <br>
$ git describe &minus;&minus;abbrev 10 HEAD # NOT WHAT YOU
MEANT</p>

<h2>NOTES ON FREQUENTLY CONFUSED OPTIONS
<a name="NOTES ON FREQUENTLY CONFUSED OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Many commands
that can work on files in the working tree and/or in the
index can take &minus;&minus;cached and/or
&minus;&minus;index options. Sometimes people incorrectly
think that, because the index was originally called cache,
these two are synonyms. They are <b>not</b> &mdash; these
two options mean very different things.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; The
&minus;&minus;cached option is used to ask a command that
usually works on files in the working tree to <b>only</b>
work with the index. For example, git grep, when used
without a commit to specify from which commit to look for
strings in, usually works on files in the working tree, but
with the &minus;&minus;cached option, it looks for strings
in the index.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; The
&minus;&minus;index option is used to ask a command that
usually works on files in the working tree to <b>also</b>
affect the index. For example, git stash apply usually
merges changes recorded in a stash to the working tree, but
with the &minus;&minus;index option, it also merges changes
to the index as well.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">git apply
command can be used with &minus;&minus;cached and
&minus;&minus;index (but not at the same time). Usually the
command only affects the files in the working tree, but with
&minus;&minus;index, it patches both the files and their
index entries, and with &minus;&minus;cached, it modifies
only the index entries.</p>
