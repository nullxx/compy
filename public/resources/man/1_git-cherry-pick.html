<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">git-cherry-pick
&minus; Apply the changes introduced by some existing
commits</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>git
cherry&minus;pick</i> [&minus;&minus;edit] [&minus;n]
[&minus;m parent&minus;number] [&minus;s] [&minus;x]

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Given one or
more existing commits, apply the change each one introduces,
recording a new commit for each. This requires your working
tree to be clean (no modifications from the HEAD
commit).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When it is not
obvious how to apply a change, the following happens:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">1. The current
branch and HEAD pointer stay at the last commit successfully
made.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">2. The
CHERRY_PICK_HEAD ref is set to point at the commit that
introduced the change that is difficult to apply.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">3. Paths in
which the change applied cleanly are updated both in the
index file and in your working tree.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">4. For
conflicting paths, the index file records up to three
versions, as described in the &quot;TRUE MERGE&quot; section
of <b>git-merge</b>(1). The working tree files will include
a description of the conflict bracketed by the usual
conflict markers &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">5. No other
modifications are made.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">See
<b>git-merge</b>(1) for some hints on resolving such
conflicts.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&lt;commit&gt;...</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Commits to cherry&minus;pick.
For a more complete list of ways to spell commits, see
<b>gitrevisions</b>(7). Sets of commits can be passed but no
traversal is done by default, as if the
<i>&minus;&minus;no&minus;walk</i> option was specified, see
<b>git-rev-list</b>(1). Note that specifying a range will
feed all &lt;commit&gt;... arguments to a single revision
walk (see a later example that uses <i>maint
master..next</i>).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;e,
&minus;&minus;edit</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">With this option, <i>git
cherry&minus;pick</i> will let you edit the commit message
prior to committing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;x</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When recording the commit,
append a line that says &quot;(cherry picked from commit
...)&quot; to the original commit message in order to
indicate which commit this change was cherry&minus;picked
from. This is done only for cherry picks without conflicts.
Do not use this option if you are cherry&minus;picking from
your private branch because the information is useless to
the recipient. If on the other hand you are
cherry&minus;picking between two publicly visible branches
(e.g. backporting a fix to a maintenance branch for an older
release from a development branch), adding this information
can be useful.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;r</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">It used to be that the command
defaulted to do &minus;x described above, and &minus;r was
to disable it. Now the default is not to do &minus;x so this
option is a no&minus;op.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;m
parent&minus;number, &minus;&minus;mainline
parent&minus;number</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Usually you cannot
cherry&minus;pick a merge because you do not know which side
of the merge should be considered the mainline. This option
specifies the parent number (starting from 1) of the
mainline and allows cherry&minus;pick to replay the change
relative to the specified parent.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;n,
&minus;&minus;no&minus;commit</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Usually the command
automatically creates a sequence of commits. This flag
applies the changes necessary to cherry&minus;pick each
named commit to your working tree and the index, without
making any commit. In addition, when this option is used,
your index does not have to match the HEAD commit. The
cherry&minus;pick is done against the beginning state of
your index.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This is useful
when cherry&minus;picking more than one commits' effect to
your index in a row.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;s,
&minus;&minus;signoff</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Add Signed&minus;off&minus;by
line at the end of the commit message.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;ff</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">If the current HEAD is the same
as the parent of the cherry&minus;pick&rsquo;ed commit, then
a fast forward to this commit will be performed.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;allow&minus;empty</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">By default,
cherry&minus;picking an empty commit will fail, indicating
that an explicit invocation of git commit
&minus;&minus;allow&minus;empty is required. This option
overrides that behavior, allowing empty commits to be
preserved automatically in a cherry&minus;pick. Note that
when &quot;&minus;&minus;ff&quot; is in effect, empty
commits that meet the &quot;fast&minus;forward&quot;
requirement will be kept even without this option. Note
also, that use of this option only keeps commits that were
initially empty (i.e. the commit recorded the same tree as
its parent). Commits which are made empty due to a previous
commit are dropped. To force the inclusion of those commits
use &minus;&minus;keep&minus;redundant&minus;commits.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;allow&minus;empty&minus;message</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">By default,
cherry&minus;picking a commit with an empty message will
fail. This option overrides that behaviour, allowing commits
with empty messages to be cherry picked.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;keep&minus;redundant&minus;commits</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">If a commit being cherry picked
duplicates a commit already in the current history, it will
become empty. By default these redundant commits are
ignored. This option overrides that behavior and creates an
empty commit object. Implies
&minus;&minus;allow&minus;empty.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;strategy=&lt;strategy&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Use the given merge strategy.
Should only be used once. See the MERGE STRATEGIES section
in <b>git-merge</b>(1) for details.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;X&lt;option&gt;,
&minus;&minus;strategy&minus;option=&lt;option&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Pass the merge
strategy&minus;specific option through to the merge
strategy. See <b>git-merge</b>(1) for details.</p>

<a name="SEQUENCER SUBCOMMANDS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;continue</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Continue the operation in
progress using the information in <i>.git/sequencer</i>. Can
be used to continue after resolving conflicts in a failed
cherry&minus;pick or revert.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;quit</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Forget about the current
operation in progress. Can be used to clear the sequencer
state after a failed cherry&minus;pick or revert.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;abort</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Cancel the operation and return
to the pre&minus;sequence state.</p>

<h2>EXAMPLES
<a name="EXAMPLES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">git
cherry&minus;pick master</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Apply the change introduced by
the commit at the tip of the master branch and create a new
commit with this change.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">git
cherry&minus;pick ..master, git cherry&minus;pick ^HEAD
master</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Apply the changes introduced by
all commits that are ancestors of master but not of HEAD to
produce new commits.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">git
cherry&minus;pick maint next ^master, git cherry&minus;pick
maint master..next</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Apply the changes introduced by
all commits that are ancestors of maint or next, but not
master or any of its ancestors. Note that the latter does
not mean maint and everything between master and next;
specifically, maint will not be used if it is included in
master.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">git
cherry&minus;pick master~4 master~2</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Apply the changes introduced by
the fifth and third last commits pointed to by master and
create 2 new commits with these changes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">git
cherry&minus;pick &minus;n master~1 next</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Apply to the working tree and
the index the changes introduced by the second last commit
pointed to by master and by the last commit pointed to by
next, but do not create any commit with these changes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">git
cherry&minus;pick &minus;&minus;ff ..next</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">If history is linear and HEAD
is an ancestor of next, update the working tree and advance
the HEAD pointer to match next. Otherwise, apply the changes
introduced by those commits that are in next but not HEAD to
the current branch, creating a new commit for each new
change.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">git
rev&minus;list &minus;&minus;reverse master &minus;&minus;
README | git cherry&minus;pick &minus;n
&minus;&minus;stdin</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Apply the changes introduced by
all commits on the master branch that touched README to the
working tree and index, so the result can be inspected and
made into a single new commit if suitable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
sequence attempts to backport a patch, bails out because the
code the patch applies to has changed too much, and then
tries again, this time exercising more care about matching
up context lines.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">$ git
cherry&minus;pick topic^ <b>(1)</b> <br>
$ git diff <b>(2)</b> <br>
$ git reset &minus;&minus;merge ORIG_HEAD <b>(3)</b> <br>
$ git cherry&minus;pick &minus;Xpatience topic^
<b>(4)</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>1.</b> apply
the change that would be shown by git show topic^. In this
example, the patch does not apply cleanly, so information
about the conflict is written to the index and working tree
and no new commit results. <b><br>
2.</b> summarize changes to be reconciled <b><br>
3.</b> cancel the cherry&minus;pick. In other words, return
to the pre&minus;cherry&minus;pick state, preserving any
local modifications you had in the working tree. <b><br>
4.</b> try to apply the change introduced by topic^ again,
spending extra time to avoid mistakes based on incorrectly
matching context lines.</p>
