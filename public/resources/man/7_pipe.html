overview of pipes and FIFOs</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Pipes and FIFOs
(also known as named pipes) provide a unidirectional
interprocess communication channel. A pipe has a <i>read
end</i> and a <i>write end</i>. Data written to the write
end of a pipe can be read from the read end of the pipe.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A pipe is
created using <b>pipe</b>(2), which creates a new pipe and
returns two file descriptors, one referring to the read end
of the pipe, the other referring to the write end. Pipes can
be used to create a communication channel between related
processes; see <b>pipe</b>(2) for an example.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A FIFO (short
for First In First Out) has a name within the file system
(created using <b>mkfifo</b>(3)), and is opened using
<b>open</b>(2). Any process may open a FIFO, assuming the
file permissions allow it. The read end is opened using the
<b>O_RDONLY</b> flag; the write end is opened using the
<b>O_WRONLY</b> flag. See <b>fifo</b>(7) for further
details. <i>Note</i>: although FIFOs have a pathname in the
file system, I/O on FIFOs does not involve operations on the
underlying device (if there is one).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>I/O on pipes
and FIFOs</b> <br>
The only difference between pipes and FIFOs is the manner in
which they are created and opened. Once these tasks have
been accomplished, I/O on pipes and FIFOs has exactly the
same semantics.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If a process
attempts to read from an empty pipe, then <b>read</b>(2)
will block until data is available. If a process attempts to
write to a full pipe (see below), then <b>write</b>(2)
blocks until sufficient data has been read from the pipe to
allow the write to complete. Nonblocking I/O is possible by
using the <b>fcntl</b>(2) <b>F_SETFL</b> operation to enable
the <b>O_NONBLOCK</b> open file status flag.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
communication channel provided by a pipe is a <i>byte
stream</i>: there is no concept of message boundaries.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If all file
descriptors referring to the write end of a pipe have been
closed, then an attempt to <b>read</b>(2) from the pipe will
see end-of-file (<b>read</b>(2) will return 0). If all file
descriptors referring to the read end of a pipe have been
closed, then a <b>write</b>(2) will cause a <b>SIGPIPE</b>
signal to be generated for the calling process. If the
calling process is ignoring this signal, then
<b>write</b>(2) fails with the error <b>EPIPE</b>. An
application that uses <b>pipe</b>(2) and <b>fork</b>(2)
should use suitable <b>close</b>(2) calls to close
unnecessary duplicate file descriptors; this ensures that
end-of-file and <b>SIGPIPE</b>/<b>EPIPE</b> are delivered
when appropriate.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is not
possible to apply <b>lseek</b>(2) to a pipe.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Pipe
capacity</b> <br>
A pipe has a limited capacity. If the pipe is full, then a
<b>write</b>(2) will block or fail, depending on whether the
<b>O_NONBLOCK</b> flag is set (see below). Different
implementations have different limits for the pipe capacity.
Applications should not rely on a particular capacity: an
application should be designed so that a reading process
consumes data as soon as it is available, so that a writing
process does not remain blocked.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In Linux
versions before 2.6.11, the capacity of a pipe was the same
as the system page size (e.g., 4096 bytes on i386). Since
Linux 2.6.11, the pipe capacity is 65536 bytes.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>PIPE_BUF</b>
<br>
POSIX.1-2001 says that <b>write</b>(2)s of less than
<b>PIPE_BUF</b> bytes must be atomic: the output data is
written to the pipe as a contiguous sequence. Writes of more
than <b>PIPE_BUF</b> bytes may be nonatomic: the kernel may
interleave the data with data written by other processes.
POSIX.1-2001 requires <b>PIPE_BUF</b> to be at least 512
bytes. (On Linux, <b>PIPE_BUF</b> is 4096 bytes.) The
precise semantics depend on whether the file descriptor is
nonblocking (<b>O_NONBLOCK</b>), whether there are multiple
writers to the pipe, and on <i>n</i>, the number of bytes to
be written: <b><br>
O_NONBLOCK</b> disabled, <i>n</i> &lt;= <b>PIPE_BUF</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">All <i>n</i> bytes are written
atomically; <b>write</b>(2) may block if there is not room
for <i>n</i> bytes to be written immediately</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>O_NONBLOCK</b> enabled,
<i>n</i> &lt;= <b>PIPE_BUF</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If there is room to write
<i>n</i> bytes to the pipe, then <b>write</b>(2) succeeds
immediately, writing all <i>n</i> bytes; otherwise
<b>write</b>(2) fails, with <i>errno</i> set to
<b>EAGAIN</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>O_NONBLOCK</b> disabled,
<i>n</i> &gt; <b>PIPE_BUF</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The write is nonatomic: the
data given to <b>write</b>(2) may be interleaved with
<b>write</b>(2)s by other process; the <b>write</b>(2)
blocks until <i>n</i> bytes have been written.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>O_NONBLOCK</b> enabled,
<i>n</i> &gt; <b>PIPE_BUF</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If the pipe is full, then
<b>write</b>(2) fails, with <i>errno</i> set to
<b>EAGAIN</b>. Otherwise, from 1 to <i>n</i> bytes may be
written (i.e., a &quot;partial write&quot; may occur; the
caller should check the return value from <b>write</b>(2) to
see how many bytes were actually written), and these bytes
may be interleaved with writes by other processes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Open file
status flags</b> <br>
The only open file status flags that can be meaningfully
applied to a pipe or FIFO are <b>O_NONBLOCK</b> and
<b>O_ASYNC</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Setting the
<b>O_ASYNC</b> flag for the read end of a pipe causes a
signal (<b>SIGIO</b> by default) to be generated when new
input becomes available on the pipe (see <b>fcntl</b>(2) for
details). On Linux, <b>O_ASYNC</b> is supported for pipes
and FIFOs only since kernel 2.6.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Portability
notes</b> <br>
On some systems (but not Linux), pipes are bidirectional:
data can be transmitted in both directions between the pipe
ends. According to POSIX.1-2001, pipes only need to be
unidirectional. Portable applications should avoid reliance
on bidirectional pipe semantics.</p>
