Perl security</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Perl is
designed to make it easy to program securely even when
running with extra privileges, like setuid or setgid
programs. Unlike most command line shells, which are based
on multiple substitution passes on each line of the script,
Perl uses a more conventional evaluation scheme with fewer
hidden snags. Additionally, because the language has more
builtin functionality, it can rely less upon external (and
possibly untrustworthy) programs to accomplish its
purposes.</p>

<h2>SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION
<a name="SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you believe
you have found a security vulnerability in Perl, please
email perl5&minus;security&minus;report@perl.org with
details. This points to a closed subscription, unarchived
mailing list. Please only use this address for security
issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently
distributed on <small>CPAN</small> .</p>

<h2>SECURITY MECHANISMS AND CONCERNS
<a name="SECURITY MECHANISMS AND CONCERNS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Taint
mode</b> <br>
Perl automatically enables a set of special security checks,
called <i>taint mode</i>, when it detects its program
running with differing real and effective user or group IDs.
The setuid bit in Unix permissions is mode 04000, the setgid
bit mode 02000; either or both may be set. You can also
enable taint mode explicitly by using the <b>&minus;T</b>
command line flag. This flag is <i>strongly</i> suggested
for server programs and any program run on behalf of someone
else, such as a <small>CGI</small> script. Once taint mode
is on, it&rsquo;s on for the remainder of your script.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">While in this
mode, Perl takes special precautions called <i>taint
checks</i> to prevent both obvious and subtle traps. Some of
these checks are reasonably simple, such as verifying that
path directories aren&rsquo;t writable by others; careful
programmers have always used checks like these. Other
checks, however, are best supported by the language itself,
and it is these checks especially that contribute to making
a set-id Perl program more secure than the corresponding C
program.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You may not use
data derived from outside your program to affect something
else outside your program--at least, not by accident. All
command line arguments, environment variables, locale
information (see perllocale), results of certain system
calls (<tt>&quot;readdir()&quot;</tt>,
<tt>&quot;readlink()&quot;</tt>, the variable of
<tt>&quot;shmread()&quot;</tt>, the messages returned by
<tt>&quot;msgrcv()&quot;</tt>, the password, gcos and shell
fields returned by the <tt>&quot;getpwxxx()&quot;</tt>
calls), and all file input are marked as
&quot;tainted&quot;. Tainted data may not be used directly
or indirectly in any command that invokes a sub-shell, nor
in any command that modifies files, directories, or
processes, <b>with the following exceptions</b>:</p>

want external data to affect your control flow. Unless you
carefully limit what these symbolic values are, people are
able to call functions <b>outside</b> your Perl code, such
as POSIX::system, in which case they are able to run
arbitrary external code.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For efficiency
reasons, Perl takes a conservative view of whether data is
tainted. If an expression contains tainted data, any
subexpression may be considered tainted, even if the value
of the subexpression is not itself affected by the tainted
data.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Because
taintedness is associated with each scalar value, some
elements of an array or hash can be tainted and others not.
The keys of a hash are <b>never</b> tainted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For
example:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    $arg = shift;               # $arg is tainted
    $hid = $arg, 'bar';         # $hid is also tainted
    $line = &lt;&gt;;                 # Tainted
    $line = &lt;STDIN&gt;;            # Also tainted
    open FOO, &quot;/home/me/bar&quot; or die $!;
    $line = &lt;FOO&gt;;              # Still tainted
    $path = $ENV{'PATH'};       # Tainted, but see below
    $data = 'abc';              # Not tainted
    system &quot;echo $arg&quot;;         # Insecure
    system &quot;/bin/echo&quot;, $arg;   # Considered insecure
                                # (Perl doesn't know about /bin/echo)
    system &quot;echo $hid&quot;;         # Insecure
    system &quot;echo $data&quot;;        # Insecure until PATH set
    $path = $ENV{'PATH'};       # $path now tainted
    $ENV{'PATH'} = '/bin:/usr/bin';
    delete @ENV{'IFS', 'CDPATH', 'ENV', 'BASH_ENV'};
    $path = $ENV{'PATH'};       # $path now NOT tainted
    system &quot;echo $data&quot;;        # Is secure now!
    open(FOO, &quot;&lt; $arg&quot;);        # OK &minus; read&minus;only file
    open(FOO, &quot;&gt; $arg&quot;);        # Not OK &minus; trying to write
    open(FOO,&quot;echo $arg|&quot;);     # Not OK
    open(FOO,&quot;&minus;|&quot;)
        or exec 'echo', $arg;   # Also not OK
    $shout = `echo $arg`;       # Insecure, $shout now tainted
    unlink $data, $arg;         # Insecure
    umask $arg;                 # Insecure
    exec &quot;echo $arg&quot;;           # Insecure
    exec &quot;echo&quot;, $arg;          # Insecure
    exec &quot;sh&quot;, '&minus;c', $arg;      # Very insecure!
    @files = &lt;*.c&gt;;             # insecure (uses readdir() or similar)
    @files = glob('*.c');       # insecure (uses readdir() or similar)
    # In Perl releases older than 5.6.0 the &lt;*.c&gt; and glob('*.c') would
    # have used an external program to do the filename expansion; but in
    # either case the result is tainted since the list of filenames comes
    # from outside of the program.
    $bad = ($arg, 23);          # $bad will be tainted
    $arg, `true`;               # Insecure (although it isn't really)</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you try to
do something insecure, you will get a fatal error saying
something like &quot;Insecure dependency&quot; or
&quot;Insecure <tt>$ENV</tt>{ <small>PATH</small>
}&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The exception
to the principle of &quot;one tainted value taints the whole
expression&quot; is with the ternary conditional operator
<tt>&quot;?:&quot;</tt>. Since code with a ternary
conditional</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    $result = $tainted_value ? &quot;Untainted&quot; : &quot;Also untainted&quot;;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">is
effectively</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    if ( $tainted_value ) {
        $result = &quot;Untainted&quot;;
    } else {
        $result = &quot;Also untainted&quot;;
    }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">it
doesn&rsquo;t make sense for <tt>$result</tt> to be
tainted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Laundering
and Detecting Tainted Data</b> <br>
To test whether a variable contains tainted data, and whose
use would thus trigger an &quot;Insecure dependency&quot;
message, you can use the <tt>&quot;tainted()&quot;</tt>
function of the Scalar::Util module, available in your
nearby <small>CPAN</small> mirror, and included in Perl
starting from the release 5.8.0. Or you may be able to use
the following <tt>&quot;is_tainted()&quot;</tt>
function.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    sub is_tainted {
        local $@;   # Don't pollute caller's value.
        return ! eval { eval(&quot;#&quot; . substr(join(&quot;&quot;, @_), 0, 0)); 1 };
    }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This function
makes use of the fact that the presence of tainted data
anywhere within an expression renders the entire expression
tainted. It would be inefficient for every operator to test
every argument for taintedness. Instead, the slightly more
efficient and conservative approach is used that if any
tainted value has been accessed within the same expression,
the whole expression is considered tainted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">But testing for
taintedness gets you only so far. Sometimes you have just to
clear your data&rsquo;s taintedness. Values may be untainted
by using them as keys in a hash; otherwise the only way to
bypass the tainting mechanism is by referencing subpatterns
from a regular expression match. Perl presumes that if you
reference a substring using <tt>$1</tt>, <tt>$2</tt>, etc.,
that you knew what you were doing when you wrote the
pattern. That means using a bit of thought--don&rsquo;t just
blindly untaint anything, or you defeat the entire
mechanism. It&rsquo;s better to verify that the variable has
only good characters (for certain values of
&quot;good&quot;) rather than checking whether it has any
bad characters. That&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s far too easy
to miss bad characters that you never thought of.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Here&rsquo;s a
test to make sure that the data contains nothing but
&quot;word&quot; characters (alphabetics, numerics, and
underscores), a hyphen, an at sign, or a dot.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    if ($data =~ /^([&minus;\@\w.]+)$/) {
        $data = $1;                     # $data now untainted
    } else {
        die &quot;Bad data in '$data'&quot;;      # log this somewhere
    }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This is fairly
secure because <tt>&quot;/\w+/&quot;</tt> doesn&rsquo;t
normally match shell metacharacters, nor are dot, dash, or
at going to mean something special to the shell. Use of
<tt>&quot;/.+/&quot;</tt> would have been insecure in theory
because it lets everything through, but Perl doesn&rsquo;t
check for that. The lesson is that when untainting, you must
be exceedingly careful with your patterns. Laundering data
using regular expression is the <i>only</i> mechanism for
untainting dirty data, unless you use the strategy detailed
below to fork a child of lesser privilege.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The example
does not untaint <tt>$data</tt> if <tt>&quot;use
locale&quot;</tt> is in effect, because the characters
matched by <tt>&quot;\w&quot;</tt> are determined by the
locale. Perl considers that locale definitions are
untrustworthy because they contain data from outside the
program. If you are writing a locale-aware program, and want
to launder data with a regular expression containing
<tt>&quot;\w&quot;</tt>, put <tt>&quot;no locale&quot;</tt>
ahead of the expression in the same block. See &quot;
<small>SECURITY</small> &quot; in perllocale for further
discussion and examples.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Switches On
the &quot;#!&quot; Line</b> <br>
When you make a script executable, in order to make it
usable as a command, the system will pass switches to perl
from the script&rsquo;s #! line. Perl checks that any
command line switches given to a setuid (or setgid) script
actually match the ones set on the #! line. Some Unix and
Unix-like environments impose a one-switch limit on the #!
line, so you may need to use something like
<tt>&quot;&minus;wU&quot;</tt> instead of <tt>&quot;&minus;w
&minus;U&quot;</tt> under such systems. (This issue should
arise only in Unix or Unix-like environments that support #!
and setuid or setgid scripts.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Taint mode
and @INC</b> <br>
When the taint mode (<tt>&quot;&minus;T&quot;</tt>) is in
effect, the &quot;.&quot; directory is removed from
<tt>@INC</tt>, and the environment variables
<tt>&quot;PERL5LIB&quot;</tt> and
<tt>&quot;PERLLIB&quot;</tt> are ignored by Perl. You can
still adjust <tt>@INC</tt> from outside the program by using
the <tt>&quot;&minus;I&quot;</tt> command line option as
explained in perlrun. The two environment variables are
ignored because they are obscured, and a user running a
program could be unaware that they are set, whereas the
<tt>&quot;&minus;I&quot;</tt> option is clearly visible and
therefore permitted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Another way to
modify <tt>@INC</tt> without modifying the program, is to
use the <tt>&quot;lib&quot;</tt> pragma, e.g.:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  perl &minus;Mlib=/foo program</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The benefit of
using <tt>&quot;&minus;Mlib=/foo&quot;</tt> over
<tt>&quot;&minus;I/foo&quot;</tt>, is that the former will
automagically remove any duplicated directories, while the
later will not.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that if a
tainted string is added to <tt>@INC</tt>, the following
problem will be reported:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  Insecure dependency in require while running with &minus;T switch</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Cleaning Up
Your Path</b> <br>
For &quot;Insecure <tt>$ENV{PATH}</tt>&quot; messages, you
need to set <tt>$ENV{'PATH'}</tt> to a known value, and each
directory in the path must be absolute and non-writable by
others than its owner and group. You may be surprised to get
this message even if the pathname to your executable is
fully qualified. This is <i>not</i> generated because you
didn&rsquo;t supply a full path to the program; instead,
it&rsquo;s generated because you never set your
<small>PATH</small> environment variable, or you
didn&rsquo;t set it to something that was safe. Because Perl
can&rsquo;t guarantee that the executable in question
isn&rsquo;t itself going to turn around and execute some
other program that is dependent on your <small>PATH</small>
, it makes sure you set the <small>PATH</small> .</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<small>PATH</small> isn&rsquo;t the only environment
variable which can cause problems. Because some shells may
use the variables <small>IFS</small> , <small>CDPATH</small>
, <small>ENV</small> , and <small>BASH_ENV</small> , Perl
checks that those are either empty or untainted when
starting subprocesses. You may wish to add something like
this to your setid and taint-checking scripts.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    delete @ENV{qw(IFS CDPATH ENV BASH_ENV)};   # Make %ENV safer</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It&rsquo;s also
possible to get into trouble with other operations that
don&rsquo;t care whether they use tainted values. Make
judicious use of the file tests in dealing with any
user-supplied filenames. When possible, do opens and such
<b>after</b> properly dropping any special user (or group!)
privileges. Perl doesn&rsquo;t prevent you from opening
tainted filenames for reading, so be careful what you print
out. The tainting mechanism is intended to prevent stupid
mistakes, not to remove the need for thought.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Perl does not
call the shell to expand wild cards when you pass
<tt>&quot;system&quot;</tt> and <tt>&quot;exec&quot;</tt>
explicit parameter lists instead of strings with possible
shell wildcards in them. Unfortunately, the
<tt>&quot;open&quot;</tt>, <tt>&quot;glob&quot;</tt>, and
backtick functions provide no such alternate calling
convention, so more subterfuge will be required.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Perl provides a
reasonably safe way to open a file or pipe from a setuid or
setgid program: just create a child process with reduced
privilege who does the dirty work for you. First, fork a
child using the special <tt>&quot;open&quot;</tt> syntax
that connects the parent and child by a pipe. Now the child
resets its <small>ID</small> set and any other per-process
attributes, like environment variables, umasks, current
working directories, back to the originals or known safe
values. Then the child process, which no longer has any
special permissions, does the <tt>&quot;open&quot;</tt> or
other system call. Finally, the child passes the data it
managed to access back to the parent. Because the file or
pipe was opened in the child while running under less
privilege than the parent, it&rsquo;s not apt to be tricked
into doing something it shouldn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Here&rsquo;s a
way to do backticks reasonably safely. Notice how the
<tt>&quot;exec&quot;</tt> is not called with a string that
the shell could expand. This is by far the best way to call
something that might be subjected to shell escapes: just
never call the shell at all.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">        use English '&minus;no_match_vars';
        die &quot;Can't fork: $!&quot; unless defined($pid = open(KID, &quot;&minus;|&quot;));
        if ($pid) {           # parent
            while (&lt;KID&gt;) {
                # do something
            }
            close KID;
        } else {
            my @temp     = ($EUID, $EGID);
            my $orig_uid = $UID;
            my $orig_gid = $GID;
            $EUID = $UID;
            $EGID = $GID;
            # Drop privileges
            $UID  = $orig_uid;
            $GID  = $orig_gid;
            # Make sure privs are really gone
            ($EUID, $EGID) = @temp;
            die &quot;Can't drop privileges&quot;
                unless $UID == $EUID  &amp;&amp; $GID eq $EGID;
            $ENV{PATH} = &quot;/bin:/usr/bin&quot;; # Minimal PATH.
            # Consider sanitizing the environment even more.
            exec 'myprog', 'arg1', 'arg2'
                or die &quot;can't exec myprog: $!&quot;;
        }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A similar
strategy would work for wildcard expansion via
<tt>&quot;glob&quot;</tt>, although you can use
<tt>&quot;readdir&quot;</tt> instead.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Taint checking
is most useful when although you trust yourself not to have
written a program to give away the farm, you don&rsquo;t
necessarily trust those who end up using it not to try to
trick it into doing something bad. This is the kind of
security checking that&rsquo;s useful for set-id programs
and programs launched on someone else&rsquo;s behalf, like
<small>CGI</small> programs.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This is quite
different, however, from not even trusting the writer of the
code not to try to do something evil. That&rsquo;s the kind
of trust needed when someone hands you a program
you&rsquo;ve never seen before and says, &quot;Here, run
this.&quot; For that kind of safety, you might want to check
out the Safe module, included standard in the Perl
distribution. This module allows the programmer to set up
special compartments in which all system operations are
trapped and namespace access is carefully controlled. Safe
should not be considered bullet-proof, though: it will not
prevent the foreign code to set up infinite loops, allocate
gigabytes of memory, or even abusing perl bugs to make the
host interpreter crash or behave in unpredictable ways. In
any case it&rsquo;s better avoided completely if
you&rsquo;re really concerned about security.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Security
Bugs</b> <br>
Beyond the obvious problems that stem from giving special
privileges to systems as flexible as scripts, on many
versions of Unix, set-id scripts are inherently insecure
right from the start. The problem is a race condition in the
kernel. Between the time the kernel opens the file to see
which interpreter to run and when the (now-set-id)
interpreter turns around and reopens the file to interpret
it, the file in question may have changed, especially if you
have symbolic links on your system.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Fortunately,
sometimes this kernel &quot;feature&quot; can be disabled.
Unfortunately, there are two ways to disable it. The system
can simply outlaw scripts with any set-id bit set, which
doesn&rsquo;t help much. Alternately, it can simply ignore
the set-id bits on scripts.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">However, if the
kernel set-id script feature isn&rsquo;t disabled, Perl will
complain loudly that your set-id script is insecure.
You&rsquo;ll need to either disable the kernel set-id script
feature, or put a C wrapper around the script. A C wrapper
is just a compiled program that does nothing except call
your Perl program. Compiled programs are not subject to the
kernel bug that plagues set-id scripts. Here&rsquo;s a
simple wrapper, written in C:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    #define REAL_PATH &quot;/path/to/script&quot;
    main(ac, av)
        char **av;
    {
        execv(REAL_PATH, av);
    }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Compile this
wrapper into a binary executable and then make <i>it</i>
rather than your script setuid or setgid.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In recent
years, vendors have begun to supply systems free of this
inherent security bug. On such systems, when the kernel
passes the name of the set-id script to open to the
interpreter, rather than using a pathname subject to
meddling, it instead passes <i>/dev/fd/3</i>. This is a
special file already opened on the script, so that there can
be no race condition for evil scripts to exploit. On these
systems, Perl should be compiled with
<tt>&quot;&minus;DSETUID_SCRIPTS_ARE_SECURE_NOW&quot;</tt>.
The <i>Configure</i> program that builds Perl tries to
figure this out for itself, so you should never have to
specify this yourself. Most modern releases of SysVr4 and
<small>BSD</small> 4.4 use this approach to avoid the kernel
race condition.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Protecting
Your Programs</b> <br>
There are a number of ways to hide the source to your Perl
programs, with varying levels of &quot;security&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">First of all,
however, you <i>can&rsquo;t</i> take away read permission,
because the source code has to be readable in order to be
compiled and interpreted. (That doesn&rsquo;t mean that a
<small>CGI</small> script&rsquo;s source is readable by
people on the web, though.) So you have to leave the
permissions at the socially friendly 0755 level. This lets
people on your local system only see your source.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Some people
mistakenly regard this as a security problem. If your
program does insecure things, and relies on people not
knowing how to exploit those insecurities, it is not secure.
It is often possible for someone to determine the insecure
things and exploit them without viewing the source. Security
through obscurity, the name for hiding your bugs instead of
fixing them, is little security indeed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can try
using encryption via source filters (Filter::* from
<small>CPAN</small> , or Filter::Util::Call and
Filter::Simple since Perl 5.8). But crackers might be able
to decrypt it. You can try using the byte code compiler and
interpreter described below, but crackers might be able to
de-compile it. You can try using the native-code compiler
described below, but crackers might be able to disassemble
it. These pose varying degrees of difficulty to people
wanting to get at your code, but none can definitively
conceal it (this is true of every language, not just
Perl).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you&rsquo;re
concerned about people profiting from your code, then the
bottom line is that nothing but a restrictive license will
give you legal security. License your software and pepper it
with threatening statements like &quot;This is unpublished
proprietary software of <small>XYZ</small> Corp. Your access
to it does not give you permission to use it blah blah
blah.&quot; You should see a lawyer to be sure your
license&rsquo;s wording will stand up in court.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Unicode</b>
<br>
Unicode is a new and complex technology and one may easily
overlook certain security pitfalls. See perluniintro for an
overview and perlunicode for details, and &quot;Security
Implications of Unicode&quot; in perlunicode for security
implications in particular.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Algorithmic
Complexity Attacks</b> <br>
Certain internal algorithms used in the implementation of
Perl can be attacked by choosing the input carefully to
consume large amounts of either time or space or both. This
can lead into the so-called <i>Denial of Service</i> (DoS)
attacks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Hash Function &minus; the
algorithm used to &quot;order&quot; hash elements has been
changed several times during the development of Perl, mainly
to be reasonably fast. In Perl 5.8.1 also the security
aspect was taken into account.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">In Perls before
5.8.1 one could rather easily generate data that as hash
keys would cause Perl to consume large amounts of time
because internal structure of hashes would badly degenerate.
In Perl 5.8.1 the hash function is randomly perturbed by a
pseudorandom seed which makes generating such naughty hash
keys harder. See &quot; <small>PERL_HASH_SEED</small> &quot;
in perlrun for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">In Perl 5.8.1
the random perturbation was done by default, but as of 5.8.2
it is only used on individual hashes if the internals detect
the insertion of pathological data. If one wants for some
reason emulate the old behaviour (and expose oneself to DoS
attacks) one can set the environment variable
<small>PERL_HASH_SEED</small> to zero to disable the
protection (or any other integer to force a known
perturbation, rather than random). One possible reason for
wanting to emulate the old behaviour is that in the new
behaviour consecutive runs of Perl will order hash keys
differently, which may confuse some applications (like
Data::Dumper: the outputs of two different runs are no
longer identical).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Perl has
never guaranteed any ordering of the hash keys</b>, and the
ordering has already changed several times during the
lifetime of Perl 5. Also, the ordering of hash keys has
always been, and continues to be, affected by the insertion
order.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Also note that
while the order of the hash elements might be randomised,
this &quot;pseudoordering&quot; should <b>not</b> be used
for applications like shuffling a list randomly (use
<i>List::Util::shuffle()</i> for that, see List::Util, a
standard core module since Perl 5.8.0; or the
<small>CPAN</small> module Algorithm::Numerical::Shuffle),
or for generating permutations (use e.g. the
<small>CPAN</small> modules Algorithm::Permute or
Algorithm::FastPermute), or for any cryptographic
applications.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Regular expressions &minus;
Perl&rsquo;s regular expression engine is so called
<small>NFA</small> (Non-deterministic Finite Automaton),
which among other things means that it can rather easily
consume large amounts of both time and space if the regular
expression may match in several ways. Careful crafting of
the regular expressions can help but quite often there
really isn&rsquo;t much one can do (the book &quot;Mastering
Regular Expressions&quot; is required reading, see
perlfaq2). Running out of space manifests itself by Perl
running out of memory.</p></td></tr>

<p>Sorting &minus; the quicksort algorithm used in Perls
before 5.8.0 to implement the <i>sort()</i> function is very
easy to trick into misbehaving so that it consumes a lot of
time. Starting from Perl 5.8.0 a different sorting
algorithm, mergesort, is used by default. Mergesort cannot
misbehave on any input.</p></td></tr>
