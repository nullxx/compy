&minus; Regular Expressions</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This section is
surprisingly small because the rest of the
<small>FAQ</small> is littered with answers involving
regular expressions. For example, decoding a
<small>URL</small> and checking whether something is a
number can be handled with regular expressions, but those
answers are found elsewhere in this document (in perlfaq9:
&quot;How do I decode or create those %&minus;encodings on
the web&quot; and perlfaq4: &quot;How do I determine whether
a scalar is a number/whole/integer/float&quot;, to be
precise).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>How can I
hope to use regular expressions without creating illegible
and unmaintainable code?</b> <br>
Three techniques can make regular expressions maintainable
and understandable. <br>
Comments Outside the Regex</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Describe what you&rsquo;re
doing and how you&rsquo;re doing it, using normal Perl
comments.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    # turn the line into the first word, a colon, and the
    # number of characters on the rest of the line
    s/^(\w+)(.*)/ lc($1) . &quot;:&quot; . length($2) /meg;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%;">Comments Inside the Regex</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The <tt>&quot;/x&quot;</tt>
modifier causes whitespace to be ignored in a regex pattern
(except in a character class and a few other places), and
also allows you to use normal comments there, too. As you
can imagine, whitespace and comments help a lot.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><tt>&quot;/x&quot;</tt>
lets you turn this:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    s{&lt;(?:[^&gt;'&quot;]*|&quot;.*?&quot;|'.*?')+&gt;}{}gs;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">into this:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    s{ &lt;                    # opening angle bracket
        (?:                 # Non&minus;backreffing grouping paren
            [^&gt;'&quot;] *        # 0 or more things that are neither &gt; nor ' nor &quot;
                |           #    or else
            &quot;.*?&quot;           # a section between double quotes (stingy match)
                |           #    or else
            '.*?'           # a section between single quotes (stingy match)
        ) +                 #   all occurring one or more times
        &gt;                   # closing angle bracket
    }{}gsx;                 # replace with nothing, i.e. delete</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">It&rsquo;s
still not quite so clear as prose, but it is very useful for
describing the meaning of each part of the pattern.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Different Delimiters</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">While we normally think of
patterns as being delimited with <tt>&quot;/&quot;</tt>
characters, they can be delimited by almost any character.
perlre describes this. For example, the
<tt>&quot;s///&quot;</tt> above uses braces as delimiters.
Selecting another delimiter can avoid quoting the delimiter
within the pattern:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    s/\/usr\/local/\/usr\/share/g;    # bad delimiter choice
    s#/usr/local#/usr/share#g;        # better</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Using logically
paired delimiters can be even more readable:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    s{/usr/local/}{/usr/share}g;      # better still</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>I&rsquo;m
having trouble matching over more than one line.
What&rsquo;s wrong?</b> <br>
Either you don&rsquo;t have more than one line in the string
you&rsquo;re looking at (probably), or else you aren&rsquo;t
using the correct modifier(s) on your pattern
(possibly).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There are many
ways to get multiline data into a string. If you want it to
happen automatically while reading input, you&rsquo;ll want
to set $/ (probably to &rsquo;&rsquo; for paragraphs or
<tt>&quot;undef&quot;</tt> for the whole file) to allow you
to read more than one line at a time.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Read perlre to
help you decide which of <tt>&quot;/s&quot;</tt> and
<tt>&quot;/m&quot;</tt> (or both) you might want to use:
<tt>&quot;/s&quot;</tt> allows dot to include newline, and
<tt>&quot;/m&quot;</tt> allows caret and dollar to match
next to a newline, not just at the end of the string. You do
need to make sure that you&rsquo;ve actually got a multiline
string in there.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For example,
this program detects duplicate words, even when they span
line breaks (but not paragraph ones). For this example, we
don&rsquo;t need <tt>&quot;/s&quot;</tt> because we
aren&rsquo;t using dot in a regular expression that we want
to cross line boundaries. Neither do we need
<tt>&quot;/m&quot;</tt> because we don&rsquo;t want caret or
dollar to match at any point inside the record next to
newlines. But it&rsquo;s imperative that $/ be set to
something other than the default, or else we won&rsquo;t
actually ever have a multiline record read in.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    $/ = '';          # read in whole paragraph, not just one line
    while ( &lt;&gt; ) {
        while ( /\b([\w'&minus;]+)(\s+\g1)+\b/gi ) {     # word starts alpha
            print &quot;Duplicate $1 at paragraph $.\n&quot;;
        }
    }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Here&rsquo;s
some code that finds sentences that begin with &quot;From
&quot; (which would be mangled by many mailers):</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    $/ = '';          # read in whole paragraph, not just one line
    while ( &lt;&gt; ) {
        while ( /^From /gm ) { # /m makes ^ match next to \n
        print &quot;leading from in paragraph $.\n&quot;;
        }
    }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Here&rsquo;s
code that finds everything between <small>START</small> and
<small>END</small> in a paragraph:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    undef $/;          # read in whole file, not just one line or paragraph
    while ( &lt;&gt; ) {
        while ( /START(.*?)END/sgm ) { # /s makes . cross line boundaries
            print &quot;$1\n&quot;;
        }
    }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>How can I
pull out lines between two patterns that are themselves on
different lines?</b> <br>
You can use Perl&rsquo;s somewhat exotic
<tt>&quot;..&quot;</tt> operator (documented in perlop):</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    perl &minus;ne 'print if /START/ .. /END/' file1 file2 ...</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you wanted
text and not lines, you would use</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    perl &minus;0777 &minus;ne 'print &quot;$1\n&quot; while /START(.*?)END/gs' file1 file2 ...</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">But if you want
nested occurrences of <tt>&quot;START&quot;</tt> through
<tt>&quot;END&quot;</tt>, you&rsquo;ll run up against the
problem described in the question in this section on
matching balanced text.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Here&rsquo;s
another example of using <tt>&quot;..&quot;</tt>:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    while (&lt;&gt;) {
        my $in_header =   1  .. /^$/;
        my $in_body   = /^$/ .. eof;
    # now choose between them
    } continue {
        $. = 0 if eof;    # fix $.
    }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>How do I
match <small>XML</small> , <small>HTML</small> , or other
nasty, ugly things with a regex?</b> <br>
Do not use regexes. Use a module and forget about the
regular expressions. The XML::LibXML, HTML::TokeParser and
HTML::TreeBuilder modules are good starts, although each
namespace has other parsing modules specialized for certain
tasks and different ways of doing it. Start at
<small>CPAN</small> Search ( &lt;http://metacpan.org/&gt; )
and wonder at all the work people have done for you already!
:)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>I put a
regular expression into $/ but it didn&rsquo;t work.
What&rsquo;s wrong?</b> <br>
$/ has to be a string. You can use these examples if you
really need to do this.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you have
File::Stream, this is easy.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    use File::Stream;
    my $stream = File::Stream&minus;&gt;new(
        $filehandle,
        separator =&gt; qr/\s*,\s*/,
        );
    print &quot;$_\n&quot; while &lt;$stream&gt;;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you
don&rsquo;t have File::Stream, you have to do a little more
work.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can use the
four-argument form of sysread to continually add to a
buffer. After you add to the buffer, you check if you have a
complete line (using your regular expression).</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    local $_ = &quot;&quot;;
    while( sysread FH, $_, 8192, length ) {
        while( s/^((?s).*?)your_pattern// ) {
            my $record = $1;
            # do stuff here.
        }
    }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can do the
same thing with foreach and a match using the c flag and the
\G anchor, if you do not mind your entire file being in
memory at the end.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    local $_ = &quot;&quot;;
    while( sysread FH, $_, 8192, length ) {
        foreach my $record ( m/\G((?s).*?)your_pattern/gc ) {
            # do stuff here.
        }
        substr( $_, 0, pos ) = &quot;&quot; if pos;
    }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>How do I
substitute case-insensitively on the <small>LHS</small>
while preserving case on the <small>RHS</small> ?</b> <br>
Here&rsquo;s a lovely Perlish solution by Larry Rosler. It
exploits properties of bitwise xor on <small>ASCII</small>
strings.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    $_= &quot;this is a TEsT case&quot;;
    $old = 'test';
    $new = 'success';
    s{(\Q$old\E)}
    { uc $new | (uc $1 ^ $1) .
        (uc(substr $1, &minus;1) ^ substr $1, &minus;1) x
        (length($new) &minus; length $1)
    }egi;
    print;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">And here it is
as a subroutine, modeled after the above:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    sub preserve_case($$) {
        my ($old, $new) = @_;
        my $mask = uc $old ^ $old;
        uc $new | $mask .
            substr($mask, &minus;1) x (length($new) &minus; length($old))
    }
    $string = &quot;this is a TEsT case&quot;;
    $string =~ s/(test)/preserve_case($1, &quot;success&quot;)/egi;
    print &quot;$string\n&quot;;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This
prints:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    this is a SUcCESS case</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As an
alternative, to keep the case of the replacement word if it
is longer than the original, you can use this code, by Jeff
Pinyan:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    sub preserve_case {
        my ($from, $to) = @_;
        my ($lf, $lt) = map length, @_;
        if ($lt &lt; $lf) { $from = substr $from, 0, $lt }
        else { $from .= substr $to, $lf }
        return uc $to | ($from ^ uc $from);
    }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This changes
the sentence to &quot;this is a SUcCess case.&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Just to show
that C programmers can write C in any programming language,
if you prefer a more C&minus;like solution, the following
script makes the substitution have the same case, letter by
letter, as the original. (It also happens to run about 240%
slower than the Perlish solution runs.) If the substitution
has more characters than the string being substituted, the
case of the last character is used for the rest of the
substitution.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    # Original by Nathan Torkington, massaged by Jeffrey Friedl
    #
    sub preserve_case($$)
    {
        my ($old, $new) = @_;
        my $state = 0; # 0 = no change; 1 = lc; 2 = uc
        my ($i, $oldlen, $newlen, $c) = (0, length($old), length($new));
        my $len = $oldlen &lt; $newlen ? $oldlen : $newlen;

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>How can I
make &quot;\w&quot; match national character sets?</b> <br>
Put <tt>&quot;use locale;&quot;</tt> in your script. The \w
character class is taken from the current locale.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">See perllocale
for details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>How can I
match a locale-smart version of
&quot;/[a&minus;zA&minus;Z]/&quot;?</b> <br>
You can use the <small>POSIX</small> character class syntax
<tt>&quot;/[[:alpha:]]/&quot;</tt> documented in perlre.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">No matter which
locale you are in, the alphabetic characters are the
characters in \w without the digits and the underscore. As a
regex, that looks like <tt>&quot;/[^\W\d_]/&quot;</tt>. Its
complement, the non-alphabetics, is then everything in \W
along with the digits and the underscore, or
<tt>&quot;/[\W\d_]/&quot;</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>How can I
quote a variable to use in a regex?</b> <br>
The Perl parser will expand <tt>$variable</tt> and
<tt>@variable</tt> references in regular expressions unless
the delimiter is a single quote. Remember, too, that the
right-hand side of a <tt>&quot;s///&quot;</tt> substitution
is considered a double-quoted string (see perlop for more
details). Remember also that any regex special characters
will be acted on unless you precede the substitution with
\Q. Here&rsquo;s an example:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    $string = &quot;Placido P. Octopus&quot;;
    $regex  = &quot;P.&quot;;
    $string =~ s/$regex/Polyp/;
    # $string is now &quot;Polypacido P. Octopus&quot;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Because
<tt>&quot;.&quot;</tt> is special in regular expressions,
and can match any single character, the regex
<tt>&quot;P.&quot;</tt> here has matched the &lt;Pl&gt; in
the original string.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To escape the
special meaning of <tt>&quot;.&quot;</tt>, we use
<tt>&quot;\Q&quot;</tt>:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    $string = &quot;Placido P. Octopus&quot;;
    $regex  = &quot;P.&quot;;
    $string =~ s/\Q$regex/Polyp/;
    # $string is now &quot;Placido Polyp Octopus&quot;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The use of
<tt>&quot;\Q&quot;</tt> causes the &lt;.&gt; in the regex to
be treated as a regular character, so that
<tt>&quot;P.&quot;</tt> matches a <tt>&quot;P&quot;</tt>
followed by a dot.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>What is
&quot;/o&quot; really for?</b> <br>
(contributed by brian d foy)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<tt>&quot;/o&quot;</tt> option for regular expressions
(documented in perlop and perlreref) tells Perl to compile
the regular expression only once. This is only useful when
the pattern contains a variable. Perls 5.6 and later handle
this automatically if the pattern does not change.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Since the match
operator <tt>&quot;m//&quot;</tt>, the substitution operator
<tt>&quot;s///&quot;</tt>, and the regular expression
quoting operator <tt>&quot;qr//&quot;</tt> are
double-quotish constructs, you can interpolate variables
into the pattern. See the answer to &quot;How can I quote a
variable to use in a regex?&quot; for more details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This example
takes a regular expression from the argument list and prints
the lines of input that match it:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    my $pattern = shift @ARGV;
    while( &lt;&gt; ) {
        print if m/$pattern/;
    }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Versions of
Perl prior to 5.6 would recompile the regular expression for
each iteration, even if <tt>$pattern</tt> had not changed.
The <tt>&quot;/o&quot;</tt> would prevent this by telling
Perl to compile the pattern the first time, then reuse that
for subsequent iterations:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    my $pattern = shift @ARGV;
    while( &lt;&gt; ) {
        print if m/$pattern/o; # useful for Perl &lt; 5.6
    }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In versions 5.6
and later, Perl won&rsquo;t recompile the regular expression
if the variable hasn&rsquo;t changed, so you probably
don&rsquo;t need the <tt>&quot;/o&quot;</tt> option. It
doesn&rsquo;t hurt, but it doesn&rsquo;t help either. If you
want any version of Perl to compile the regular expression
only once even if the variable changes (thus, only using its
initial value), you still need the
<tt>&quot;/o&quot;</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can watch
Perl&rsquo;s regular expression engine at work to verify for
yourself if Perl is recompiling a regular expression. The
<tt>&quot;use re 'debug'&quot;</tt> pragma (comes with Perl
5.005 and later) shows the details. With Perls before 5.6,
you should see <tt>&quot;re&quot;</tt> reporting that its
compiling the regular expression on each iteration. With
Perl 5.6 or later, you should only see
<tt>&quot;re&quot;</tt> report that for the first
iteration.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    use re 'debug';
    my $regex = 'Perl';
    foreach ( qw(Perl Java Ruby Python) ) {
        print STDERR &quot;&minus;&quot; x 73, &quot;\n&quot;;
        print STDERR &quot;Trying $_...\n&quot;;
        print STDERR &quot;\t$_ is good!\n&quot; if m/$regex/;
    }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>How do I use
a regular expression to strip C&minus;style comments from a
file?</b> <br>
While this actually can be done, it&rsquo;s much harder than
you&rsquo;d think. For example, this one-liner</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    perl &minus;0777 &minus;pe 's{/\*.*?\*/}{}gs' foo.c</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">will work in
many but not all cases. You see, it&rsquo;s too
simple-minded for certain kinds of C programs, in
particular, those with what appear to be comments in quoted
strings. For that, you&rsquo;d need something like this,
created by Jeffrey Friedl and later modified by Fred
Curtis.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    $/ = undef;

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This could, of
course, be more legibly written with the

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Can I use
Perl regular expressions to match balanced text?</b> <br>
(contributed by brian d foy)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Your first try
should probably be the Text::Balanced module, which is in
the Perl standard library since Perl 5.8. It has a variety
of functions to deal with tricky text. The Regexp::Common
module can also help by providing canned patterns you can
use.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As of Perl
5.10, you can match balanced text with regular expressions
using recursive patterns. Before Perl 5.10, you had to
resort to various tricks such as using Perl code in
<tt>&quot;(??{})&quot;</tt> sequences.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Here&rsquo;s an
example using a recursive regular expression. The goal is to
capture all of the text within angle brackets, including the
text in nested angle brackets. This sample text has two
&quot;major&quot; groups: a group with one level of nesting
and a group with two levels of nesting. There are five total
groups in angle brackets:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    I have some &lt;brackets in &lt;nested brackets&gt; &gt; and
    &lt;another group &lt;nested once &lt;nested twice&gt; &gt; &gt;
    and that's it.</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The regular
expression to match the balanced text uses two new (to Perl
5.10) regular expression features. These are covered in
perlre and this example is a modified version of one in that
documentation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">First, adding
the new possessive <tt>&quot;+&quot;</tt> to any quantifier
finds the longest match and does not backtrack. That&rsquo;s
important since you want to handle any angle brackets
through the recursion, not backtracking. The group
<tt>&quot;[^&lt;&gt;]++&quot;</tt> finds one or more
non-angle brackets without backtracking.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Second, the new
<tt>&quot;(?PARNO)&quot;</tt> refers to the sub-pattern in
the particular capture group given by
<tt>&quot;PARNO&quot;</tt>. In the following regex, the
first capture group finds (and remembers) the balanced text,
and you need that same pattern within the first buffer to
get past the nested text. That&rsquo;s the recursive part.
The <tt>&quot;(?1)&quot;</tt> uses the pattern in the outer
capture group as an independent part of the regex.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Putting it all
together, you have:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    #!/usr/local/bin/perl5.10.0
    my $string =&lt;&lt;&quot;HERE&quot;;
    I have some &lt;brackets in &lt;nested brackets&gt; &gt; and
    &lt;another group &lt;nested once &lt;nested twice&gt; &gt; &gt;
    and that's it.
    HERE
    my @groups = $string =~ m/
            (                   # start of capture group 1
            &lt;                   # match an opening angle bracket
                (?:
                    [^&lt;&gt;]++     # one or more non angle brackets, non backtracking
                      |
                    (?1)        # found &lt; or &gt;, so recurse to capture group 1
                )*
            &gt;                   # match a closing angle bracket
            )                   # end of capture group 1
            /xg;
    $&quot; = &quot;\n\t&quot;;
    print &quot;Found:\n\t@groups\n&quot;;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The output
shows that Perl found the two major groups:</p>

        &lt;another group &lt;nested once &lt;nested twice&gt; &gt; &gt;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">With a little
extra work, you can get the all of the groups in angle
brackets even if they are in other angle brackets too. Each
time you get a balanced match, remove its outer delimiter
(that&rsquo;s the one you just matched so don&rsquo;t match
it again) and add it to a queue of strings to process. Keep
doing that until you get no matches:</p>

                    (?1)        # recurse to bracket 1

        unshift @queue, map { s/^&lt;//; s/&gt;$//; $_ } @groups;
    }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The output
shows all of the groups. The outermost matches show up first
and the nested matches so up later:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    Found:

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>What does it
mean that regexes are greedy? How can I get around it?</b>
<br>
Most people mean that greedy regexes match as much as they
can. Technically speaking, it&rsquo;s actually the
quantifiers (<tt>&quot;?&quot;</tt>, <tt>&quot;*&quot;</tt>,
<tt>&quot;+&quot;</tt>, <tt>&quot;{}&quot;</tt>) that are
greedy rather than the whole pattern; Perl prefers local
greed and immediate gratification to overall greed. To get
non-greedy versions of the same quantifiers, use
(<tt>&quot;??&quot;</tt>, <tt>&quot;*?&quot;</tt>,
<tt>&quot;+?&quot;</tt>, <tt>&quot;{}?&quot;</tt>).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">An example:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    my $s1 = my $s2 = &quot;I am very very cold&quot;;
    $s1 =~ s/ve.*y //;      # I am cold
    $s2 =~ s/ve.*?y //;     # I am very cold</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Notice how the
second substitution stopped matching as soon as it
encountered &quot;y &quot;. The <tt>&quot;*?&quot;</tt>
quantifier effectively tells the regular expression engine
to find a match as quickly as possible and pass control on
to whatever is next in line, as you would if you were
playing hot potato.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>How do I
process each word on each line?</b> <br>
Use the split function:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    while (&lt;&gt;) {
        foreach my $word ( split ) {
            # do something with $word here
        }
    }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that this
isn&rsquo;t really a word in the English sense; it&rsquo;s
just chunks of consecutive non-whitespace characters.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To work with

might consider</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    while (&lt;&gt;) {

            # do something with $word here

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>How can I
print out a word-frequency or line-frequency summary?</b>
<br>
To do this, you have to parse out each word in the input
stream. We&rsquo;ll pretend that by word you mean chunk of
alphabetics, hyphens, or apostrophes, rather than the
non-whitespace chunk idea of a word given in the previous
question:</p>

    while ( my ($word, $count) = each %seen ) {
        print &quot;$count $word\n&quot;;
    }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you wanted
to do the same thing for lines, you wouldn&rsquo;t need a

(contributed by brian d foy)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you have
Perl 5.10 or later, this is almost trivial. You just smart
match against an array of regular expression objects:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    my @patterns = ( qr/Fr.d/, qr/B.rn.y/, qr/W.lm./ );
    if( $string ~~ @patterns ) {
        ...
    };</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The smart match
stops when it finds a match, so it doesn&rsquo;t have to try
every expression.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Earlier than
Perl 5.10, you have a bit of work to do. You want to avoid
compiling a regular expression every time you want to match
it. In this example, perl must recompile the regular
expression for every iteration of the
<tt>&quot;foreach&quot;</tt> loop since it has no way to
know what <tt>$pattern</tt> will be:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    my @patterns = qw( foo bar baz );
    LINE: while( &lt;DATA&gt; ) {
        foreach $pattern ( @patterns ) {
            if( /\b$pattern\b/i ) {
                print;
                next LINE;
            }
        }
    }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<tt>&quot;qr//&quot;</tt> operator showed up in perl 5.005.
It compiles a regular expression, but doesn&rsquo;t apply
it. When you use the pre-compiled version of the regex, perl
does less work. In this example, I inserted a
<tt>&quot;map&quot;</tt> to turn each pattern into its
pre-compiled form. The rest of the script is the same, but
faster:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    my @patterns = map { qr/\b$_\b/i } qw( foo bar baz );
    LINE: while( &lt;&gt; ) {
        foreach $pattern ( @patterns ) {
            if( /$pattern/ ) {
                print;
                next LINE;
            }
        }
    }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In some cases,
you may be able to make several patterns into a single
regular expression. Beware of situations that require
backtracking though.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    my $regex = join '|', qw( foo bar baz );
    LINE: while( &lt;&gt; ) {
        print if /\b(?:$regex)\b/i;
    }</pre>

the regular expressions engine works and why some patterns

(contributed by brian d foy)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Ensure that you
know what \b really does: it&rsquo;s the boundary between a
word character, \w, and something that isn&rsquo;t a word
character. That thing that isn&rsquo;t a word character

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It&rsquo;s not
(not!) the boundary between whitespace and non-whitespace,
and it&rsquo;s not the stuff between words we use to create
sentences.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In regex speak,
a word boundary (\b) is a &quot;zero width assertion&quot;,
meaning that it doesn&rsquo;t represent a character in the
string, but a condition at a certain position.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For the regular
expression, /\bPerl\b/, there has to be a word boundary
before the &quot;P&quot; and after the &quot;l&quot;. As
long as something other than a word character precedes the

will match. These strings match /\bPerl\b/.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Why does
using $&amp;, $&lsquo;, or $&rsquo; slow my program
down?</b> <br>
(contributed by Anno Siegel)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Once Perl sees
that you need one of these variables anywhere in the
program, it provides them on each and every pattern match.
That means that on every pattern match the entire string
will be copied, part of it to $&lsquo;, part to $&amp;, and
part to $&rsquo;. Thus the penalty is most severe with long
strings and patterns that match often. Avoid $&amp;,
$&rsquo;, and $&lsquo; if you can, but if you can&rsquo;t,
once you&rsquo;ve used them at all, use them at will because
you&rsquo;ve already paid the price. Remember that some
algorithms really appreciate them. As of the 5.005 release,
the $&amp; variable is no longer &quot;expensive&quot; the
way the other two are.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Since Perl
5.6.1 the special variables @&minus; and @+ can functionally
replace $&lsquo;, $&amp; and $&rsquo;. These arrays contain
pointers to the beginning and end of each match (see perlvar
for the full story), so they give you essentially the same
information, but without the risk of excessive string
copying.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Perl 5.10 added
three specials, <tt>&quot;${^MATCH}&quot;</tt>,
<tt>&quot;${^PREMATCH}&quot;</tt>, and
<tt>&quot;${^POSTMATCH}&quot;</tt> to do the same job but
without the global performance penalty. Perl 5.10 only sets
these variables if you compile or execute the regular
expression with the <tt>&quot;/p&quot;</tt> modifier.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>What good is
&quot;\G&quot; in a regular expression?</b> <br>
You use the <tt>&quot;\G&quot;</tt> anchor to start the next
match on the same string where the last match left off. The
regular expression engine cannot skip over any characters to
find the next match with this anchor, so
<tt>&quot;\G&quot;</tt> is similar to the beginning of
string anchor, <tt>&quot;^&quot;</tt>. The
<tt>&quot;\G&quot;</tt> anchor is typically used with the
<tt>&quot;g&quot;</tt> flag. It uses the value of
<tt>&quot;pos()&quot;</tt> as the position to start the next
match. As the match operator makes successive matches, it
updates <tt>&quot;pos()&quot;</tt> with the position of the
next character past the last match (or the first character
of the next match, depending on how you like to look at it).
Each string has its own <tt>&quot;pos()&quot;</tt>
value.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Suppose you
want to match all of consecutive pairs of digits in a string
like &quot;1122a44&quot; and stop matching when you
encounter non-digits. You want to match <tt>11</tt> and
<tt>22</tt> but the letter &lt;a&gt; shows up between
<tt>22</tt> and <tt>44</tt> and you want to stop at
<tt>&quot;a&quot;</tt>. Simply matching pairs of digits
skips over the <tt>&quot;a&quot;</tt> and still matches
<tt>44</tt>.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    $_ = &quot;1122a44&quot;;
    my @pairs = m/(\d\d)/g;   # qw( 11 22 44 )</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you use the
<tt>&quot;\G&quot;</tt> anchor, you force the match after
<tt>22</tt> to start with the <tt>&quot;a&quot;</tt>. The
regular expression cannot match there since it does not find
a digit, so the next match fails and the match operator
returns the pairs it already found.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    $_ = &quot;1122a44&quot;;
    my @pairs = m/\G(\d\d)/g; # qw( 11 22 )</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can also
use the <tt>&quot;\G&quot;</tt> anchor in scalar context.
You still need the <tt>&quot;g&quot;</tt> flag.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    $_ = &quot;1122a44&quot;;
    while( m/\G(\d\d)/g ) {
        print &quot;Found $1\n&quot;;
    }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">After the match
fails at the letter <tt>&quot;a&quot;</tt>, perl resets
<tt>&quot;pos()&quot;</tt> and the next match on the same
string starts at the beginning.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    $_ = &quot;1122a44&quot;;
    while( m/\G(\d\d)/g ) {
        print &quot;Found $1\n&quot;;
    }
    print &quot;Found $1 after while&quot; if m/(\d\d)/g; # finds &quot;11&quot;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can disable
<tt>&quot;pos()&quot;</tt> resets on fail with the
<tt>&quot;c&quot;</tt> flag, documented in perlop and
perlreref. Subsequent matches start where the last
successful match ended (the value of
<tt>&quot;pos()&quot;</tt>) even if a match on the same
string has failed in the meantime. In this case, the match
after the <tt>&quot;while()&quot;</tt> loop starts at the
<tt>&quot;a&quot;</tt> (where the last match stopped), and
since it does not use any anchor it can skip over the
<tt>&quot;a&quot;</tt> to find <tt>44</tt>.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    $_ = &quot;1122a44&quot;;
    while( m/\G(\d\d)/gc ) {
        print &quot;Found $1\n&quot;;
    }
    print &quot;Found $1 after while&quot; if m/(\d\d)/g; # finds &quot;44&quot;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Typically you
use the <tt>&quot;\G&quot;</tt> anchor with the
<tt>&quot;c&quot;</tt> flag when you want to try a different
match if one fails, such as in a tokenizer. Jeffrey Friedl
offers this example which works in 5.004 or later.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    while (&lt;&gt;) {
        chomp;
        PARSER: {
            m/ \G( \d+\b    )/gcx   &amp;&amp; do { print &quot;number: $1\n&quot;;  redo; };
            m/ \G( \w+      )/gcx   &amp;&amp; do { print &quot;word:   $1\n&quot;;  redo; };
            m/ \G( \s+      )/gcx   &amp;&amp; do { print &quot;space:  $1\n&quot;;  redo; };
            m/ \G( [^\w\d]+ )/gcx   &amp;&amp; do { print &quot;other:  $1\n&quot;;  redo; };
        }
    }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For each line,
the <tt>&quot;PARSER&quot;</tt> loop first tries to match a
series of digits followed by a word boundary. This match has
to start at the place the last match left off (or the
beginning of the string on the first match). Since
<tt>&quot;m/ \G( \d+\b )/gcx&quot;</tt> uses the
<tt>&quot;c&quot;</tt> flag, if the string does not match
that regular expression, perl does not reset <i>pos()</i>
and the next match starts at the same position to try a
different pattern.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Are Perl
regexes DFAs or NFAs? Are they <small>POSIX</small>
compliant?</b> <br>
While it&rsquo;s true that Perl&rsquo;s regular expressions
resemble the DFAs (deterministic finite automata) of the
<i>egrep</i>(1) program, they are in fact implemented as
NFAs (non-deterministic finite automata) to allow
backtracking and backreferencing. And they aren&rsquo;t
POSIX-style either, because those guarantee worst-case
behavior for all cases. (It seems that some people prefer
guarantees of consistency, even when what&rsquo;s guaranteed
is slowness.) See the book &quot;Mastering Regular
Expressions&quot; (from O&rsquo;Reilly) by Jeffrey Friedl
for all the details you could ever hope to know on these
matters (a full citation appears in perlfaq2).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>What&rsquo;s
wrong with using grep in a void context?</b> <br>
The problem is that grep builds a return list, regardless of
the context. This means you&rsquo;re making Perl go to the
trouble of building a list that you then just throw away. If
the list is large, you waste both time and space. If your
intent is to iterate over the list, then use a for loop for
this purpose.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In perls older
than 5.8.1, map suffers from this problem as well. But since
5.8.1, this has been fixed, and map is context aware &minus;
in void context, no lists are constructed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>How can I
match strings with multibyte characters?</b> <br>
Starting from Perl 5.6 Perl has had some level of multibyte
character support. Perl 5.8 or later is recommended.
Supported multibyte character repertoires include Unicode,
and legacy encodings through the Encode module. See
perluniintro, perlunicode, and Encode.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you are
stuck with older Perls, you can do Unicode with the
Unicode::String module, and character conversions using the
Unicode::Map8 and Unicode::Map modules. If you are using
Japanese encodings, you might try using the jperl
5.005_03.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Finally, the
following set of approaches was offered by Jeffrey Friedl,
whose article in issue #5 of The Perl Journal talks about
this very matter.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Let&rsquo;s
suppose you have some weird Martian encoding where pairs of
<small>ASCII</small> uppercase letters encode single Martian
letters (i.e. the two bytes &quot; <small>CV</small> &quot;
make a single Martian letter, as do the two bytes &quot;
<small>SG</small> &quot;, &quot; <small>VS</small> &quot;,
&quot; <small>XX</small> &quot;, etc.). Other bytes
represent single characters, just like <small>ASCII</small>
.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">So, the string
of Martian &quot;I am <small>CVSGXX</small> !&quot; uses 12
bytes to encode the nine characters &rsquo;I&rsquo;, &rsquo;
&rsquo;, &rsquo;a&rsquo;, &rsquo;m&rsquo;, &rsquo; &rsquo;,
&rsquo; <small>CV</small> &rsquo;, &rsquo; <small>SG</small>
&rsquo;, &rsquo; <small>XX</small> &rsquo;,
&rsquo;!&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Now, say you
want to search for the single character
<tt>&quot;/GX/&quot;</tt>. Perl doesn&rsquo;t know about
Martian, so it&rsquo;ll find the two bytes &quot;
<small>GX</small> &quot; in the &quot;I am
<small>CVSGXX</small> !&quot; string, even though that
character isn&rsquo;t there: it just looks like it is
because &quot; <small>SG</small> &quot; is next to &quot;
<small>XX</small> &quot;, but there&rsquo;s no real &quot;
<small>GX</small> &quot;. This is a big problem.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Here are a few
ways, all painful, to deal with it:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    # Make sure adjacent &quot;martian&quot; bytes are no longer adjacent.
    $martian =~ s/([A&minus;Z][A&minus;Z])/ $1 /g;
    print &quot;found GX!\n&quot; if $martian =~ /GX/;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Or like
this:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    my @chars = $martian =~ m/([A&minus;Z][A&minus;Z]|[^A&minus;Z])/g;
    # above is conceptually similar to:     my @chars = $text =~ m/(.)/g;
    #
    foreach my $char (@chars) {
        print &quot;found GX!\n&quot;, last if $char eq 'GX';
    }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Or like
this:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    while ($martian =~ m/\G([A&minus;Z][A&minus;Z]|.)/gs) {  # \G probably unneeded
        if ($1 eq 'GX') {
            print &quot;found GX!\n&quot;;
            last;
        }
    }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Here&rsquo;s
another, slightly less painful, way to do it from Benjamin
Goldberg, who uses a zero-width negative look-behind
assertion.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    print &quot;found GX!\n&quot; if    $martian =~ m/
        (?&lt;![A&minus;Z])
        (?:[A&minus;Z][A&minus;Z])*?
        GX
        /x;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This succeeds
if the &quot;martian&quot; character <small>GX</small> is in
the string, and fails otherwise. If you don&rsquo;t like
using (?&lt;!), a zero-width negative look-behind assertion,
you can replace (?&lt;![A&minus;Z]) with
(?:^|[^A&minus;Z]).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It does have
the drawback of putting the wrong thing in $&minus;[0] and
$+[0], but this usually can be worked around.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>How do I
match a regular expression that&rsquo;s in a variable?</b>
<br>
(contributed by brian d foy)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">We don&rsquo;t
have to hard-code patterns into the match operator (or
anything else that works with regular expressions). We can
put the pattern in a variable for later use.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The match
operator is a double quote context, so you can interpolate
your variable just like a double quoted string. In this
case, you read the regular expression as user input and
store it in <tt>$regex</tt>. Once you have the pattern in
<tt>$regex</tt>, you use that variable in the match
operator.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    chomp( my $regex = &lt;STDIN&gt; );
    if( $string =~ m/$regex/ ) { ... }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Any regular
expression special characters in <tt>$regex</tt> are still
special, and the pattern still has to be valid or Perl will
complain. For instance, in this pattern there is an unpaired
parenthesis.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    my $regex = &quot;Unmatched ( paren&quot;;
    &quot;Two parens to bind them all&quot; =~ m/$regex/;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When Perl
compiles the regular expression, it treats the parenthesis
as the start of a memory match. When it doesn&rsquo;t find
the closing parenthesis, it complains:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    Unmatched ( in regex; marked by &lt;&minus;&minus; HERE in m/Unmatched ( &lt;&minus;&minus; HERE  paren/ at script line 3.</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can get
around this in several ways depending on our situation.
First, if you don&rsquo;t want any of the characters in the
string to be special, you can escape them with
<tt>&quot;quotemeta&quot;</tt> before you use the
string.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    chomp( my $regex = &lt;STDIN&gt; );
    $regex = quotemeta( $regex );
    if( $string =~ m/$regex/ ) { ... }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can also do
this directly in the match operator using the
<tt>&quot;\Q&quot;</tt> and <tt>&quot;\E&quot;</tt>
sequences. The <tt>&quot;\Q&quot;</tt> tells Perl where to
start escaping special characters, and the
<tt>&quot;\E&quot;</tt> tells it where to stop (see perlop
for more details).</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    chomp( my $regex = &lt;STDIN&gt; );
    if( $string =~ m/\Q$regex\E/ ) { ... }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Alternately,
you can use <tt>&quot;qr//&quot;</tt>, the regular
expression quote operator (see perlop for more details). It
quotes and perhaps compiles the pattern, and you can apply
regular expression flags to the pattern.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    chomp( my $input = &lt;STDIN&gt; );
    my $regex = qr/$input/is;
    $string =~ m/$regex/  # same as m/$input/is;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You might also
want to trap any errors by wrapping an
<tt>&quot;eval&quot;</tt> block around the whole thing.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    chomp( my $input = &lt;STDIN&gt; );
    eval {
        if( $string =~ m/\Q$input\E/ ) { ... }
    };
    warn $@ if $@;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Or...</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    my $regex = eval { qr/$input/is };
    if( defined $regex ) {
        $string =~ m/$regex/;
    }
    else {
        warn $@;
    }</pre>
