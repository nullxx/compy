<h2>INTRODUCTION
<a name="INTRODUCTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">All Tcl
commands and C procedures that take file names as arguments
expect the file names to be in one of three forms, depending
on the current platform. On each platform, Tcl supports file
names in the standard forms(s) for that platform. In
addition, on all platforms, Tcl supports a Unix-like syntax
intended to provide a convenient way of constructing simple
file names. However, scripts that are intended to be
portable should not assume a particular form for file names.
Instead, portable scripts must use the <b>file split</b> and
<b>file join</b> commands to manipulate file names (see the
<b>file</b> manual entry for more details).</p>

<h2>PATH TYPES
<a name="PATH TYPES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">File names are
grouped into three general types based on the starting point
for the path used to specify the file: absolute, relative,
and volume-relative. Absolute names are completely
qualified, giving a path to the file relative to a
particular volume and the root directory on that volume.
Relative names are unqualified, giving a path to the file
relative to the current working directory. Volume-relative
names are partially qualified, either giving the path
relative to the root directory on the current volume, or
relative to the current directory of the specified volume.
The <b>file pathtype</b> command can be used to determine
the type of a given path.</p>

<h2>PATH SYNTAX
<a name="PATH SYNTAX"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The rules for
native names depend on the value reported in the Tcl array
element <b>tcl_platform(platform)</b>:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"

<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="6%">


<p><b>Unix</b></p></td>
<td width="9%"></td>
<td width="74%">


<p>On Unix and Apple MacOS X platforms, Tcl uses path names
where the components are separated by slashes. Path names
may be relative or absolute, and file names may contain any
character other than slash. The file names <b>.</b> and
<b>..</b> are special and refer to the current directory and
the parent of the current directory respectively. Multiple
adjacent slash characters are interpreted as a single
separator. Any number of trailing slash characters at the
end of a path are simply ignored, so the paths <b>foo</b>,
<b>foo/</b> and <b>foo//</b> are all identical, and in
particular <b>foo/</b> does not necessarily mean a directory
is being referred.</p></td></tr>

<p style="margin-left:26%; margin-top: 1em">The following

</table>

<p style="margin-left:26%; margin-top: 1em">On Microsoft
Windows platforms, Tcl supports both drive-relative and UNC
style names. Both <b>/</b> and <b>\</b> may be used as
directory separators in either type of name. Drive-relative
names consist of an optional drive specifier followed by an
absolute or relative path. UNC paths follow the general form
<b>\\servername\sharename\path\file</b>, but must at the
very least contain the server and share components, i.e.
<b>\\servername\sharename</b>. In both forms, the file names
<b>.</b> and <b>..</b> are special and refer to the current
directory and the parent of the current directory
respectively. The following examples illustrate various
forms of path names: <b><br>
\\Host\share/file</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:49%;">Absolute UNC path to a file
called <b>file</b> in the root directory of the export point
<b>share</b> on the host <b>Host</b>. Note that repeated use
of <b>file dirname</b> on this path will give
<b>//Host/share</b>, and will never give just
<b>//Host</b>.</p>

<h2>TILDE SUBSTITUTION
<a name="TILDE SUBSTITUTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In addition to
the file name rules described above, Tcl also supports
<i>csh</i>-style tilde substitution. If a file name starts
with a tilde, then the file name will be interpreted as if
the first element is replaced with the location of the home
directory for the given user. If the tilde is followed
immediately by a separator, then the <b>$HOME</b>
environment variable is substituted. Otherwise the
characters between the tilde and the next separator are
taken as a user name, which is used to retrieve the
user&rsquo;s home directory for substitution. This works on
Unix, MacOS X and Windows (except very old releases).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Old Windows
platforms do not support tilde substitution when a user name
follows the tilde. On these platforms, attempts to use a
tilde followed by a user name will generate an error that
the user does not exist when Tcl attempts to interpret that
part of the path or otherwise access the file. The behaviour
of these paths when not trying to interpret them is the same
as on Unix. File names that have a tilde without a user name
will be correctly substituted using the <b>$HOME</b>
environment variable, just like for Unix.</p>

<h2>PORTABILITY ISSUES
<a name="PORTABILITY ISSUES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Not all file
systems are case sensitive, so scripts should avoid code
that depends on the case of characters in a file name. In
addition, the character sets allowed on different devices
may differ, so scripts should choose file names that do not
contain special characters like: <b>&lt;&gt;:?&quot;/\|</b>.
The safest approach is to use names consisting of
alphanumeric characters only. Care should be taken with
filenames which contain spaces (common on Windows systems)
and filenames where the backslash is the directory separator
(Windows native path names). Also Windows 3.1 only supports
file names with a root of no more than 8 characters and an
extension of no more than 3 characters.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On Windows
platforms there are file and path length restrictions.
Complete paths or filenames longer than about 260 characters
will lead to errors in most file operations.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Another Windows
peculiarity is that any number of trailing dots
&ldquo;.&rdquo; in filenames are totally ignored, so, for
example, attempts to create a file or directory with a name
&ldquo;foo.&rdquo; will result in the creation of a
file/directory with name &ldquo;foo&rdquo;. This fact is
reflected in the results of <b>file normalize</b>.
Furthermore, a file name consisting only of dots
&ldquo;.........&rdquo; or dots with trailing characters
&ldquo;.....abc&rdquo; is illegal.</p>
