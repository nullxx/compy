<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This command
updates the index using the current content found in the
working tree, to prepare the content staged for the next
commit. It typically adds the current content of existing
paths as a whole, but with some options it can also be used
to add content with only part of the changes made to the
working tree files applied, or remove paths that do not
exist in the working tree anymore.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;index&quot; holds a snapshot of the content of the
working tree, and it is this snapshot that is taken as the
contents of the next commit. Thus after making any changes
to the working directory, and before running the commit
command, you must use the add command to add any new or
modified files to the index.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This command
can be performed multiple times before a commit. It only
adds the content of the specified file(s) at the time the
add command is run; if you want subsequent changes included
in the next commit, then you must run git add again to add
the new content to the index.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The git status
command can be used to obtain a summary of which files have
changes that are staged for the next commit.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The git add
command will not add ignored files by default. If any
ignored files were explicitly specified on the command line,
git add will fail with a list of ignored files. Ignored
files reached by directory recursion or filename globbing
performed by Git (quote your globs before the shell) will be
silently ignored. The <i>git add</i> command can be used to
add ignored files with the &minus;f (force) option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Please see
<b>git-commit</b>(1) for alternative ways to add content to
a commit.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&lt;pathspec&gt;...</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Files to add content from.
Fileglobs (e.g. *.c) can be given to add all matching files.
Also a leading directory name (e.g. dir to add dir/file1 and
dir/file2) can be given to add all files in the directory,
recursively.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;n,
&minus;&minus;dry&minus;run</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Don&rsquo;t actually add the
file(s), just show if they exist and/or will be ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;v,
&minus;&minus;verbose</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Be verbose.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;f,
&minus;&minus;force</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Allow adding otherwise ignored
files.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;i,
&minus;&minus;interactive</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Add modified contents in the
working tree interactively to the index. Optional path
arguments may be supplied to limit operation to a subset of
the working tree. See &ldquo;Interactive mode&rdquo; for
details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;p,
&minus;&minus;patch</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Interactively choose hunks of
patch between the index and the work tree and add them to
the index. This gives the user a chance to review the
difference before adding modified contents to the index.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This
effectively runs add &minus;&minus;interactive, but bypasses
the initial command menu and directly jumps to the patch
subcommand. See &ldquo;Interactive mode&rdquo; for
details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;e,
&minus;&minus;edit</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Open the diff vs. the index in
an editor and let the user edit it. After the editor was
closed, adjust the hunk headers and apply the patch to the
index.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The intent of
this option is to pick and choose lines of the patch to
apply, or even to modify the contents of lines to be staged.
This can be quicker and more flexible than using the
interactive hunk selector. However, it is easy to confuse
oneself and create a patch that does not apply to the index.
See EDITING PATCHES below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;u,
&minus;&minus;update</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Update the index just where it
already has an entry matching &lt;pathspec&gt;. This removes
as well as modifies index entries to match the working tree,
but adds no new files.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If no
&lt;pathspec&gt; is given, the current version of Git
defaults to &quot;.&quot;; in other words, update all
tracked files in the current directory and its
subdirectories. This default will change in a future version
of Git, hence the form without &lt;pathspec&gt; should not
be used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;A,
&minus;&minus;all,
&minus;&minus;no&minus;ignore&minus;removal</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Update the index not only where
the working tree has a file matching &lt;pathspec&gt; but
also where the index already has an entry. This adds,
modifies, and removes index entries to match the working
tree.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If no
&lt;pathspec&gt; is given, the current version of Git
defaults to &quot;.&quot;; in other words, update all files
in the current directory and its subdirectories. This
default will change in a future version of Git, hence the
form without &lt;pathspec&gt; should not be used.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;no&minus;all,
&minus;&minus;ignore&minus;removal</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Update the index by adding new
files that are unknown to the index and files modified in
the working tree, but ignore files that have been removed
from the working tree. This option is a no&minus;op when no
&lt;pathspec&gt; is used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This option is
primarily to help the current users of Git, whose &quot;git
add &lt;pathspec&gt;...&quot; ignores removed files. In
future versions of Git, &quot;git add
&lt;pathspec&gt;...&quot; will be a synonym to &quot;git add
&minus;A &lt;pathspec&gt;...&quot; and &quot;git add
&minus;&minus;ignore&minus;removal &lt;pathspec&gt;...&quot;
will behave like today&rsquo;s &quot;git add
&lt;pathspec&gt;...&quot;, ignoring removed files.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;N,
&minus;&minus;intent&minus;to&minus;add</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Record only the fact that the
path will be added later. An entry for the path is placed in
the index with no content. This is useful for, among other
things, showing the unstaged content of such files with git
diff and committing them with git commit &minus;a.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;refresh</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Don&rsquo;t add the file(s),
but only refresh their stat() information in the index.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;ignore&minus;errors</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">If some files could not be
added because of errors indexing them, do not abort the
operation, but continue adding the others. The command shall
still exit with non&minus;zero status. The configuration
variable add.ignoreErrors can be set to true to make this
the default behaviour.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;ignore&minus;missing</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This option can only be used
together with &minus;&minus;dry&minus;run. By using this
option the user can check if any of the given files would be
ignored, no matter if they are already present in the work
tree or not.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This option can be used to
separate command&minus;line options from the list of files,
(useful when filenames might be mistaken for
command&minus;line options).</p>

<h2>CONFIGURATION
<a name="CONFIGURATION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The optional
configuration variable core.excludesfile indicates a path to
a file containing patterns of file names to exclude from
git&minus;add, similar to $GIT_DIR/info/exclude. Patterns in
the exclude file are used in addition to those in
info/exclude. See <b>gitignore</b>(5).</p>

<h2>EXAMPLES
<a name="EXAMPLES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; Adds
content from all *.txt files under Documentation directory
and its subdirectories:</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">$ git add
Documentation/\*.txt</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that the
asterisk * is quoted from the shell in this example; this
lets the command include the files from subdirectories of
Documentation/ directory.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
Considers adding content from all git&minus;*.sh
scripts:</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">$ git add
git&minus;*.sh</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Because this
example lets the shell expand the asterisk (i.e. you are
listing the files explicitly), it does not consider
subdir/git&minus;foo.sh.</p>

<h2>INTERACTIVE MODE
<a name="INTERACTIVE MODE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When the
command enters the interactive mode, it shows the output of
the <i>status</i> subcommand, and then goes into its
interactive command loop.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The command
loop shows the list of subcommands available, and gives a
prompt &quot;What now&gt; &quot;. In general, when the
prompt ends with a single <i>&gt;</i>, you can pick only one
of the choices given and type return, like this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">*** Commands
*** <br>
1: status 2: update 3: revert 4: add untracked <br>
5: patch 6: diff 7: quit 8: help <br>
What now&gt; 1</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You also could
say s or sta or status above as long as the choice is
unique.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The main
command loop has 6 subcommands (plus help and quit).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">status</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This shows the change between
HEAD and index (i.e. what will be committed if you say git
commit), and between index and working tree files (i.e. what
you could stage further before git commit using git add) for
each path. A sample output looks like this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">staged unstaged
path <br>
1: binary nothing foo.png <br>
2: +403/&minus;35 +1/&minus;1
git&minus;add&minus;&minus;interactive.perl</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">It shows that
foo.png has differences from HEAD (but that is binary so
line count cannot be shown) and there is no difference
between indexed copy and the working tree version (if the
working tree version were also different, <i>binary</i>
would have been shown in place of <i>nothing</i>). The other
file, git&minus;add&minus;&minus;interactive.perl, has 403
lines added and 35 lines deleted if you commit what is in
the index, but working tree file has further modifications
(one addition and one deletion).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">update</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This shows the status
information and issues an &quot;Update&gt;&gt;&quot; prompt.
When the prompt ends with double <i>&gt;&gt;</i>, you can
make more than one selection, concatenated with whitespace
or comma. Also you can say ranges. E.g. &quot;2&minus;5
7,9&quot; to choose 2,3,4,5,7,9 from the list. If the second
number in a range is omitted, all remaining patches are
taken. E.g. &quot;7&minus;&quot; to choose 7,8,9 from the
list. You can say <i>*</i> to choose everything.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">What you chose
are then highlighted with <i>*</i>, like this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">staged unstaged
path <br>
1: binary nothing foo.png <br>
* 2: +403/&minus;35 +1/&minus;1
git&minus;add&minus;&minus;interactive.perl</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">To remove
selection, prefix the input with &minus; like this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">Update&gt;&gt;
&minus;2</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">After making
the selection, answer with an empty line to stage the
contents of working tree files for selected paths in the
index.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">revert</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This has a very similar UI to
<i>update</i>, and the staged information for selected paths
are reverted to that of the HEAD version. Reverting new
paths makes them untracked.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">add
untracked</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This has a very similar UI to
<i>update</i> and <i>revert</i>, and lets you add untracked
paths to the index.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">patch</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This lets you choose one path
out of a <i>status</i> like selection. After choosing the
path, it presents the diff between the index and the working
tree file and asks you if you want to stage the change of
each hunk. You can select one of the following options and
type return:</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">y &minus; stage
this hunk <br>
n &minus; do not stage this hunk <br>
q &minus; quit; do not stage this hunk nor any of the
remaining ones <br>
a &minus; stage this hunk and all later hunks in the file
<br>
d &minus; do not stage this hunk nor any of the later hunks
in the file <br>
g &minus; select a hunk to go to <br>
/ &minus; search for a hunk matching the given regex <br>
j &minus; leave this hunk undecided, see next undecided hunk
<br>
J &minus; leave this hunk undecided, see next hunk <br>
k &minus; leave this hunk undecided, see previous undecided
hunk <br>
K &minus; leave this hunk undecided, see previous hunk <br>
s &minus; split the current hunk into smaller hunks <br>
e &minus; manually edit the current hunk <br>
? &minus; print help</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">After deciding
the fate for all hunks, if there is any hunk that was
chosen, the index is updated with the selected hunks.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">You can omit
having to type return here, by setting the configuration
variable interactive.singlekey to true.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">diff</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This lets you review what will
be committed (i.e. between HEAD and index).</p>

<h2>EDITING PATCHES
<a name="EDITING PATCHES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Invoking git
add &minus;e or selecting e from the interactive hunk
selector will open a patch in your editor; after the editor
exits, the result is applied to the index. You are free to
make arbitrary changes to the patch, but note that some
changes may have confusing results, or even result in a
patch that cannot be applied. If you want to abort the
operation entirely (i.e., stage nothing new in the index),
simply delete all lines of the patch. The list below
describes some common things you may see in a patch, and
which editing operations make sense on them.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">added
content</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Added content is represented by
lines beginning with &quot;+&quot;. You can prevent staging
any addition lines by deleting them.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">removed
content</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Removed content is represented
by lines beginning with &quot;&minus;&quot;. You can prevent
staging their removal by converting the &quot;&minus;&quot;
to a &quot; &quot; (space).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">modified
content</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Modified content is represented
by &quot;&minus;&quot; lines (removing the old content)
followed by &quot;+&quot; lines (adding the replacement
content). You can prevent staging the modification by
converting &quot;&minus;&quot; lines to &quot; &quot;, and
removing &quot;+&quot; lines. Beware that modifying only
half of the pair is likely to introduce confusing changes to
the index.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There are also
more complex operations that can be performed. But beware
that because the patch is applied only to the index and not
the working tree, the working tree will appear to
&quot;undo&quot; the change in the index. For example,
introducing a new line into the index that is in neither the
HEAD nor the working tree will stage the new line for
commit, but the line will appear to be reverted in the
working tree.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Avoid using
these constructs, or do so with extreme caution.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">removing
untouched content</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Content which does not differ
between the index and working tree may be shown on context
lines, beginning with a &quot; &quot; (space). You can stage
context lines for removal by converting the space to a
&quot;&minus;&quot;. The resulting working tree file will
appear to re&minus;add the content.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">modifying
existing content</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">One can also modify context
lines by staging them for removal (by converting &quot;
&quot; to &quot;&minus;&quot;) and adding a &quot;+&quot;
line with the new content. Similarly, one can modify
&quot;+&quot; lines for existing additions or modifications.
In all cases, the new modification will appear reverted in
the working tree.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">new content</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">You may also add new content
that does not exist in the patch; simply add new lines, each
starting with &quot;+&quot;. The addition will appear
reverted in the working tree.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There are also
several operations which should be avoided entirely, as they
will make the patch impossible to apply:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; adding
context (&quot; &quot;) or removal (&quot;&minus;&quot;)
lines</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; deleting
context or removal lines</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
modifying the contents of context or removal lines</p>
