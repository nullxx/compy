<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For
<i>exit</i>() and <i>_Exit</i>(): The functionality
described on this reference page is aligned with the
ISO&nbsp;C standard. Any conflict between the requirements
described here and the ISO&nbsp;C standard is unintentional.
This volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 defers to the
ISO&nbsp;C standard.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The value of
<i>status</i> may be 0, EXIT_SUCCESS, EXIT_FAILURE, &nbsp;or
any other value, though only the least significant 8 bits
(that is, <i>status</i> &amp; 0377) shall be available to a
waiting parent process.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>exit</i>() function shall first call all functions
registered by <i>atexit</i>(), in the reverse order of their
registration, except that a function is called after any
previously registered functions that had already been called
at the time it was registered. Each function is called as
many times as it was registered. If, during the call to any
such function, a call to the <i>longjmp</i>() function is
made that would terminate the call to the registered
function, the behavior is undefined.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If a function
registered by a call to <i>atexit</i>() fails to return, the
remaining registered functions shall not be called and the
rest of the <i>exit</i>() processing shall not be completed.
If <i>exit</i>() is called more than once, the behavior is
undefined.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>exit</i>() function shall then flush all open streams
with unwritten buffered data, close all open streams, and
remove all files created by <i>tmpfile</i>(). Finally,
control shall be terminated with the consequences described
below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>_Exit</i>() and <i>_exit</i>() functions shall be
functionally equivalent.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>_Exit</i>() and <i>_exit</i>() functions shall not call
functions registered with <i>atexit</i>() nor any registered
signal handlers. Whether open streams are flushed or closed,
or temporary files are removed is implementation-defined.
Finally, the calling process is terminated with the
consequences described below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These functions
shall terminate the calling process with the following

<h2>RATIONALE
<a name="RATIONALE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Process
Termination</b> <br>
Early proposals drew a distinction between normal and
abnormal process termination. Abnormal termination was
caused only by certain signals and resulted in
implementation-defined &quot;actions&quot;, as discussed
below. Subsequent proposals distinguished three types of
termination: <i>normal termination</i> (as in the current
specification), <i>simple abnormal termination</i>, and
<i>abnormal termination with actions</i>. Again the
distinction between the two types of abnormal termination
was that they were caused by different signals and that
implementation-defined actions would result in the latter
case. Given that these actions were completely
implementation-defined, the early proposals were only saying
when the actions could occur and how their occurrence could
be detected, but not what they were. This was of little or
no use to conforming applications, and thus the distinction
is not made in this volume of
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
implementation-defined actions usually include, in most
historical implementations, the creation of a file named
<b>core</b> in the current working directory of the process.
This file contains an image of the memory of the process,
together with descriptive information about the process,
perhaps sufficient to reconstruct the state of the process
at the receipt of the signal.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There is a
potential security problem in creating a <b>core</b> file if
the process was set-user-ID and the current user is not the
owner of the program, if the process was set-group-ID and
none of the user&rsquo;s groups match the group of the
program, or if the user does not have permission to write in
the current directory. In this situation, an implementation
either should not create a <b>core</b> file or should make
it unreadable by the user.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Despite the
silence of this volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 on
this feature, applications are advised not to create files
named <b>core</b> because of potential conflicts in many
implementations. Some implementations use a name other than
<b>core</b> for the file; for example, by appending the
process ID to the filename.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Terminating
a Process</b> <br>
It is important that the consequences of process termination
as described occur regardless of whether the process called
<i>_exit</i>() (perhaps indirectly through <i>exit</i>()) or
instead was terminated due to a signal or for some other
reason. Note that in the specific case of <i>exit</i>() this
means that the <i>status</i> argument to <i>exit</i>() is
treated in the same way as the <i>status</i> argument to
<i>_exit</i>().</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A language
other than C may have other termination primitives than the
C-language <i>exit</i>() function, and programs written in
such a language should use its native termination
primitives, but those should have as part of their function
the behavior of <i>_exit</i>() as described. Implementations
in languages other than C are outside the scope of this
version of this volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001,
however.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As required by
the ISO&nbsp;C standard, using <b>return</b> from
<i>main</i>() has the same behavior (other than with respect
to language scope issues) as calling <i>exit</i>() with the
returned value. Reaching the end of the <i>main</i>()
function has the same behavior as calling
<i>exit</i>(0).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A value of zero
(or EXIT_SUCCESS, which is required to be zero) for the
argument <i>status</i> conventionally indicates successful
termination. This corresponds to the specification for
<i>exit</i>() in the ISO&nbsp;C standard. The convention is
followed by utilities such as <i>make</i> and various
shells, which interpret a zero status from a child process
as success. For this reason, applications should not call
<i>exit</i>(0) or <i>_exit</i>(0) when they terminate
unsuccessfully; for example, in signal-catching
functions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Historically,
the implementation-defined process that inherits children
whose parents have terminated without waiting on them is
called <i>init</i> and has a process ID of 1.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The sending of
a SIGHUP to the foreground process group when a controlling
process terminates corresponds to somewhat different
historical implementations. In System V, the kernel sends a
SIGHUP on termination of (essentially) a controlling
process. In 4.2 BSD, the kernel does not send SIGHUP in a
case like this, but the termination of a controlling process
is usually noticed by a system daemon, which arranges to
send a SIGHUP to the foreground process group with the
<i>vhangup</i>() function. However, in 4.2 BSD, due to the
behavior of the shells that support job control, the
controlling process is usually a shell with no other
processes in its process group. Thus, a change to make
<i>_exit</i>() behave this way in such systems should not
cause problems with existing applications.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The termination
of a process may cause a process group to become orphaned in
either of two ways. The connection of a process group to its
parent(s) outside of the group depends on both the parents
and their children. Thus, a process group may be orphaned by
the termination of the last connecting parent process
outside of the group or by the termination of the last
direct descendant of the parent process(es). In either case,
if the termination of a process causes a process group to
become orphaned, processes within the group are disconnected
from their job control shell, which no longer has any
information on the existence of the process group. Stopped
processes within the group would languish forever. In order
to avoid this problem, newly orphaned process groups that
contain stopped processes are sent a SIGHUP signal and a
SIGCONT signal to indicate that they have been disconnected
from their session. The SIGHUP signal causes the process
group members to terminate unless they are catching or
ignoring SIGHUP. Under most circumstances, all of the
members of the process group are stopped if any of them are
stopped.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The action of
sending a SIGHUP and a SIGCONT signal to members of a newly
orphaned process group is similar to the action of 4.2 BSD,
which sends SIGHUP and SIGCONT to each stopped child of an
exiting process. If such children exit in response to the
SIGHUP, any additional descendants receive similar treatment
at that time. In this volume of
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001, the signals are sent to the
entire process group at the same time. Also, in this volume
of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001, but not in 4.2 BSD,
stopped processes may be orphaned, but may be members of a
process group that is not orphaned; therefore, the action
taken at <i>_exit</i>() must consider processes other than
child processes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is possible
for a process group to be orphaned by a call to
<i>setpgid</i>() or <i>setsid</i>(), as well as by process
termination. This volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001
does not require sending SIGHUP and SIGCONT in those cases,
because, unlike process termination, those cases are not
caused accidentally by applications that are unaware of job
control. An implementation can choose to send SIGHUP and
SIGCONT in those cases as an extension; such an extension
must be documented as required in
<i>&lt;signal.h&gt;</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
ISO/IEC&nbsp;9899:1999 standard adds the <i>_Exit</i>()
function that results in immediate program termination
without triggering signals or <i>atexit</i>()-registered
functions. In IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001, this is
equivalent to the <i>_exit</i>() function.</p>
