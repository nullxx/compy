<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This command
treats its arguments as the specification of one or more
subprocesses to execute. The arguments take the form of a
standard shell pipeline where each <i>arg</i> becomes one
word of a command, and each distinct command becomes a
subprocess.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the initial
arguments to <b>exec</b> start with <b>&minus;</b> then they
are treated as command-line switches and are not part of the
pipeline specification. The following switches are currently
supported: <b><br>
&minus;ignorestderr</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:31%;">Stops the <b>exec</b> command
from treating the output of <big>&#9474;</big> messages to
the pipeline&rsquo;s standard error channel as an
<big>&#9474;</big> error case.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If an
<i>arg</i> (or pair of <i>arg</i>s) has one of the forms
described below then it is used by <b>exec</b> to control
the flow of input and output among the subprocess(es). Such
arguments will not be passed to the subprocess(es). In forms
such as &ldquo;<b>&lt;</b> <i>fileName</i>&rdquo;,
<i>fileName</i> may either be in a separate argument from
&ldquo;<b>&lt;</b>&rdquo; or in the same argument with no
intervening space (i.e.
&ldquo;<b>&lt;</b><i>fileName</i>&rdquo;).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If standard
output has not been redirected then the <b>exec</b> command
returns the standard output from the last command in the
pipeline, <big>&#9474;</big> unless &ldquo;2&gt;@1&rdquo;
was specified, in which case standard error is included
<big>&#9474;</big> as well. If any of the commands in the
pipeline exit abnormally or are killed or suspended, then
<b>exec</b> will return an error and the error message will
include the pipeline&rsquo;s output followed by error
messages describing the abnormal terminations; the
<b>&minus;errorcode</b> return option will contain
additional information about the last abnormal termination
encountered. If any of the commands writes to its standard
error file and that standard error is not redirected and
<b>&minus;ignorestderr</b> is not <big>&#9474;</big>
specified, then <b>exec</b> will return an error; the error
message will include the pipeline&rsquo;s standard output,
followed by messages about abnormal terminations (if any),
followed by the standard error output.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the last
character of the result or error message is a newline then
that character is normally deleted from the result or error
message. This is consistent with other Tcl return values,
which do not normally end with newlines. However, if
<b>&minus;keepnewline</b> is specified then the trailing
newline is retained.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If standard
input is not redirected with &ldquo;&lt;&rdquo;,
&ldquo;&lt;&lt;&rdquo; or &ldquo;&lt;@&rdquo; then the
standard input for the first command in the pipeline is
taken from the application&rsquo;s current standard
input.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the last
<i>arg</i> is &ldquo;&amp;&rdquo; then the pipeline will be
executed in background. In this case the <b>exec</b> command
will return a list whose elements are the process
identifiers for all of the subprocesses in the pipeline. The
standard output from the last command in the pipeline will
go to the application&rsquo;s standard output if it has not
been redirected, and error output from all of the commands
in the pipeline will go to the application&rsquo;s standard
error file unless redirected.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The first word
in each command is taken as the command name;
tilde-substitution is performed on it, and if the result
contains no slashes then the directories in the PATH
environment variable are searched for an executable by the
given name. If the name contains a slash then it must refer
to an executable reachable from the current directory. No
&ldquo;glob&rdquo; expansion or other shell-like
substitutions are performed on the arguments to
commands.</p>

<h2>PORTABILITY ISSUES
<a name="PORTABILITY ISSUES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Windows</b>
(all versions)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Reading from or writing to a
socket, using the &ldquo;<b>@</b> <i>fileId</i>&rdquo;
notation, does not work. When reading from a socket, a
16-bit DOS application will hang and a 32-bit application
will return immediately with end-of-file. When either type
of application writes to a socket, the information is
instead sent to the console, if one is present, or is
discarded.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The Tk console
text widget does not provide real standard IO capabilities.
Under Tk, when redirecting from standard input, all
applications will see an immediate end-of-file; information
redirected to standard output or standard error will be
discarded.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Either forward
or backward slashes are accepted as path separators for
arguments to Tcl commands. When executing an application,
the path name specified for the application may also contain
forward or backward slashes as path separators. Bear in
mind, however, that most Windows applications accept
arguments with forward slashes only as option delimiters and
backslashes only in paths. Any arguments to an application
that specify a path name with forward slashes will not
automatically be converted to use the backslash character.
If an argument contains forward slashes as the path
separator, it may or may not be recognized as a path name,
depending on the program.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Additionally,
when calling a 16-bit DOS or Windows 3.X application, all
path names must use the short, cryptic, path format (e.g.,
using &ldquo;applba~1.def&rdquo; instead of
&ldquo;applbakery.default&rdquo;), which can be obtained
with the &ldquo;<b>file attributes</b> <i>fileName</i>
<b>&minus;shortname</b>&rdquo; command.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Two or more
forward or backward slashes in a row in a path refer to a
network path. For example, a simple concatenation of the
root directory <b>c:/</b> with a subdirectory
<b>/windows/system</b> will yield <b>c://windows/system</b>
(two slashes together), which refers to the mount point
called <b>system</b> on the machine called <b>windows</b>
(and the <b>c:/</b> is ignored), and is not equivalent to
<b>c:/windows/system</b>, which describes a directory on the
current computer. The <b>file join</b> command should be
used to concatenate path components.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Note that there
are two general types of Win32 console applications:</p>

<p>TUI &mdash; Textmode User Interface, any application
that accesses the console API for doing such things as
cursor movement, setting text color, detecting key presses
and mouse movement, etc. An example would be
<b>telnet.exe</b> from Windows 2000. These types of
applications are not common in a windows environment, but do
exist.</p> </td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>exec</b>
will not work well with TUI applications when a console is
not present, as is done when launching applications under
wish. It is desirable to have console applications hidden
and detached. This is a designed-in limitation as
<b>exec</b> wants to communicate over pipes. The Expect
extension addresses this issue when communicating with a TUI
application.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Windows NT</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">When attempting to execute an
application, <b>exec</b> first searches for the name as it
was specified. Then, in order, <b>.com</b>, <b>.exe</b>, and

not specified as part of the application name, the following
directories are automatically searched in order when

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Once a 16-bit
DOS application has read standard input from a console and
then quit, all subsequently run 16-bit DOS applications will
see the standard input as already closed. 32-bit
applications do not have this problem and will run
correctly, even after a 16-bit DOS application thinks that
standard input is closed. There is no known workaround for
this bug at this time.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Redirection
between the <b>NUL:</b> device and a 16-bit application does
not always work. When redirecting from <b>NUL:</b>, some
applications may hang, others will get an infinite stream of
&ldquo;0x01&rdquo; bytes, and some will actually correctly
get an immediate end-of-file; the behavior seems to depend
upon something compiled into the application itself. When
redirecting greater than 4K or so to <b>NUL:</b>, some
applications will hang. The above problems do not happen
with 32-bit applications.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">All DOS 16-bit
applications are run synchronously. All standard input from
a pipe to a 16-bit DOS application is collected into a
temporary file; the other end of the pipe must be closed
before the 16-bit DOS application begins executing. All
standard output or error from a 16-bit DOS application to a
pipe is collected into temporary files; the application must
terminate before the temporary files are redirected to the
next stage of the pipeline. This is due to a workaround for
a Windows 95 bug in the implementation of pipes, and is how
the standard Windows 95 DOS shell handles pipes itself.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Certain
applications, such as <b>command.com</b>, should not be
executed interactively. Applications which directly access
the console window, rather than reading from their standard
input and writing to their standard output may fail, hang
Tcl, or even hang the system if their own private console
window is not available to them.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Unix</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The <b>exec</b> command is
fully functional and works as described.</p>

<h2>UNIX EXAMPLES
<a name="UNIX EXAMPLES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Here are some
examples of the use of the <b>exec</b> command on Unix.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To execute a
simple program and get its result:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>exec</b> uname -a</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To execute a
program that can return a non-zero result, you should wrap
the call to <b>exec</b> in <b>catch</b> and check the
contents of the <b>&minus;errorcode</b> return option if you
have an error:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">set status 0 <br>
if {[catch {<b>exec</b> grep foo bar.txt} results options]}
{ <br>
set details [dict get $options -errorcode] <br>
if {[lindex $details 0] eq &quot;CHILDSTATUS&quot;} { <br>
set status [lindex $details 2] <br>
} else { <br>
# Some kind of unexpected failure <br>
} <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When
translating a command from a Unix shell invocation, care
should be taken over the fact that single quote characters
have no special significance to Tcl. Thus:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">awk &rsquo;{sum += $1} END
{print sum}&rsquo; numbers.list</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">would be translated into
something like:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>exec</b> awk {{sum += $1}
END {print sum}} numbers.list</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you are
converting invocations involving shell globbing, you should
remember that Tcl does not handle globbing or expand things
into multiple arguments by default. Instead you should write
things like this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>exec</b> ls -l {*}[glob
*.tcl]</p>

<h2>WINDOWS EXAMPLES
<a name="WINDOWS EXAMPLES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Here are some
examples of the use of the <b>exec</b> command on
Windows.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To start an
instance of <i>notepad</i> editing a file without waiting
for the user to finish editing the file:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>exec</b> notepad myfile.txt
&amp;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To print a text
file using <i>notepad</i>:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>exec</b> notepad /p
myfile.txt</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If a program
calls other programs, such as is common with compilers, then
you may need to resort to batch files to hide the console
windows that sometimes pop up:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>exec</b> cmp.bat somefile.c
-o somefile</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">With the file <i>cmp.bat</i>
looking something like:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">@gcc %1 %2 %3 %4 %5 %6 %7 %8
%9</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Sometimes you
need to be careful, as different programs may have the same
name and be in the path. It can then happen that typing a
command at the DOS prompt finds <i>a different program</i>
than the same command run via <b>exec</b>. This is because
of the (documented) differences in behaviour between
<b>exec</b> and DOS batch files.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When in doubt,
use the command <b>auto_execok</b>: it will return the
complete path to the program as seen by the <b>exec</b>
command. This applies especially when you want to run
&ldquo;internal&rdquo; commands like <i>dir</i> from a Tcl
script (if you just want to list filenames, use the
<b>glob</b> command.) To do that, use this:</p>
