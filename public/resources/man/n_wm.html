</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>wm</b>
<i>option window</i> ?<i>args</i>?
_________________________________________________________________</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The <b>wm</b>
command is used to interact with window managers in order to
control such things as the title for a window, its geometry,
or the increments in terms of which it may be resized. The
<b>wm</b> command can take any of a number of different
forms, depending on the <i>option</i> argument. All of the
forms expect at least one additional argument,
<i>window</i>, which must be the path name of a top-level
window.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The legal forms
for the <b>wm</b> command are: <b><br>
wm aspect</b> <i>window</i> ?<i>minNumer minDenom maxNumer
maxDenom</i>?</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If <i>minNumer</i>,
<i>minDenom</i>, <i>maxNumer</i>, and <i>maxDenom</i> are
all specified, then they will be passed to the window
manager and the window manager should use them to enforce a
range of acceptable aspect ratios for <i>window</i>. The
aspect ratio of <i>window</i> (width/length) will be
constrained to lie between <i>minNumer</i>/<i>minDenom</i>
and <i>maxNumer</i>/<i>maxDenom</i>. If <i>minNumer</i> etc.
are all specified as empty strings, then any existing aspect
ratio restrictions are removed. If <i>minNumer</i> etc. are
specified, then the command returns an empty string.
Otherwise, it returns a Tcl list containing four elements,
which are the current values of <i>minNumer</i>,
<i>minDenom</i>, <i>maxNumer</i>, and <i>maxDenom</i> (if no
aspect restrictions are in effect, then an empty string is
returned).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>wm attributes</b>
<i>window</i> <b><br>
wm attributes</b> <i>window</i> ?<b>option</b>? <b><br>
wm attributes</b> <i>window</i> ?<b>option value option
value...</b>?</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This subcommand returns or sets
platform specific attributes associated with a window. The
first form returns a list of the platform specific flags and
their values. The second form returns the value for the
specific option. The third form sets one or more of the
values. The values are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">All platforms
support the following attributes (though X11 users should
see the notes below): <b><br>
&minus;fullscreen</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Places the window in a mode
that takes up the entire screen, has no borders, and covers
the general use area (i.e. Start menu and taskbar on
Windows, dock and menubar on OSX, general window decorations
on X11).</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>&minus;topmost</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Specifies whether this is a
topmost window (displays above all other windows).</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">On Windows, the
following attributes may be set.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="22%"></td>
<td width="9%">


<p><b>&minus;alpha</b></p></td>
<td width="1%"></td>
<td width="68%">


<p>Specifies the alpha transparency level of the toplevel.
<big>&#9474;</big> It accepts a value from <b>0.0</b> (fully
transparent) to <b>1.0</b> <big>&#9474;</big> (opaque).
Values outside that range will be constrained.
<big>&#9474;</big> This is supported on Windows 2000/XP+.
Where not <big>&#9474;</big> supported, the
<b>&minus;alpha</b> value remains at <b>1.0</b>.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>&minus;disabled</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Specifies whether the window is
in a disabled state.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>&minus;toolwindow</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Specifies a toolwindow style
window (as defined in the MSDN).</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>&minus;transparentcolor</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Specifies the transparent color
index of the toplevel. <big>&#9474;</big> It takes any color
value accepted by <b>Tk_GetColor</b>. If the
<big>&#9474;</big> empty string is specified (default), no
transparent color <big>&#9474;</big> is used. This is
supported on Windows 2000/XP+. Where <big>&#9474;</big> not
supported, the <b>&minus;transparentcolor</b> value remains
at <b>{}</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">On Mac OS X,
the following attributes may be set.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="22%"></td>
<td width="9%">


<p><b>&minus;alpha</b></p></td>
<td width="1%"></td>
<td width="68%">


<p>Specifies the alpha transparency level of the window. It
accepts a value from <b>0.0</b> (fully transparent) to
<b>1.0</b> (opaque), values outside that range will be
constrained.</p> </td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>&minus;modified</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Specifies the modification
state of the window (determines whether the window close
widget contains the modification indicator and whether the
proxy icon is draggable).</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>&minus;notify</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Specifies process notification
state (bouncing of the application dock icon).</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>&minus;titlepath</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Specifies the path of the file
referenced as the window proxy icon (which can be dragged
and dropped in lieu of the file&rsquo;s finder icon).</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>&minus;transparent</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Makes the window content area
transparent and turns off the window shadow. For the
transparency to be effecive, the toplevel background needs
to be set to a color with some alpha, e.g.
&ldquo;systemTransparent&rdquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">On X11, the
following attributes may be set. These are not supported by
all window managers, and will have no effect under older
WMs. <b><br>
&minus;zoomed</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Requests that the window should
be maximized. This is the same as <b>wm state zoomed</b> on
Windows and Mac OS X.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">On X11, changes
to window attributes are performed asynchronously. Querying
the value of an attribute returns the current state, which
will not be the same as the value most recently set if the
window manager has not yet processed the request or if it
does not support the attribute.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>wm client</b> <i>window</i>
?<i>name</i>?</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If <i>name</i> is specified,
this command stores <i>name</i> (which should be the name of
the host on which the application is executing) in
<i>window</i>&rsquo;s <b>WM_CLIENT_MACHINE</b> property for
use by the window manager or session manager. The command
returns an empty string in this case. If <i>name</i> is not
specified, the command returns the last name set in a <b>wm
client</b> command for <i>window</i>. If <i>name</i> is
specified as an empty string, the command deletes the
<b>WM_CLIENT_MACHINE</b> property from <i>window</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>wm colormapwindows</b>
<i>window</i> ?<i>windowList</i>?</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This command is used to
manipulate the <b>WM_COLORMAP_WINDOWS</b> property, which
provides information to the window managers about windows
that have private colormaps.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If
<i>windowList</i> is not specified, the command returns a
list whose elements are the names of the windows in the
<b>WM_COLORMAP_WINDOWS</b> property. If <i>windowList</i> is
specified, it consists of a list of window path names; the
command overwrites the <b>WM_COLORMAP_WINDOWS</b> property
with the given windows and returns an empty string. The
<b>WM_COLORMAP_WINDOWS</b> property should normally contain
a list of the internal windows within <i>window</i> whose
colormaps differ from their parents.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The order of
the windows in the property indicates a priority order: the
window manager will attempt to install as many colormaps as
possible from the head of this list when <i>window</i> gets
the colormap focus. If <i>window</i> is not included among
the windows in <i>windowList</i>, Tk implicitly adds it at
the end of the <b>WM_COLORMAP_WINDOWS</b> property, so that
its colormap is lowest in priority. If <b>wm
colormapwindows</b> is not invoked, Tk will automatically
set the property for each top-level window to all the
internal windows whose colormaps differ from their parents,
followed by the top-level itself; the order of the internal
windows is undefined. See the ICCCM documentation for more
information on the <b>WM_COLORMAP_WINDOWS</b> property.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>wm command</b> <i>window</i>
?<i>value</i>?</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If <i>value</i> is specified,
this command stores <i>value</i> in <i>window</i>&rsquo;s
<b>WM_COMMAND</b> property for use by the window manager or
session manager and returns an empty string. <i>Value</i>
must have proper list structure; the elements should contain
the words of the command used to invoke the application. If
<i>value</i> is not specified then the command returns the
last value set in a <b>wm command</b> command for
<i>window</i>. If <i>value</i> is specified as an empty
string, the command deletes the <b>WM_COMMAND</b> property
from <i>window</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>wm deiconify</b>
<i>window</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Arrange for <i>window</i> to be
displayed in normal (non-iconified) form. This is done by
mapping the window. If the window has never been mapped then
this command will not map the window, but it will ensure
that when the window is first mapped it will be displayed in
de-iconified form. On Windows, a deiconified window will
also be raised and be given the focus (made the active
window). Returns an empty string.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>wm focusmodel</b>
<i>window</i> ?<b>active</b>|<b>passive</b>?</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If <b>active</b> or
<b>passive</b> is supplied as an optional argument to the
command, then it specifies the focus model for
<i>window</i>. In this case the command returns an empty
string. If no additional argument is supplied, then the
command returns the current focus model for
<i>window</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">An
<b>active</b> focus model means that <i>window</i> will
claim the input focus for itself or its descendants, even at
times when the focus is currently in some other application.
<b>Passive</b> means that <i>window</i> will never claim the
focus for itself: the window manager should give the focus
to <i>window</i> at appropriate times. However, once the
focus has been given to <i>window</i> or one of its
descendants, the application may re-assign the focus among
<i>window</i>&rsquo;s descendants. The focus model defaults
to <b>passive</b>, and Tk&rsquo;s <b>focus</b> command
assumes a passive model of focusing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>wm forget</b>
<i>window</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The <i>window</i> will be
unmapped from the screen and will no longer be managed by
<b>wm</b>. Windows created with the <b>toplevel</b> command
will be treated like <b>frame</b> windows once they are no
longer managed by <b>wm</b>, however, the <b>&minus;menu</b>
configuration will be remembered and the menus will return
once the widget is managed again.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>wm frame</b>
<i>window</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If <i>window</i> has been
reparented by the window manager into a decorative frame,
the command returns the platform specific window identifier
for the outermost frame that contains <i>window</i> (the
window whose parent is the root or virtual root). If
<i>window</i> has not been reparented by the window manager
then the command returns the platform specific window
identifier for <i>window</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>wm geometry</b>
<i>window</i> ?<i>newGeometry</i>?</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If <i>newGeometry</i> is
specified, then the geometry of <i>window</i> is changed and
an empty string is returned. Otherwise the current geometry
for <i>window</i> is returned (this is the most recent
geometry specified either by manual resizing or in a <b>wm
geometry</b> command). <i>NewGeometry</i> has the form
<b>=</b><i>width</i><b>x</b><i>height</i><b>&plusmn;</b><i>x</i><b>&plusmn;</b><i>y</i>,
where any of <b>=</b>, <i>width</i><b>x</b><i>height</i>, or
<b>&plusmn;</b><i>x</i><b>&plusmn;</b><i>y</i> may be
omitted. <i>Width</i> and <i>height</i> are positive
integers specifying the desired dimensions of <i>window</i>.
If <i>window</i> is gridded (see <b>GRIDDED GEOMETRY
MANAGEMENT</b> below) then the dimensions are specified in
grid units; otherwise they are specified in pixel units.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><i>X</i> and
<i>y</i> specify the desired location of <i>window</i> on
the screen, in pixels. If <i>x</i> is preceded by <b>+</b>,
it specifies the number of pixels between the left edge of
the screen and the left edge of <i>window</i>&rsquo;s
border; if preceded by <b>&minus;</b> then <i>x</i>
specifies the number of pixels between the right edge of the
screen and the right edge of <i>window</i>&rsquo;s border.
If <i>y</i> is preceded by <b>+</b> then it specifies the
number of pixels between the top of the screen and the top
of <i>window</i>&rsquo;s border; if <i>y</i> is preceded by
<b>&minus;</b> then it specifies the number of pixels
between the bottom of <i>window</i>&rsquo;s border and the
bottom of the screen.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If
<i>newGeometry</i> is specified as an empty string then any
existing user-specified geometry for <i>window</i> is
cancelled, and the window will revert to the size requested
internally by its widgets.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Note that this
is related to <b>winfo geometry</b>, but not the same. That
can only query the geometry, and always reflects Tk&rsquo;s
current understanding of the actual size and location of
<i>window</i>, whereas <b>wm geometry</b> allows both
setting and querying of the <i>window manager</i>&rsquo;s
understanding of the size and location of the window. This
can vary significantly, for example to reflect the addition
of decorative elements to <i>window</i> such as title bars,
and window managers are not required to precisely follow the
requests made through this command.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>wm grid</b> <i>window</i>
?<i>baseWidth baseHeight widthInc heightInc</i>?</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This command indicates that
<i>window</i> is to be managed as a gridded window. It also
specifies the relationship between grid units and pixel
units. <i>BaseWidth</i> and <i>baseHeight</i> specify the
number of grid units corresponding to the pixel dimensions
requested internally by <i>window</i> using
<b>Tk_GeometryRequest</b>. <i>WidthInc</i> and
<i>heightInc</i> specify the number of pixels in each
horizontal and vertical grid unit. These four values
determine a range of acceptable sizes for <i>window</i>,
corresponding to grid-based widths and heights that are
non-negative integers. Tk will pass this information to the
window manager; during manual resizing, the window manager
will restrict the window&rsquo;s size to one of these
acceptable sizes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Furthermore,
during manual resizing the window manager will display the
window&rsquo;s current size in terms of grid units rather
than pixels. If <i>baseWidth</i> etc. are all specified as
empty strings, then <i>window</i> will no longer be managed
as a gridded window. If <i>baseWidth</i> etc. are specified
then the return value is an empty string.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Otherwise the
return value is a Tcl list containing four elements
corresponding to the current <i>baseWidth</i>,
<i>baseHeight</i>, <i>widthInc</i>, and <i>heightInc</i>; if
<i>window</i> is not currently gridded, then an empty string
is returned.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Note: this
command should not be needed very often, since the
<b>Tk_SetGrid</b> library procedure and the <b>setGrid</b>
option provide easier access to the same functionality.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>wm group</b> <i>window</i>
?<i>pathName</i>?</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If <i>pathName</i> is
specified, it gives the path name for the leader of a group
of related windows. The window manager may use this
information, for example, to unmap all of the windows in a
group when the group&rsquo;s leader is iconified.
<i>PathName</i> may be specified as an empty string to
remove <i>window</i> from any group association. If
<i>pathName</i> is specified then the command returns an
empty string; otherwise it returns the path name of
<i>window</i>&rsquo;s current group leader, or an empty
string if <i>window</i> is not part of any group.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>wm iconbitmap</b>
<i>window</i> ?<i>bitmap</i>?</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If <i>bitmap</i> is specified,
then it names a bitmap in the standard forms accepted by Tk
(see the <b>Tk_GetBitmap</b> manual entry for details). This
bitmap is passed to the window manager to be displayed in
<i>window</i>&rsquo;s icon, and the command returns an empty
string. If an empty string is specified for <i>bitmap</i>,
then any current icon bitmap is cancelled for <i>window</i>.
If <i>bitmap</i> is specified then the command returns an
empty string. Otherwise it returns the name of the current
icon bitmap associated with <i>window</i>, or an empty
string if <i>window</i> has no icon bitmap. On the Windows
operating system, an additional flag is supported: <b><br>
wm iconbitmap</b> <i>window</i> ?<b>&minus;default</b>?
?<i>image</i>?</p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">If the <b>&minus;default</b>
flag is given, the icon is applied to all toplevel windows
(existing and future) to which no other specific icon has
yet been applied. In addition to bitmap image types, a full
path specification to any file which contains a valid
Windows icon is also accepted (usually .ico or .icr files),
or any file for which the shell has assigned an icon. Tcl
will first test if the file contains an icon, then if it has
an assigned icon, and finally, if that fails, test for a
bitmap.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>wm iconify</b>
<i>window</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Arrange for <i>window</i> to be
iconified. It <i>window</i> has not yet been mapped for the
first time, this command will arrange for it to appear in
the iconified state when it is eventually mapped.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>wm iconmask</b>
<i>window</i> ?<i>bitmap</i>?</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If <i>bitmap</i> is specified,
then it names a bitmap in the standard forms accepted by Tk
(see the <b>Tk_GetBitmap</b> manual entry for details). This
bitmap is passed to the window manager to be used as a mask
in conjunction with the <b>iconbitmap</b> option: where the
mask has zeroes no icon will be displayed; where it has
ones, the bits from the icon bitmap will be displayed. If an
empty string is specified for <i>bitmap</i> then any current
icon mask is cancelled for <i>window</i> (this is equivalent
to specifying a bitmap of all ones). If <i>bitmap</i> is
specified then the command returns an empty string.
Otherwise it returns the name of the current icon mask
associated with <i>window</i>, or an empty string if no mask
is in effect.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>wm iconname</b>
<i>window</i> ?<i>newName</i>?</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If <i>newName</i> is specified,
then it is passed to the window manager; the window manager
should display <i>newName</i> inside the icon associated
with <i>window</i>. In this case an empty string is returned
as result. If <i>newName</i> is not specified then the
command returns the current icon name for <i>window</i>, or
an empty string if no icon name has been specified (in this
case the window manager will normally display the
window&rsquo;s title, as specified with the <b>wm title</b>
command). <big>&#9474;</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>wm iconphoto</b>
<i>window</i> ?<b>&minus;default</b>? <i>image1</i>
?<i>image2 ...</i>? <big>&#9474;</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Sets the titlebar icon for
<i>window</i> based on the named photo <big>&#9474;</big>
images. If <b>&minus;default</b> is specified, this is
applied to all future <big>&#9474;</big> created toplevels
as well. The data in the images is taken as a
<big>&#9474;</big> snapshot at the time of invocation. If
the images are later <big>&#9474;</big> changed, this is not
reflected to the titlebar icons. Multiple <big>&#9474;</big>
images are accepted to allow different images sizes (e.g.,
16x16 <big>&#9474;</big> and 32x32) to be provided. The
window manager may scale provided <big>&#9474;</big> icons
to an appropriate size. <big>&#9474;</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">On Windows, the
images are packed into a Windows icon structure.
<big>&#9474;</big> This will override an ico specified to
<b>wm iconbitmap</b>, and vice <big>&#9474;</big> versa.
<big>&#9474;</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">On X, the
images are arranged into the _NET_WM_ICON X property,
<big>&#9474;</big> which most modern window managers
support. A <b>wm iconbitmap</b> may <big>&#9474;</big> exist
simultaneously. It is recommended to use not more than 2
<big>&#9474;</big> icons, placing the larger icon first.
<big>&#9474;</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">On Macintosh,
this currently does nothing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>wm iconposition</b>
<i>window</i> ?<i>x y</i>?</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> are
specified, they are passed to the window manager as a hint
about where to position the icon for <i>window</i>. In this
case an empty string is returned. If <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>
are specified as empty strings then any existing icon
position hint is cancelled. If neither <i>x</i> nor <i>y</i>
is specified, then the command returns a Tcl list containing
two values, which are the current icon position hints (if no
hints are in effect then an empty string is returned).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>wm iconwindow</b>
<i>window</i> ?<i>pathName</i>?</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If <i>pathName</i> is
specified, it is the path name for a window to use as icon
for <i>window</i>: when <i>window</i> is iconified then
<i>pathName</i> will be mapped to serve as icon, and when
<i>window</i> is de-iconified then <i>pathName</i> will be
unmapped again. If <i>pathName</i> is specified as an empty
string then any existing icon window association for
<i>window</i> will be cancelled. If the <i>pathName</i>
argument is specified then an empty string is returned.
Otherwise the command returns the path name of the current
icon window for <i>window</i>, or an empty string if there
is no icon window currently specified for <i>window</i>.
Button press events are disabled for <i>window</i> as long
as it is an icon window; this is needed in order to allow
window managers to &ldquo;own&rdquo; those events. Note: not
all window managers support the notion of an icon
window.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>wm manage</b>
<i>widget</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The <i>widget</i> specified
will become a stand alone top-level window. The window will
be decorated with the window managers title bar, etc. Only
<i>frame</i>, <i>labelframe</i> and <i>toplevel</i> widgets
can be used with this command. Attempting to pass any other
widget type will raise an error. Attempting to manage a
<i>toplevel</i> widget is benign and achieves nothing. See
also <b>GEOMETRY MANAGEMENT</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>wm maxsize</b> <i>window</i>
?<i>width height</i>?</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If <i>width</i> and
<i>height</i> are specified, they give the maximum
permissible dimensions for <i>window</i>. For gridded
windows the dimensions are specified in grid units;
otherwise they are specified in pixel units. The window
manager will restrict the window&rsquo;s dimensions to be
less than or equal to <i>width</i> and <i>height</i>. If
<i>width</i> and <i>height</i> are specified, then the
command returns an empty string. Otherwise it returns a Tcl
list with two elements, which are the maximum width and
height currently in effect. The maximum size defaults to the
size of the screen. See the sections on geometry management
below for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>wm minsize</b> <i>window</i>
?<i>width height</i>?</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If <i>width</i> and
<i>height</i> are specified, they give the minimum
permissible dimensions for <i>window</i>. For gridded
windows the dimensions are specified in grid units;
otherwise they are specified in pixel units. The window
manager will restrict the window&rsquo;s dimensions to be
greater than or equal to <i>width</i> and <i>height</i>. If
<i>width</i> and <i>height</i> are specified, then the
command returns an empty string. Otherwise it returns a Tcl
list with two elements, which are the minimum width and
height currently in effect. The minimum size defaults to one
pixel in each dimension. See the sections on geometry
management below for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>wm overrideredirect</b>
<i>window</i> ?<i>boolean</i>?</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If <i>boolean</i> is specified,
it must have a proper boolean form and the override-redirect
flag for <i>window</i> is set to that value. If
<i>boolean</i> is not specified then <b>1</b> or <b>0</b> is
returned to indicate whether or not the override-redirect
flag is currently set for <i>window</i>. Setting the
override-redirect flag for a window causes it to be ignored
by the window manager; among other things, this means that
the window will not be reparented from the root window into
a decorative frame and the user will not be able to
manipulate the window using the normal window manager
mechanisms.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>wm positionfrom</b>
<i>window</i> ?<i>who</i>?</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If <i>who</i> is specified, it
must be either <b>program</b> or <b>user</b>, or an
abbreviation of one of these two. It indicates whether
<i>window</i>&rsquo;s current position was requested by the
program or by the user. Many window managers ignore
program-requested initial positions and ask the user to
manually position the window; if <b>user</b> is specified
then the window manager should position the window at the
given place without asking the user for assistance. If
<i>who</i> is specified as an empty string, then the current
position source is cancelled. If <i>who</i> is specified,
then the command returns an empty string. Otherwise it
returns <b>user</b> or <b>program</b> to indicate the source
of the window&rsquo;s current position, or an empty string
if no source has been specified yet. Most window managers
interpret &ldquo;no source&rdquo; as equivalent to
<b>program</b>. Tk will automatically set the position
source to <b>user</b> when a <b>wm geometry</b> command is
invoked, unless the source has been set explicitly to
<b>program</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>wm protocol</b>
<i>window</i> ?<i>name</i>? ?<i>command</i>?</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This command is used to manage
window manager protocols such as <b>WM_DELETE_WINDOW</b>.
<i>Name</i> is the name of an atom corresponding to a window
manager protocol, such as <b>WM_DELETE_WINDOW</b> or
<b>WM_SAVE_YOURSELF</b> or <b>WM_TAKE_FOCUS</b>. If both
<i>name</i> and <i>command</i> are specified, then
<i>command</i> is associated with the protocol specified by
<i>name</i>. <i>Name</i> will be added to
<i>window</i>&rsquo;s <b>WM_PROTOCOLS</b> property to tell
the window manager that the application has a protocol
handler for <i>name</i>, and <i>command</i> will be invoked
in the future whenever the window manager sends a message to
the client for that protocol. In this case the command
returns an empty string. If <i>name</i> is specified but
<i>command</i> is not, then the current command for
<i>name</i> is returned, or an empty string if there is no
handler defined for <i>name</i>. If <i>command</i> is
specified as an empty string then the current handler for
<i>name</i> is deleted and it is removed from the
<b>WM_PROTOCOLS</b> property on <i>window</i>; an empty
string is returned. Lastly, if neither <i>name</i> nor
<i>command</i> is specified, the command returns a list of
all the protocols for which handlers are currently defined
for <i>window</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Tk always
defines a protocol handler for <b>WM_DELETE_WINDOW</b>, even
if you have not asked for one with <b>wm protocol</b>. If a
<b>WM_DELETE_WINDOW</b> message arrives when you have not
defined a handler, then Tk handles the message by destroying
the window for which it was received.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>wm resizable</b>
<i>window</i> ?<i>width height</i>?</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This command controls whether
or not the user may interactively resize a top-level window.
If <i>width</i> and <i>height</i> are specified, they are
boolean values that determine whether the width and height
of <i>window</i> may be modified by the user. In this case
the command returns an empty string. If <i>width</i> and
<i>height</i> are omitted then the command returns a list
with two 0/1 elements that indicate whether the width and
height of <i>window</i> are currently resizable. By default,
windows are resizable in both dimensions. If resizing is
disabled, then the window&rsquo;s size will be the size from
the most recent interactive resize or <b>wm geometry</b>
command. If there has been no such operation then the
window&rsquo;s natural size will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>wm sizefrom</b>
<i>window</i> ?<i>who</i>?</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If <i>who</i> is specified, it
must be either <b>program</b> or <b>user</b>, or an
abbreviation of one of these two. It indicates whether
<i>window</i>&rsquo;s current size was requested by the
program or by the user. Some window managers ignore
program-requested sizes and ask the user to manually size
the window; if <b>user</b> is specified then the window
manager should give the window its specified size without
asking the user for assistance. If <i>who</i> is specified
as an empty string, then the current size source is
cancelled. If <i>who</i> is specified, then the command
returns an empty string. Otherwise it returns <b>user</b> or
<b>window</b> to indicate the source of the window&rsquo;s
current size, or an empty string if no source has been
specified yet. Most window managers interpret &ldquo;no
source&rdquo; as equivalent to <b>program</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>wm stackorder</b>
<i>window</i> ?<b>isabove</b>|<b>isbelow</b>
<i>window</i>?</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The <b>stackorder</b> command
returns a list of toplevel windows in stacking order, from
lowest to highest. When a single toplevel window is passed,
the returned list recursively includes all of the
window&rsquo;s children that are toplevels. Only those
toplevels that are currently mapped to the screen are
returned. The <b>stackorder</b> command can also be used to
determine if one toplevel is positioned above or below a
second toplevel. When two window arguments separated by
either <b>isabove</b> or <b>isbelow</b> are passed, a
boolean result indicates whether or not the first window is
currently above or below the second window in the stacking
order.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>wm state</b> <i>window</i>
?newstate?</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If <i>newstate</i> is
specified, the window will be set to the new state,
otherwise it returns the current state of <i>window</i>:
either <b>normal</b>, <b>iconic</b>, <b>withdrawn</b>,
<b>icon</b>, or (Windows and Mac OS X only) <b>zoomed</b>.
The difference between <b>iconic</b> and <b>icon</b> is that
<b>iconic</b> refers to a window that has been iconified
(e.g., with the <b>wm iconify</b> command) while <b>icon</b>
refers to a window whose only purpose is to serve as the
icon for some other window (via the <b>wm iconwindow</b>
command). The <b>icon</b> state cannot be set.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>wm title</b> <i>window</i>
?<i>string</i>?</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If <i>string</i> is specified,
then it will be passed to the window manager for use as the
title for <i>window</i> (the window manager should display
this string in <i>window</i>&rsquo;s title bar). In this
case the command returns an empty string. If <i>string</i>
is not specified then the command returns the current title
for the <i>window</i>. The title for a window defaults to
its name.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>wm transient</b>
<i>window</i> ?<i>master</i>?</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If <i>master</i> is specified,
then the window manager is informed that <i>window</i> is a
transient window (e.g. pull-down menu) working on behalf of
<i>master</i> (where <i>master</i> is the path name for a
top-level window). If <i>master</i> is specified as an empty
string then <i>window</i> is marked as not being a transient
window any more. Otherwise the command returns the path name
of <i>window</i>&rsquo;s current master, or an empty string
if <i>window</i> is not currently a transient window. A
transient window will mirror state changes in the master and
inherit the state of the master when initially mapped. It is
an error to attempt to make a window a transient of
itself.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>wm withdraw</b>
<i>window</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Arranges for <i>window</i> to
be withdrawn from the screen. This causes the window to be
unmapped and forgotten about by the window manager. If the
window has never been mapped, then this command causes the
window to be mapped in the withdrawn state. Not all window
managers appear to know how to handle windows that are
mapped in the withdrawn state. Note: it sometimes seems to
be necessary to withdraw a window and then re-map it (e.g.
with <b>wm deiconify</b>) to get some window managers to pay
attention to changes in window attributes such as group.</p>

<h2>GEOMETRY MANAGEMENT
<a name="GEOMETRY MANAGEMENT"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">By default a
top-level window appears on the screen in its <i>natural
size</i>, which is the one determined internally by its
widgets and geometry managers. If the natural size of a
top-level window changes, then the window&rsquo;s size
changes to match. A top-level window can be given a size
other than its natural size in two ways. First, the user can
resize the window manually using the facilities of the
window manager, such as resize handles. Second, the
application can request a particular size for a top-level
window using the <b>wm geometry</b> command. These two cases
are handled identically by Tk; in either case, the requested
size overrides the natural size. You can return the window
to its natural by invoking <b>wm geometry</b> with an empty
<i>geometry</i> string.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Normally a
top-level window can have any size from one pixel in each
dimension up to the size of its screen. However, you can use
the <b>wm minsize</b> and <b>wm maxsize</b> commands to
limit the range of allowable sizes. The range set by <b>wm
minsize</b> and <b>wm maxsize</b> applies to all forms of
resizing, including the window&rsquo;s natural size as well
as manual resizes and the <b>wm geometry</b> command. You
can also use the command <b>wm resizable</b> to completely
disable interactive resizing in one or both dimensions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The <b>wm
manage</b> and <b>wm forget</b> commands may be used to
perform undocking and docking of windows. After a widget is
managed by <b>wm manage</b> command, all other <b>wm</b>
subcommands may be used with the widget. Only widgets
created using the toplevel command may have an attached menu
via the <b>&minus;menu</b> configure option. A toplevel
widget may be used as a frame and managed with any of the
other geometry managers after using the <b>wm forget</b>
command. Any menu associated with a toplevel widget will be
hidden when managed by another geometry managers. The menus
will reappear once the window is managed by <b>wm</b>. All
custom bindtags for widgets in a subtree that have their
top-level widget changed via a <b>wm manage</b> or <b>wm
forget</b> command, must be redone to adjust any top-level
widget path in the bindtags. Bindtags that have not been
customized do not have to be redone.</p>

<h2>GRIDDED GEOMETRY MANAGEMENT
<a name="GRIDDED GEOMETRY MANAGEMENT"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Gridded
geometry management occurs when one of the widgets of an
application supports a range of useful sizes. This occurs,
for example, in a text editor where the scrollbars, menus,
and other adornments are fixed in size but the edit widget
can support any number of lines of text or characters per
line. In this case, it is usually desirable to let the user
specify the number of lines or characters-per-line, either
with the <b>wm geometry</b> command or by interactively
resizing the window. In the case of text, and in other
interesting cases also, only discrete sizes of the window
make sense, such as integral numbers of lines and
characters-per-line; arbitrary pixel sizes are not
useful.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Gridded
geometry management provides support for this kind of
application. Tk (and the window manager) assume that there
is a grid of some sort within the application and that the
application should be resized in terms of <i>grid units</i>
rather than pixels. Gridded geometry management is typically
invoked by turning on the <b>setGrid</b> option for a
widget; it can also be invoked with the <b>wm grid</b>
command or by calling <b>Tk_SetGrid</b>. In each of these
approaches the particular widget (or sometimes code in the
application as a whole) specifies the relationship between
integral grid sizes for the window and pixel sizes. To
return to non-gridded geometry management, invoke <b>wm
grid</b> with empty argument strings.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When gridded
geometry management is enabled then all the dimensions
specified in <b>wm minsize</b>, <b>wm maxsize</b>, and <b>wm
geometry</b> commands are treated as grid units rather than
pixel units. Interactive resizing is also carried out in
even numbers of grid units rather than pixels.</p>

<h2>BUGS
<a name="BUGS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Most existing
window managers appear to have bugs that affect the
operation of the <b>wm</b> command. For example, some
changes will not take effect if the window is already
active: the window will have to be withdrawn and
de-iconified in order to make the change happen.</p>

<h2>EXAMPLES
<a name="EXAMPLES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A fixed-size
window that says that it is fixed-size too:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">toplevel .fixed <b><br>

wm resizable</b> .fixed 0 0</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A simple
