&minus; Perl Unicode Tutorial</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The days of
just flinging strings around are over. It&rsquo;s well
established that modern programs need to be capable of
communicating funny accented letters, and things like euro
symbols. This means that programmers need new habits.
It&rsquo;s easy to program Unicode capable software, but it
does require discipline to do it right.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There&rsquo;s a
lot to know about character sets, and text encodings.
It&rsquo;s probably best to spend a full day learning all
this, but the basics can be learned in minutes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These are not
the very basics, though. It is assumed that you already know
the difference between bytes and characters, and realise
(and accept!) that there are many different character sets
and encodings, and that your program has to be explicit
about them. Recommended reading is &quot;The Absolute
Minimum Every Software Developer Absolutely, Positively Must
Know About Unicode and Character Sets (No Excuses!)&quot; by
Joel Spolsky, at
&lt;http://joelonsoftware.com/articles/Unicode.html&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This tutorial
speaks in rather absolute terms, and provides only a limited
view of the wealth of character string related features that
Perl has to offer. For most projects, this information will
probably suffice.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Definitions</b>
<br>
It&rsquo;s important to set a few things straight first.
This is the most important part of this tutorial. This view
may conflict with other information that you may have found
on the web, but that&rsquo;s mostly because many sources are
wrong.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You may have to
re-read this entire section a few times...</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Unicode</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Unicode</b>
is a character set with room for lots of characters. The
ordinal value of a character is called a <b>code point</b>.
(But in practice, the distinction between code point and
character is blurred, so the terms often are used
interchangeably.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There are many,
many code points, but computers work with bytes, and a byte
has room for only 256 values. Unicode has many more
characters than that, so you need a method to make these
accessible.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Unicode is
encoded using several competing encodings, of which
<small>UTF&minus;8</small> is the most used. In a Unicode
encoding, multiple subsequent bytes can be used to store a
single code point, or simply: character.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i><small>UTF&minus;8</small></i></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><small><b>UTF&minus;8</b></small>
is a Unicode encoding. Many people think that Unicode and
<small>UTF&minus;8</small> are the same thing, but
they&rsquo;re not. There are more Unicode encodings, but
much of the world has standardized on
<small>UTF&minus;8</small> .</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><small>UTF&minus;8</small>
treats the first 128 codepoints, 0..127, the same as
<small>ASCII</small> . They take only one byte per
character. All other characters are encoded as two or more
(up to six) bytes using a complex scheme. Fortunately, Perl
handles this for us, so we don&rsquo;t have to worry about
this.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Text strings
(character strings)</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Text
strings</b>, or <b>character strings</b> are made of
characters. Bytes are irrelevant here, and so are encodings.
Each character is just that: the character.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On a text
string, you would do things like:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    $text =~ s/foo/bar/;
    if ($string =~ /^\d+$/) { ... }
    $text = ucfirst $text;
    my $character_count = length $text;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The value of a
character (<tt>&quot;ord&quot;</tt>,
<tt>&quot;chr&quot;</tt>) is the corresponding Unicode code
point.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Binary
strings (byte strings)</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Binary
strings</b>, or <b>byte strings</b> are made of bytes. Here,
you don&rsquo;t have characters, just bytes. All
communication with the outside world (anything outside of
your current Perl process) is done in binary.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On a binary
string, you would do things like:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    my (@length_content) = unpack &quot;(V/a)*&quot;, $binary;
    $binary =~ s/\x00\x0F/\xFF\xF0/;  # for the brave :)
    print {$fh} $binary;
    my $byte_count = length $binary;</pre>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Encoding</i></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Encoding</b>
(as a verb) is the conversion from <i>text</i> to
<i>binary</i>. To encode, you have to supply the target
encoding, for example
<tt>&quot;iso&minus;8859&minus;1&quot;</tt> or
<tt>&quot;UTF&minus;8&quot;</tt>. Some encodings, like the
<tt>&quot;iso&minus;8859&quot;</tt> (&quot;latin&quot;)
range, do not support the full Unicode standard; characters
that can&rsquo;t be represented are lost in the
conversion.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Decoding</i></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Decoding</b>
is the conversion from <i>binary</i> to <i>text</i>. To
decode, you have to know what encoding was used during the
encoding phase. And most of all, it must be something
decodable. It doesn&rsquo;t make much sense to decode a
<small>PNG</small> image into a text string.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Internal
format</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Perl has an
<b>internal format</b>, an encoding that it uses to encode
text strings so it can store them in memory. All text
strings are in this internal format. In fact, text strings
are never in any other format!</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You
shouldn&rsquo;t worry about what this format is, because
conversion is automatically done when you decode or
encode.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Your new
toolkit</b> <br>
Add to your standard heading the following line:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    use Encode qw(encode decode);</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Or, if
you&rsquo;re lazy, just:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    use Encode;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>I/O flow
(the actual 5 minute tutorial)</b> <br>
The typical input/output flow of a program is:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    1. Receive and decode
    2. Process
    3. Encode and output</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If your input
is binary, and is supposed to remain binary, you
shouldn&rsquo;t decode it to a text string, of course. But
in all other cases, you should decode it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Decoding
can&rsquo;t happen reliably if you don&rsquo;t know how the
data was encoded. If you get to choose, it&rsquo;s a good
idea to standardize on <small>UTF&minus;8</small> .</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    my $foo   = decode('UTF&minus;8', get 'http://example.com/');
    my $bar   = decode('ISO&minus;8859&minus;1', readline STDIN);
    my $xyzzy = decode('Windows&minus;1251', $cgi&minus;&gt;param('foo'));</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Processing
happens as you knew before. The only difference is that
you&rsquo;re now using characters instead of bytes.
That&rsquo;s very useful if you use things like
<tt>&quot;substr&quot;</tt>, or
<tt>&quot;length&quot;</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It&rsquo;s
important to realize that there are no bytes in a text
string. Of course, Perl has its internal encoding to store
the string in memory, but ignore that. If you have to do
anything with the number of bytes, it&rsquo;s probably best
to move that part to step 3, just after you&rsquo;ve encoded
the string. Then you know exactly how many bytes it will be
in the destination string.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The syntax for
encoding text strings to binary strings is as simple as
decoding:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    $body = encode('UTF&minus;8', $body);</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you needed
to know the length of the string in bytes, now&rsquo;s the
perfect time for that. Because <tt>$body</tt> is now a byte
string, <tt>&quot;length&quot;</tt> will report the number
of bytes, instead of the number of characters. The number of
characters is no longer known, because characters only exist
in text strings.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    my $byte_count = length $body;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">And if the
protocol you&rsquo;re using supports a way of letting the
recipient know which character encoding you used, please
help the receiving end by using that feature! For example,
E&minus;mail and <small>HTTP</small> support
<small>MIME</small> headers, so you can use the
<tt>&quot;Content&minus;Type&quot;</tt> header. They can
also have <tt>&quot;Content&minus;Length&quot;</tt> to
indicate the number of <i>bytes</i>, which is always a good
idea to supply if the number is known.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    &quot;Content&minus;Type: text/plain; charset=UTF&minus;8&quot;,
    &quot;Content&minus;Length: $byte_count&quot;</pre>

<h2>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
<a name="ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Thanks to Johan
Vromans from Squirrel Consultancy. His
<small>UTF&minus;8</small> rants during the Amsterdam Perl
Mongers meetings got me interested and determined to find
out how to use character encodings in Perl in ways that
don&rsquo;t break easily.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Thanks to
Gerard Goossen from <small>TTY</small> . His presentation
&quot; <small>UTF&minus;8</small> in the wild&quot; (Dutch
Perl Workshop 2006) inspired me to publish my thoughts and
write this tutorial.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Thanks to the
people who asked about this kind of stuff in several Perl
<small>IRC</small> channels, and have constantly reminded me
that a simpler explanation was needed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Thanks to the
people who reviewed this document for me, before it went
public. They are: Benjamin Smith, Jan-Pieter Cornet, Johan
Vromans, Lukas Mai, Nathan Gray.</p>
