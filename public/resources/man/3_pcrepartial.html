<h2>PARTIAL MATCHING IN PCRE
<a name="PARTIAL MATCHING IN PCRE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In normal use
of PCRE, if the subject string that is passed to a matching
function matches as far as it goes, but is too short to
match the entire pattern, PCRE_ERROR_NOMATCH is returned.
There are circumstances where it might be helpful to
distinguish this case from other cases in which there is no
match.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Consider, for
example, an application where a human is required to type in
data for a field with specific formatting requirements. An
example might be a date in the form <i>ddmmmyy</i>, defined
by this pattern:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">^\d?\d(jan|feb|mar|apr|may|jun|jul|aug|sep|oct|nov|dec)\d\d$</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the
application sees the user&rsquo;s keystrokes one by one, and
can check that what has been typed so far is potentially
valid, it is able to raise an error as soon as a mistake is
made, by beeping and not reflecting the character that has
been typed, for example. This immediate feedback is likely
to be a better user interface than a check that is delayed
until the entire string has been entered. Partial matching
can also be useful when the subject string is very long and
is not all available at once.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">PCRE supports
partial matching by means of the PCRE_PARTIAL_SOFT and
PCRE_PARTIAL_HARD options, which can be set when calling any
of the matching functions. For backwards compatibility,
PCRE_PARTIAL is a synonym for PCRE_PARTIAL_SOFT. The
essential difference between the two options is whether or
not a partial match is preferred to an alternative complete
match, though the details differ between the two types of
matching function. If both options are set,
PCRE_PARTIAL_HARD takes precedence.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you want to
use partial matching with just-in-time optimized code, you
must call <b>pcre_study()</b>, <b>pcre16_study()</b> or
<b>pcre32_study()</b> with one or both of these options:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">PCRE_STUDY_JIT_PARTIAL_SOFT_COMPILE
<br>
PCRE_STUDY_JIT_PARTIAL_HARD_COMPILE</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">PCRE_STUDY_JIT_COMPILE
should also be set if you are going to run non-partial
matches on the same pattern. If the appropriate JIT study
mode has not been set for a match, the interpretive matching
code is used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Setting a
partial matching option disables two of PCRE&rsquo;s
standard optimizations. PCRE remembers the last literal data
unit in a pattern, and abandons matching immediately if it
is not present in the subject string. This optimization
cannot be used for a subject string that might match only
partially. If the pattern was studied, PCRE knows the
minimum length of a matching string, and does not bother to
run the matching function on shorter strings. This
optimization is also disabled for partial matching.</p>

<h2>PARTIAL MATCHING USING pcre_exec() OR pcre[16|32]_exec()
<a name="PARTIAL MATCHING USING pcre_exec() OR pcre[16|32]_exec()"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A partial match
occurs during a call to <b>pcre_exec()</b> or
<b>pcre[16|32]_exec()</b> when the end of the subject string
is reached successfully, but matching cannot continue
because more characters are needed. However, at least one
character in the subject must have been inspected. This
character need not form part of the final matched string;
lookbehind assertions and the \K escape sequence provide
ways of inspecting characters before the start of a matched
substring. The requirement for inspecting at least one
character exists because an empty string can always be
matched; without such a restriction there would always be a
partial match of an empty string at the end of the
subject.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If there are at
least two slots in the offsets vector when a partial match
is returned, the first slot is set to the offset of the
earliest character that was inspected. For convenience, the
second offset points to the end of the subject so that a
substring can easily be identified.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For the
majority of patterns, the first offset identifies the start
of the partially matched string. However, for patterns that
contain lookbehind assertions, or \K, or begin with \b or
\B, earlier characters have been inspected while carrying
out the match. For example:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">/(?&lt;=abc)123/</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This pattern
matches &quot;123&quot;, but only if it is preceded by
&quot;abc&quot;. If the subject string is
&quot;xyzabc12&quot;, the offsets after a partial match are
for the substring &quot;abc12&quot;, because all these
characters are needed if another match is tried with extra
characters added to the subject.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">What happens
when a partial match is identified depends on which of the
two partial matching options are set.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>PCRE_PARTIAL_SOFT
WITH pcre_exec() OR pcre[16|32]_exec()</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If
PCRE_PARTIAL_SOFT is set when <b>pcre_exec()</b> or
<b>pcre[16|32]_exec()</b> identifies a partial match, the
partial match is remembered, but matching continues as
normal, and other alternatives in the pattern are tried. If
no complete match can be found, PCRE_ERROR_PARTIAL is
returned instead of PCRE_ERROR_NOMATCH.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This option is
&quot;soft&quot; because it prefers a complete match over a
partial match. All the various matching items in a pattern
behave as if the subject string is potentially complete. For
example, \z, \Z, and $ match at the end of the subject, as
normal, and for \b and \B the end of the subject is treated
as a non-alphanumeric.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If there is
more than one partial match, the first one that was found
provides the data that is returned. Consider this
pattern:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">/123\w+X|dogY/</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If this is
matched against the subject string &quot;abc123dog&quot;,
both alternatives fail to match, but the end of the subject
is reached during matching, so PCRE_ERROR_PARTIAL is
returned. The offsets are set to 3 and 9, identifying
&quot;123dog&quot; as the first partial match that was
found. (In this example, there are two partial matches,
because &quot;dog&quot; on its own partially matches the
second alternative.)</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>PCRE_PARTIAL_HARD
WITH pcre_exec() OR pcre[16|32]_exec()</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If
PCRE_PARTIAL_HARD is set for <b>pcre_exec()</b> or
<b>pcre[16|32]_exec()</b>, PCRE_ERROR_PARTIAL is returned as
soon as a partial match is found, without continuing to
search for possible complete matches. This option is
&quot;hard&quot; because it prefers an earlier partial match
over a later complete match. For this reason, the assumption
is made that the end of the supplied subject string may not
be the true end of the available data, and so, if \z, \Z,
\b, \B, or $ are encountered at the end of the subject, the
result is PCRE_ERROR_PARTIAL, provided that at least one
character in the subject has been inspected.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Setting
PCRE_PARTIAL_HARD also affects the way UTF-8 and UTF-16
subject strings are checked for validity. Normally, an
invalid sequence causes the error PCRE_ERROR_BADUTF8 or
PCRE_ERROR_BADUTF16. However, in the special case of a
truncated character at the end of the subject,
PCRE_ERROR_SHORTUTF8 or PCRE_ERROR_SHORTUTF16 is returned
when PCRE_PARTIAL_HARD is set.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Comparing
hard and soft partial matching</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The difference
between the two partial matching options can be illustrated
by a pattern such as:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">/dog(sbody)?/</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This matches
either &quot;dog&quot; or &quot;dogsbody&quot;, greedily
(that is, it prefers the longer string if possible). If it
is matched against the string &quot;dog&quot; with
PCRE_PARTIAL_SOFT, it yields a complete match for
&quot;dog&quot;. However, if PCRE_PARTIAL_HARD is set, the
result is PCRE_ERROR_PARTIAL. On the other hand, if the
pattern is made ungreedy the result is different:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">/dog(sbody)??/</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In this case
the result is always a complete match because that is found
first, and matching never continues after finding a complete
match. It might be easier to follow this explanation by
thinking of the two patterns like this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">/dog(sbody)?/
is the same as /dogsbody|dog/ <br>
/dog(sbody)??/ is the same as /dog|dogsbody/</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The second
pattern will never match &quot;dogsbody&quot;, because it
will always find the shorter match first.</p>

<h2>PARTIAL MATCHING USING pcre_dfa_exec() OR pcre[16|32]_dfa_exec()
<a name="PARTIAL MATCHING USING pcre_dfa_exec() OR pcre[16|32]_dfa_exec()"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The DFA
functions move along the subject string character by
character, without backtracking, searching for all possible
matches simultaneously. If the end of the subject is reached
before the end of the pattern, there is the possibility of a
partial match, again provided that at least one character
has been inspected.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When
PCRE_PARTIAL_SOFT is set, PCRE_ERROR_PARTIAL is returned
only if there have been no complete matches. Otherwise, the
complete matches are returned. However, if PCRE_PARTIAL_HARD
is set, a partial match takes precedence over any complete
matches. The portion of the string that was inspected when
the longest partial match was found is set as the first
matching string, provided there are at least two slots in
the offsets vector.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Because the DFA
functions always search for all possible matches, and there
is no difference between greedy and ungreedy repetition,
their behaviour is different from the standard functions
when PCRE_PARTIAL_HARD is set. Consider the string
&quot;dog&quot; matched against the ungreedy pattern shown
above:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">/dog(sbody)??/</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Whereas the
standard functions stop as soon as they find the complete
match for &quot;dog&quot;, the DFA functions also find the
partial match for &quot;dogsbody&quot;, and so return that
when PCRE_PARTIAL_HARD is set.</p>

<h2>PARTIAL MATCHING AND WORD BOUNDARIES
<a name="PARTIAL MATCHING AND WORD BOUNDARIES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If a pattern
ends with one of sequences \b or \B, which test for word
boundaries, partial matching with PCRE_PARTIAL_SOFT can give
counter-intuitive results. Consider this pattern:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">/\bcat\b/</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This matches
&quot;cat&quot;, provided there is a word boundary at either
end. If the subject string is &quot;the cat&quot;, the
comparison of the final &quot;t&quot; with a following
character cannot take place, so a partial match is found.
However, normal matching carries on, and \b matches at the
end of the subject when the last character is a letter, so a
complete match is found. The result, therefore, is
<i>not</i> PCRE_ERROR_PARTIAL. Using PCRE_PARTIAL_HARD in
this case does yield PCRE_ERROR_PARTIAL, because then the
partial match takes precedence.</p>

<h2>FORMERLY RESTRICTED PATTERNS
<a name="FORMERLY RESTRICTED PATTERNS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For releases of
PCRE prior to 8.00, because of the way certain internal
optimizations were implemented in the <b>pcre_exec()</b>
function, the PCRE_PARTIAL option (predecessor of
PCRE_PARTIAL_SOFT) could not be used with all patterns. From
release 8.00 onwards, the restrictions no longer apply, and
partial matching with can be requested for any pattern.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Items that were
formerly restricted were repeated single characters and
repeated metasequences. If PCRE_PARTIAL was set for a
pattern that did not conform to the restrictions,
<b>pcre_exec()</b> returned the error code
PCRE_ERROR_BADPARTIAL (-13). This error code is no longer in
use. The PCRE_INFO_OKPARTIAL call to <b>pcre_fullinfo()</b>
to find out if a compiled pattern can be used for partial
matching now always returns 1.</p>

<h2>EXAMPLE OF PARTIAL MATCHING USING PCRETEST
<a name="EXAMPLE OF PARTIAL MATCHING USING PCRETEST"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the escape
sequence \P is present in a <b>pcretest</b> data line, the
PCRE_PARTIAL_SOFT option is used for the match. Here is a
run of <b>pcretest</b> that uses the date example quoted
above:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">re&gt;
/^\d?\d(jan|feb|mar|apr|may|jun|jul|aug|sep|oct|nov|dec)\d\d$/
<br>
data&gt; 25jun04\P <br>
0: 25jun04 <br>
1: jun <br>
data&gt; 25dec3\P <br>
Partial match: 23dec3 <br>
data&gt; 3ju\P <br>
Partial match: 3ju <br>
data&gt; 3juj\P <br>
No match <br>
data&gt; j\P <br>
No match</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The first data
string is matched completely, so <b>pcretest</b> shows the
matched substrings. The remaining four strings do not match
the complete pattern, but the first two are partial matches.
Similar output is obtained if DFA matching is used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the escape
sequence \P is present more than once in a <b>pcretest</b>
data line, the PCRE_PARTIAL_HARD option is set for the
match.</p>

<h2>MULTI-SEGMENT MATCHING WITH pcre_dfa_exec() OR pcre[16|32]_dfa_exec()
<a name="MULTI-SEGMENT MATCHING WITH pcre_dfa_exec() OR pcre[16|32]_dfa_exec()"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When a partial
match has been found using a DFA matching function, it is
possible to continue the match by providing additional
subject data and calling the function again with the same
compiled regular expression, this time setting the
PCRE_DFA_RESTART option. You must pass the same working
space as before, because this is where details of the
previous partial match are stored. Here is an example using
<b>pcretest</b>, using the \R escape sequence to set the
PCRE_DFA_RESTART option (\D specifies the use of the DFA
matching function):</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">re&gt;
/^\d?\d(jan|feb|mar|apr|may|jun|jul|aug|sep|oct|nov|dec)\d\d$/
<br>
data&gt; 23ja\P\D <br>
Partial match: 23ja <br>
data&gt; n05\R\D <br>
0: n05</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The first call
has &quot;23ja&quot; as the subject, and requests partial
matching; the second call has &quot;n05&quot; as the subject
for the continued (restarted) match. Notice that when the
match is complete, only the last part is shown; PCRE does
not retain the previously partially-matched string. It is up
to the calling program to do that if it needs to.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can set the
PCRE_PARTIAL_SOFT or PCRE_PARTIAL_HARD options with
PCRE_DFA_RESTART to continue partial matching over multiple
segments. This facility can be used to pass very long
subject strings to the DFA matching functions.</p>

<h2>MULTI-SEGMENT MATCHING WITH pcre_exec() OR pcre[16|32]_exec()
<a name="MULTI-SEGMENT MATCHING WITH pcre_exec() OR pcre[16|32]_exec()"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">From release
8.00, the standard matching functions can also be used to do
multi-segment matching. Unlike the DFA functions, it is not
possible to restart the previous match with a new segment of
data. Instead, new data must be added to the previous
subject string, and the entire match re-run, starting from
the point where the partial match occurred. Earlier data can
be discarded.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is best to
use PCRE_PARTIAL_HARD in this situation, because it does not
treat the end of a segment as the end of the subject when
matching \z, \Z, \b, \B, and $. Consider an unanchored
pattern that matches dates:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">re&gt;
/\d?\d(jan|feb|mar|apr|may|jun|jul|aug|sep|oct|nov|dec)\d\d/
<br>
data&gt; The date is 23ja\P\P <br>
Partial match: 23ja</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">At this stage,
an application could discard the text preceding
&quot;23ja&quot;, add on text from the next segment, and
call the matching function again. Unlike the DFA matching
functions, the entire matching string must always be
available, and the complete matching process occurs for each
call, so more memory and more processing time is needed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Note:</b> If
the pattern contains lookbehind assertions, or \K, or starts
with \b or \B, the string that is returned for a partial
match includes characters that precede the partially matched
string itself, because these must be retained when adding on
more characters for a subsequent matching attempt. However,
in some cases you may need to retain even earlier
characters, as discussed in the next section.</p>

<h2>ISSUES WITH MULTI-SEGMENT MATCHING
<a name="ISSUES WITH MULTI-SEGMENT MATCHING"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Certain types
of pattern may give problems with multi-segment matching,
whichever matching function is used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">1. If the
pattern contains a test for the beginning of a line, you
need to pass the PCRE_NOTBOL option when the subject string
for any call does start at the beginning of a line. There is
also a PCRE_NOTEOL option, but in practice when doing
multi-segment matching you should be using
PCRE_PARTIAL_HARD, which includes the effect of
PCRE_NOTEOL.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">2. Lookbehind
assertions that have already been obeyed are catered for in
the offsets that are returned for a partial match. However a
lookbehind assertion later in the pattern could require even
earlier characters to be inspected. You can handle this case
by using the PCRE_INFO_MAXLOOKBEHIND option of the
<b>pcre_fullinfo()</b> or <b>pcre[16|32]_fullinfo()</b>
functions to obtain the length of the largest lookbehind in
the pattern. This length is given in characters, not bytes.
If you always retain at least that many characters before
the partially matched string, all should be well. (Of
course, near the start of the subject, fewer characters may
be present; in that case all characters should be
retained.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">3. Because a
partial match must always contain at least one character,
what might be considered a partial match of an empty string
actually gives a &quot;no match&quot; result. For
example:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">re&gt;
/c(?&lt;=abc)x/ <br>
data&gt; ab\P <br>
No match</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the next
segment begins &quot;cx&quot;, a match should be found, but
this will only happen if characters from the previous
segment are retained. For this reason, a &quot;no
match&quot; result should be interpreted as &quot;partial
match of an empty string&quot; when the pattern contains
lookbehinds.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">4. Matching a
subject string that is split into multiple segments may not
always produce exactly the same result as matching over one
single long string, especially when PCRE_PARTIAL_SOFT is
used. The section &quot;Partial Matching and Word
Boundaries&quot; above describes an issue that arises if the
pattern ends with \b or \B. Another kind of difference may
occur when there are multiple matching possibilities,
because (for PCRE_PARTIAL_SOFT) a partial match result is
given only when there are no completed matches. This means
that as soon as the shortest match has been found,
continuation to a new subject segment is no longer possible.
Consider again this <b>pcretest</b> example:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">re&gt;
/dog(sbody)?/ <br>
data&gt; dogsb\P <br>
0: dog <br>
data&gt; do\P\D <br>
Partial match: do <br>
data&gt; gsb\R\P\D <br>
0: g <br>
data&gt; dogsbody\D <br>
0: dogsbody <br>
1: dog</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The first data
line passes the string &quot;dogsb&quot; to a standard
matching function, setting the PCRE_PARTIAL_SOFT option.
Although the string is a partial match for
&quot;dogsbody&quot;, the result is not PCRE_ERROR_PARTIAL,
because the shorter string &quot;dog&quot; is a complete
match. Similarly, when the subject is presented to a DFA
matching function in several parts (&quot;do&quot; and
&quot;gsb&quot; being the first two) the match stops when
&quot;dog&quot; has been found, and it is not possible to
continue. On the other hand, if &quot;dogsbody&quot; is
presented as a single string, a DFA matching function finds
both matches.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Because of
these problems, it is best to use PCRE_PARTIAL_HARD when
matching multi-segment data. The example above then behaves
differently:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">re&gt;
/dog(sbody)?/ <br>
data&gt; dogsb\P\P <br>
Partial match: dogsb <br>
data&gt; do\P\D <br>
Partial match: do <br>
data&gt; gsb\R\P\P\D <br>
Partial match: gsb</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">5. Patterns
that contain alternatives at the top level which do not all
start with the same pattern item may not work as expected
when PCRE_DFA_RESTART is used. For example, consider this
pattern:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">1234|3789</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the first
part of the subject is &quot;ABC123&quot;, a partial match
of the first alternative is found at offset 3. There is no
partial match for the second alternative, because such a
match does not start at the same point in the subject
string. Attempting to continue with the string
&quot;7890&quot; does not yield a match because only those
alternatives that match at one point in the subject are
remembered. The problem arises because the start of the
second alternative matches within the first alternative.
There is no problem with anchored patterns or patterns such
as:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">1234|ABCD</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">where no string
can be a partial match for both alternatives. This is not a
problem if a standard matching function is used, because the
entire match has to be rerun each time:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">re&gt;
/1234|3789/ <br>
data&gt; ABC123\P\P <br>
Partial match: 123 <br>
data&gt; 1237890 <br>
0: 3789</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Of course,
instead of using PCRE_DFA_RESTART, the same technique of
re-running the entire match can also be used with the DFA
matching functions. Another possibility is to work with two
buffers. If a partial match at offset <i>n</i> in the first
buffer is followed by &quot;no match&quot; when
PCRE_DFA_RESTART is used on the second buffer, you can then
try a new match starting at offset <i>n+1</i> in the first
buffer.</p>
