<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Tcl_CreateInterp</b>
creates a new interpreter structure and returns a token for
it. The token is required in calls to most other Tcl
procedures, such as <b>Tcl_CreateCommand</b>,
<b>Tcl_Eval</b>, and <b>Tcl_DeleteInterp</b>. Clients are
only allowed to access a few of the fields of Tcl_Interp
structures; see the <b>Tcl_Interp</b> and
<b>Tcl_CreateCommand</b> man pages for details. The new
interpreter is initialized with the built-in Tcl commands
and with the variables documented in tclvars(n). To bind in
additional commands, call <b>Tcl_CreateCommand</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Tcl_DeleteInterp</b>
marks an interpreter as deleted; the interpreter will
eventually be deleted when all calls to <b>Tcl_Preserve</b>
for it have been matched by calls to <b>Tcl_Release</b>. At
that time, all of the resources associated with it,
including variables, procedures, and application-specific
command bindings, will be deleted. After
<b>Tcl_DeleteInterp</b> returns any attempt to use
<b>Tcl_Eval</b> on the interpreter will fail and return
<b>TCL_ERROR</b>. After the call to <b>Tcl_DeleteInterp</b>
it is safe to examine the interpreter&rsquo;s result, query
or set the values of variables, define, undefine or retrieve
procedures, and examine the runtime evaluation stack. See
below, in the section <b>INTERPRETERS AND MEMORY
MANAGEMENT</b> for details.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Tcl_InterpDeleted</b>
returns nonzero if <b>Tcl_DeleteInterp</b> was called with
<i>interp</i> as its argument; this indicates that the
interpreter will eventually be deleted, when the last call
to <b>Tcl_Preserve</b> for it is matched by a call to
<b>Tcl_Release</b>. If nonzero is returned, further calls to
<b>Tcl_Eval</b> in this interpreter will return
<b>TCL_ERROR</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Tcl_InterpDeleted</b>
is useful in deletion callbacks to distinguish between when
only the memory the callback is responsible for is being
deleted and when the whole interpreter is being deleted. In
the former case the callback may recreate the data being
deleted, but this would lead to an infinite loop if the
interpreter were being deleted.</p>

<h2>INTERPRETERS AND MEMORY MANAGEMENT
<a name="INTERPRETERS AND MEMORY MANAGEMENT"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Tcl_DeleteInterp</b>
can be called at any time on an interpreter that may be used
by nested evaluations and C code in various extensions. Tcl
implements a simple mechanism that allows callers to use
interpreters without worrying about the interpreter being
deleted in a nested call, and without requiring special code
to protect the interpreter, in most cases. This mechanism
ensures that nested uses of an interpreter can safely
continue using it even after <b>Tcl_DeleteInterp</b> is
called.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The mechanism
relies on matching up calls to <b>Tcl_Preserve</b> with
calls to <b>Tcl_Release</b>. If <b>Tcl_DeleteInterp</b> has
been called, only when the last call to <b>Tcl_Preserve</b>
is matched by a call to <b>Tcl_Release</b>, will the
interpreter be freed. See the manual entry for
<b>Tcl_Preserve</b> for a description of these
functions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The rules for
when the user of an interpreter must call
<b>Tcl_Preserve</b> and <b>Tcl_Release</b> are simple: <br>
Interpreters Passed As Arguments</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Functions that are passed an
interpreter as an argument can safely use the interpreter
without any special protection. Thus, when you write an
extension consisting of new Tcl commands, no special code is
needed to protect interpreters received as arguments. This
covers the majority of all uses.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Interpreter Creation And
Deletion</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">When a new interpreter is
created and used in a call to <b>Tcl_Eval</b>,
<b>Tcl_VarEval</b>, <b>Tcl_GlobalEval</b>,
<b>Tcl_SetVar</b>, or <b>Tcl_GetVar</b>, a pair of calls to
<b>Tcl_Preserve</b> and <b>Tcl_Release</b> should be wrapped
around all uses of the interpreter. Remember that it is
unsafe to use the interpreter once <b>Tcl_Release</b> has
been called. To ensure that the interpreter is properly
deleted when it is no longer needed, call
<b>Tcl_InterpDeleted</b> to test if some other code already
called <b>Tcl_DeleteInterp</b>; if not, call
<b>Tcl_DeleteInterp</b> before calling <b>Tcl_Release</b> in
your own code.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Retrieving An Interpreter From
A Data Structure</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">When an interpreter is
retrieved from a data structure (e.g. the client data of a
callback) for use in <b>Tcl_Eval</b>, <b>Tcl_VarEval</b>,
<b>Tcl_GlobalEval</b>, <b>Tcl_SetVar</b>, or
<b>Tcl_GetVar</b>, a pair of calls to <b>Tcl_Preserve</b>
and <b>Tcl_Release</b> should be wrapped around all uses of
the interpreter; it is unsafe to reuse the interpreter once
<b>Tcl_Release</b> has been called. If an interpreter is
stored inside a callback data structure, an appropriate
deletion cleanup mechanism should be set up by the code that
creates the data structure so that the interpreter is
removed from the data structure (e.g. by setting the field
to NULL) when the interpreter is deleted. Otherwise, you may
be using an interpreter that has been freed and whose memory
may already have been reused.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">All uses of
interpreters in Tcl and Tk have already been protected.
Extension writers should ensure that their code also
properly protects any additional interpreters used, as
described above.</p>
