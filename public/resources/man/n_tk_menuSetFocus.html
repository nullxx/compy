<h2>WIDGET-SPECIFIC OPTIONS
<a name="WIDGET-SPECIFIC OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">[<b>&minus;postcommand&nbsp;</b><i>postCommand</i>]
If this option is specified then it provides a Tcl command
to execute each time the menu is posted. The command is
invoked by the <b>post</b> widget command before posting the
menu. Note that in Tk 8.0 on Macintosh and Windows, all
post-commands in a system of menus are executed before any
of those menus are posted. This is due to the limitations in
the individual platforms&rsquo; menu managers.
[<b>&minus;selectcolor&nbsp;</b><i>selectColor</i>] For menu
entries that are check buttons or radio buttons, this option
specifies the color to display in the indicator when the
check button or radio button is selected.
[<b>&minus;tearoff&nbsp;</b><i>tearOff</i>] This option must
have a proper boolean value, which specifies whether or not
the menu should include a tear-off entry at the top. If so,
it will exist as entry 0 of the menu and the other entries
will number starting at 1. The default menu bindings arrange
for the menu to be torn off when the tear-off entry is
invoked.
[<b>&minus;tearoffcommand&nbsp;</b><i>tearOffCommand</i>] If
this option has a non-empty value, then it specifies a Tcl
command to invoke whenever the menu is torn off. The actual
command will consist of the value of this option, followed
by a space, followed by the name of the menu window,
followed by a space, followed by the name of the name of the
torn off menu window. For example, if the option&rsquo;s
value is &ldquo;<b>a b</b>&rdquo; and menu <b>.x.y</b> is
torn off to create a new menu <b>.x.tearoff1</b>, then the
command &ldquo;<b>a b .x.y .x.tearoff1</b>&rdquo; will be
invoked. [<b>&minus;title&nbsp;</b><i>title</i>] The string
will be used to title the window created when this menu is
torn off. If the title is NULL, then the window will have
the title of the menubutton or the text of the cascade item
from which this menu was invoked.
[<b>&minus;type&nbsp;</b><i>type</i>] This option can be one
of <b>menubar</b>, <b>tearoff</b>, or <b>normal</b>, and is
set when the menu is created. While the string returned by
the configuration database will change if this option is
changed, this does not affect the menu widget&rsquo;s
behavior. This is used by the cloning mechanism and is not
normally set outside of the Tk library.

<h2>INTRODUCTION
<a name="INTRODUCTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The <b>menu</b>
command creates a new top-level window (given by the
<i>pathName</i> argument) and makes it into a menu widget.
Additional options, described above, may be specified on the
command line or in the option database to configure aspects
of the menu such as its colors and font. The <b>menu</b>
command returns its <i>pathName</i> argument. At the time
this command is invoked, there must not exist a window named
<i>pathName</i>, but <i>pathName</i>&rsquo;s parent must
exist.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A menu is a
widget that displays a collection of one-line entries
arranged in one or more columns. There exist several
different types of entries, each with different properties.
Entries of different types may be combined in a single menu.
Menu entries are not the same as entry widgets. In fact,
menu entries are not even distinct widgets; the entire menu
is one widget.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Menu entries
are displayed with up to three separate fields. The main
field is a label in the form of a text string, a bitmap, or
an image, controlled by the <b>&minus;label</b>,
<b>&minus;bitmap</b>, and <b>&minus;image</b> options for
the entry. If the <b>&minus;accelerator</b> option is
specified for an entry then a second textual field is
displayed to the right of the label. The accelerator
typically describes a keystroke sequence that may be typed
in the application to cause the same result as invoking the
menu entry. The third field is an <i>indicator</i>. The
indicator is present only for checkbutton or radiobutton
entries. It indicates whether the entry is selected or not,
and is displayed to the left of the entry&rsquo;s
string.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In normal use,
an entry becomes active (displays itself differently)
whenever the mouse pointer is over the entry. If a mouse
button is released over the entry then the entry is
<i>invoked</i>. The effect of invocation is different for
each type of entry; these effects are described below in the
sections on individual entries.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Entries may be
<i>disabled</i>, which causes their labels and accelerators
to be displayed with dimmer colors. The default menu
bindings will not allow a disabled entry to be activated or
invoked. Disabled entries may be re-enabled, at which point
it becomes possible to activate and invoke them again.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Whenever a
menu&rsquo;s active entry is changed, a
&lt;&lt;MenuSelect&gt;&gt; virtual event is send to the
menu. The active item can then be queried from the menu, and
an action can be taken, such as setting context-sensitive
help text for the entry.</p>

<h2>TYPES OF ENTRIES
<a name="TYPES OF ENTRIES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>COMMAND
ENTRIES</b> <br>
The most common kind of menu entry is a command entry, which
behaves much like a button widget. When a command entry is
invoked, a Tcl command is executed. The Tcl command is
specified with the <b>&minus;command</b> option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>SEPARATOR
ENTRIES</b> <br>
A separator is an entry that is displayed as a horizontal
dividing line. A separator may not be activated or invoked,
and it has no behavior other than its display
appearance.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>CHECKBUTTON
ENTRIES</b> <br>
A checkbutton menu entry behaves much like a checkbutton
widget. When it is invoked it toggles back and forth between
the selected and deselected states. When the entry is
selected, a particular value is stored in a particular
global variable (as determined by the <b>&minus;onvalue</b>
and <b>&minus;variable</b> options for the entry); when the
entry is deselected another value (determined by the
<b>&minus;offvalue</b> option) is stored in the global
variable. An indicator box is displayed to the left of the
label in a checkbutton entry. If the entry is selected then
the indicator&rsquo;s center is displayed in the color given
by the <b>&minus;selectcolor</b> option for the entry;
otherwise the indicator&rsquo;s center is displayed in the
background color for the menu. If a <b>&minus;command</b>
option is specified for a checkbutton entry, then its value
is evaluated as a Tcl command each time the entry is
invoked; this happens after toggling the entry&rsquo;s
selected state.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>RADIOBUTTON
ENTRIES</b> <br>
A radiobutton menu entry behaves much like a radiobutton
widget. Radiobutton entries are organized in groups of which
only one entry may be selected at a time. Whenever a
particular entry becomes selected it stores a particular
value into a particular global variable (as determined by
the <b>&minus;value</b> and <b>&minus;variable</b> options
for the entry). This action causes any previously-selected
entry in the same group to deselect itself. Once an entry
has become selected, any change to the entry&rsquo;s
associated variable will cause the entry to deselect itself.
Grouping of radiobutton entries is determined by their
associated variables: if two entries have the same
associated variable then they are in the same group. An
indicator diamond is displayed to the left of the label in
each radiobutton entry. If the entry is selected then the
indicator&rsquo;s center is displayed in the color given by
the <b>&minus;selectcolor</b> option for the entry;
otherwise the indicator&rsquo;s center is displayed in the
background color for the menu. If a <b>&minus;command</b>
option is specified for a radiobutton entry, then its value
is evaluated as a Tcl command each time the entry is
invoked; this happens after selecting the entry.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>CASCADE
ENTRIES</b> <br>
A cascade entry is one with an associated menu (determined
by the <b>&minus;menu</b> option). Cascade entries allow the
construction of cascading menus. The <b>postcascade</b>
widget command can be used to post and unpost the associated
menu just next to of the cascade entry. The associated menu
must be a child of the menu containing the cascade entry
(this is needed in order for menu traversal to work
correctly).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A cascade entry
posts its associated menu by invoking a Tcl command of the
form</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><i>menu</i> <b>post</b> <i>x
y</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">where <i>menu</i> is the path
name of the associated menu, and <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> are
the root-window coordinates of the upper-right corner of the
cascade entry. On Unix, the lower-level menu is unposted by
executing a Tcl command with the form</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><i>menu</i> <b>unpost</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">where <i>menu</i> is the name
of the associated menu. On other platforms, the
platform&rsquo;s native code takes care of unposting the
menu.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If a
<b>&minus;command</b> option is specified for a cascade
entry then it is evaluated as a Tcl command whenever the
entry is invoked. This is not supported on Windows.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>TEAR-OFF
ENTRIES</b> <br>
A tear-off entry appears at the top of the menu if enabled
with the <b>tearOff</b> option. It is not like other menu
entries in that it cannot be created with the <b>add</b>
widget command and cannot be deleted with the <b>delete</b>
widget command. When a tear-off entry is created it appears
as a dashed line at the top of the menu. Under the default
bindings, invoking the tear-off entry causes a torn-off copy
to be made of the menu and all of its submenus.</p>

<h2>MENUBARS
<a name="MENUBARS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Any menu can be
set as a menubar for a toplevel window (see <b>toplevel</b>
command for syntax). On the Macintosh, whenever the toplevel
is in front, this menu&rsquo;s cascade items will appear in
the menubar across the top of the main monitor. On Windows
and Unix, this menu&rsquo;s items will be displayed in a
menubar across the top of the window. These menus will
behave according to the interface guidelines of their
platforms. For every menu set as a menubar, a clone menu is
made. See the <b>CLONES</b> section for more
information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As noted,
menubars may behave differently on different platforms. One
example of this concerns the handling of checkbuttons and
radiobuttons within the menu. While it is permitted to put
these menu elements on menubars, they may not be drawn with
indicators on some platforms, due to system
restrictions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>SPECIAL
MENUS IN MENUBARS</b> <br>
Certain menus in a menubar will be treated specially. On the
Macintosh, access to the special Application and Help menus
is provided. On Windows, access to the Windows System menu
in each window is provided. On X Windows, a special
right-justified help menu may be provided if Motif menu
compatibility is enabled. In all cases, these menus must be
created with the command name of the menubar menu
concatenated with the special name. So for a menubar named
.menubar, on the Macintosh, the special menus would be
.menubar.apple and .menubar.help; on Windows, the special
menu would be .menubar.system; on X Windows, the help menu
would be .menubar.help.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When Tk sees a
.menubar.apple menu on the Macintosh, that menu&rsquo;s
contents make up the first items of the Application menu
whenever the window containing the menubar is in front.
After all of the Tk-defined items, the menu will have a
separator, followed by all standard Application menu
items.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When Tk sees a
Help menu on the Macintosh, the menu&rsquo;s contents are
appended to the standard Help menu on the right of the
user&rsquo;s menubar whenever the window&rsquo;s menubar is
in front. The first items in the menu are provided by Mac OS
X.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When Tk sees a
System menu on Windows, its items are appended to the system
menu that the menubar is attached to. This menu has an icon
representing a spacebar, and can be invoked with the mouse
or by typing Alt+Spacebar. Due to limitations in the Windows
API, any font changes, colors, images, bitmaps, or tearoff
images will not appear in the system menu.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When Tk sees a
Help menu on X Windows and Motif menu compatibility is
enabled the menu is moved to be last in the menubar and is
right justified. Motif menu compatibility is enabled by
setting the Tk option <b>*Menu.useMotifHelp</b> to true or
by calling <b>tk::classic::restore menu</b>.</p>

<h2>CLONES
<a name="CLONES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When a menu is
set as a menubar for a toplevel window, or when a menu is
torn off, a clone of the menu is made. This clone is a menu
widget in its own right, but it is a child of the original.
Changes in the configuration of the original are reflected
in the clone. Additionally, any cascades that are pointed to
are also cloned so that menu traversal will work right.
Clones are destroyed when either the tearoff or menubar goes
away, or when the original menu is destroyed.</p>

<h2>WIDGET COMMAND
<a name="WIDGET COMMAND"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The <b>menu</b>
command creates a new Tcl command whose name is
<i>pathName</i>. This command may be used to invoke various
operations on the widget. It has the following general
form:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><i>pathName option</i> ?<i>arg
arg ...</i>?</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>Option</i> and the
<i>arg</i>s determine the exact behavior of the command.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Many of the
widget commands for a menu take as one argument an indicator
of which entry of the menu to operate on. These indicators
are called <i>index</i>es and may be specified in any of the
following forms:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="11%">


<p><i>number</i></p></td>
<td width="7%"></td>
<td width="71%">


<p>Specifies the entry numerically, where 0 corresponds to
the top-most entry of the menu, 1 to the entry below it, and
so on.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="11%">


<p><b>active</b></p></td>
<td width="7%"></td>
<td width="71%">


<p>Indicates the entry that is currently active. If no
entry is active then this form is equivalent to <b>none</b>.
This form may not be abbreviated.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="11%">


<p><b>end</b></p></td>
<td width="7%"></td>
<td width="71%">


<p>Indicates the bottommost entry in the menu. If there are
no entries in the menu then this form is equivalent to
<b>none</b>. This form may not be abbreviated.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="11%">


<p><b>last</b></p></td>
<td width="7%"></td>
<td width="71%">


<p>Same as <b>end</b>.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="11%">


<p><b>none</b></p></td>
<td width="7%"></td>
<td width="71%">


<p>Indicates &ldquo;no entry at all&rdquo;; this is used
most commonly with the <b>activate</b> option to deactivate
all the entries in the menu. In most cases the specification
of <b>none</b> causes nothing to happen in the widget
command. This form may not be abbreviated.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="11%">


<p><b>@</b><i>number</i></p></td>
<td width="7%"></td>
<td width="71%">


<p>In this form, <i>number</i> is treated as a y-coordinate
in the menu&rsquo;s window; the entry closest to that
y-coordinate is used. For example, &ldquo;<b>@0</b>&rdquo;
indicates the top-most entry in the window.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="11%">


<p><i>pattern</i></p></td>
<td width="7%"></td>
<td width="71%">


<p>If the index does not satisfy one of the above forms
then this form is used. <i>Pattern</i> is pattern-matched
against the label of each entry in the menu, in order from
the top down, until a matching entry is found. The rules of
<b>Tcl_StringMatch</b> are used.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
widget commands are possible for menu widgets: <i><br>
pathName</i> <b>activate</b> <i>index</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Change the state of the entry
indicated by <i>index</i> to <b>active</b> and redisplay it
using its active colors. Any previously-active entry is
deactivated. If <i>index</i> is specified as <b>none</b>, or
if the specified entry is disabled, then the menu ends up
with no active entry. Returns an empty string.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>pathName</i> <b>add</b>
<i>type</i> ?<i>option value option value ...</i>?</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Add a new entry to the bottom
of the menu. The new entry&rsquo;s type is given by
<i>type</i> and must be one of <b>cascade</b>,
<b>checkbutton</b>, <b>command</b>, <b>radiobutton</b>, or
<b>separator</b>, or a unique abbreviation of one of the
above. If additional arguments are present, they specify any
of the following options: <b><br>
&minus;activebackground</b> <i>value</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Specifies a background color to
use for displaying this entry when it is active. If this
option is specified as an empty string (the default), then
the <b>activeBackground</b> option for the overall menu is
used. If the <b>tk_strictMotif</b> variable has been set to
request strict Motif compliance, then this option is ignored
and the <b>&minus;background</b> option is used in its
place. This option is not available for separator or
tear-off entries.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>&minus;activeforeground</b>
<i>value</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Specifies a foreground color to
use for displaying this entry when it is active. If this
option is specified as an empty string (the default), then
the <b>activeForeground</b> option for the overall menu is
used. This option is not available for separator or tear-off
entries.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>&minus;accelerator</b>
<i>value</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Specifies a string to display
at the right side of the menu entry. Normally describes an
accelerator keystroke sequence that may be typed to invoke
the same function as the menu entry. This option is not
available for separator or tear-off entries.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>&minus;background</b>
<i>value</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Specifies a background color to
use for displaying this entry when it is in the normal state
(neither active nor disabled). If this option is specified
as an empty string (the default), then the <b>background</b>
option for the overall menu is used. This option is not
available for separator or tear-off entries.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>&minus;bitmap</b>
<i>value</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Specifies a bitmap to display
in the menu instead of a textual label, in any of the forms
accepted by <b>Tk_GetBitmap</b>. This option overrides the
<b>&minus;label</b> option (as controlled by the
<b>&minus;compound</b> option) but may be reset to an empty
string to enable a textual label to be displayed. If a
<b>&minus;image</b> option has been specified, it overrides
<b>&minus;bitmap</b>. This option is not available for
separator or tear-off entries.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>&minus;columnbreak</b>
<i>value</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">When this option is zero, the
entry appears below the previous entry. When this option is
one, the entry appears at the top of a new column in the
menu.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>&minus;command</b>
<i>value</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Specifies a Tcl command to
execute when the menu entry is invoked. Not available for
separator or tear-off entries.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>&minus;compound</b>
<i>value</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Specifies whether the menu
entry should display both an image and text, and if so,
where the image should be placed relative to the text. Valid
values for this option are <b>bottom</b>, <b>center</b>,
<b>left</b>, <b>none</b>, <b>right</b> and <b>top</b>. The
default value is <b>none</b>, meaning that the button will
display either an image or text, depending on the values of
the <b>&minus;image</b> and <b>&minus;bitmap</b>
options.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>&minus;font</b>
<i>value</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Specifies the font to use when
drawing the label or accelerator string in this entry. If
this option is specified as an empty string (the default)
then the <b>font</b> option for the overall menu is used.
This option is not available for separator or tear-off
entries.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>&minus;foreground</b>
<i>value</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Specifies a foreground color to
use for displaying this entry when it is in the normal state
(neither active nor disabled). If this option is specified
as an empty string (the default), then the <b>foreground</b>
option for the overall menu is used. This option is not
available for separator or tear-off entries.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>&minus;hidemargin</b>
<i>value</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Specifies whether the standard
margins should be drawn for this menu entry. This is useful
when creating palette with images in them, i.e., color
palettes, pattern palettes, etc. 1 indicates that the margin
for the entry is hidden; 0 means that the margin is
used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>&minus;image</b>
<i>value</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Specifies an image to display
in the menu instead of a text string or bitmap. The image
must have been created by some previous invocation of
<b>image create</b>. This option overrides the
<b>&minus;label</b> and <b>&minus;bitmap</b> options (as
controlled by the <b>&minus;compound</b> option) but may be
reset to an empty string to enable a textual or bitmap label
to be displayed. This option is not available for separator
or tear-off entries.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>&minus;indicatoron</b>
<i>value</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Available only for checkbutton
and radiobutton entries. <i>Value</i> is a boolean that
determines whether or not the indicator should be
displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>&minus;label</b>
<i>value</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Specifies a string to display
as an identifying label in the menu entry. Not available for
separator or tear-off entries.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>&minus;menu</b>
<i>value</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Available only for cascade
entries. Specifies the path name of the submenu associated
with this entry. The submenu must be a child of the
menu.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>&minus;offvalue</b>
<i>value</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Available only for checkbutton
entries. Specifies the value to store in the entry&rsquo;s
associated variable when the entry is deselected.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>&minus;onvalue</b>
<i>value</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Available only for checkbutton
entries. Specifies the value to store in the entry&rsquo;s
associated variable when the entry is selected.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>&minus;selectcolor</b>
<i>value</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Available only for checkbutton
and radiobutton entries. Specifies the color to display in
the indicator when the entry is selected. If the value is an
empty string (the default) then the <b>selectColor</b>
option for the menu determines the indicator color.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>&minus;selectimage</b>
<i>value</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Available only for checkbutton
and radiobutton entries. Specifies an image to display in
the entry (in place of the <b>&minus;image</b> option) when
it is selected. <i>Value</i> is the name of an image, which
must have been created by some previous invocation of
<b>image create</b>. This option is ignored unless the
<b>&minus;image</b> option has been specified.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>&minus;state</b>
<i>value</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Specifies one of three states
for the entry: <b>normal</b>, <b>active</b>, or
<b>disabled</b>. In normal state the entry is displayed
using the <b>foreground</b> option for the menu and the
<b>background</b> option from the entry or the menu. The
active state is typically used when the pointer is over the
entry. In active state the entry is displayed using the
<b>activeForeground</b> option for the menu along with the
<b>activebackground</b> option from the entry. Disabled
state means that the entry should be insensitive: the
default bindings will refuse to activate or invoke the
entry. In this state the entry is displayed according to the
<b>disabledForeground</b> option for the menu and the
<b>background</b> option from the entry. This option is not
available for separator entries.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>&minus;underline</b>
<i>value</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Specifies the integer index of
a character to underline in the entry. This option is also
queried by the default bindings and used to implement
keyboard traversal. 0 corresponds to the first character of
the text displayed in the entry, 1 to the next character,
and so on. If a bitmap or image is displayed in the entry
then this option is ignored. This option is not available
for separator or tear-off entries.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>&minus;value</b>
<i>value</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Available only for radiobutton
entries. Specifies the value to store in the entry&rsquo;s
associated variable when the entry is selected. If an empty
string is specified, then the <b>&minus;label</b> option for
the entry as the value to store in the variable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>&minus;variable</b>
<i>value</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Available only for checkbutton
and radiobutton entries. Specifies the name of a global
variable to set when the entry is selected. For checkbutton
entries the variable is also set when the entry is
deselected. For radiobutton entries, changing the variable
causes the currently-selected entry to deselect itself.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The <b>add</b>
widget command returns an empty string.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>pathName</i> <b>cget</b>
<i>option</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Returns the current value of
the configuration option given by <i>option</i>.
<i>Option</i> may have any of the values accepted by the
<b>menu</b> command.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>pathName</i> <b>clone</b>
<i>newPathname ?cloneType?</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Makes a clone of the current
menu named <i>newPathName</i>. This clone is a menu in its
own right, but any changes to the clone are propagated to
the original menu and vice versa. <i>cloneType</i> can be
<b>normal</b>, <b>menubar</b>, or <b>tearoff</b>. Should not
normally be called outside of the Tk library. See the
<b>CLONES</b> section for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>pathName</i>
<b>configure</b> ?<i>option</i>? ?<i>value option value
...</i>?</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Query or modify the
configuration options of the widget. If no <i>option</i> is
specified, returns a list describing all of the available
options for <i>pathName</i> (see <b>Tk_ConfigureInfo</b> for
information on the format of this list). If <i>option</i> is
specified with no <i>value</i>, then the command returns a
list describing the one named option (this list will be
identical to the corresponding sublist of the value returned
if no <i>option</i> is specified). If one or more
<i>option&minus;value</i> pairs are specified, then the
command modifies the given widget option(s) to have the
given value(s); in this case the command returns an empty
string. <i>Option</i> may have any of the values accepted by
the <b>menu</b> command.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>pathName</i> <b>delete</b>
<i>index1</i> ?<i>index2</i>?</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Delete all of the menu entries
between <i>index1</i> and <i>index2</i> inclusive. If
<i>index2</i> is omitted then it defaults to <i>index1</i>.
Attempts to delete a tear-off menu entry are ignored
(instead, you should change the <b>tearOff</b> option to
remove the tear-off entry).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>pathName</i>
<b>entrycget</b> <i>index option</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Returns the current value of a
configuration option for the entry given by <i>index</i>.
<i>Option</i> may have any of the values accepted by the
<b>add</b> widget command.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>pathName</i>
<b>entryconfigure</b> <i>index</i> ?<i>options</i>?</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This command is similar to the
<b>configure</b> command, except that it applies to the
options for an individual entry, whereas <b>configure</b>
applies to the options for the menu as a whole.
<i>Options</i> may have any of the values accepted by the
<b>add</b> widget command. If <i>options</i> are specified,
options are modified as indicated in the command and the
command returns an empty string. If no <i>options</i> are
specified, returns a list describing the current options for
entry <i>index</i> (see <b>Tk_ConfigureInfo</b> for
information on the format of this list).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>pathName</i> <b>index</b>
<i>index</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Returns the numerical index
corresponding to <i>index</i>, or <b>none</b> if
<i>index</i> was specified as <b>none</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>pathName</i> <b>insert</b>
<i>index type</i> ?<i>option value option value ...</i>?</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Same as the <b>add</b> widget
command except that it inserts the new entry just before the
entry given by <i>index</i>, instead of appending to the end
of the menu. The <i>type</i>, <i>option</i>, and
<i>value</i> arguments have the same interpretation as for
the <b>add</b> widget command. It is not possible to insert
new menu entries before the tear-off entry, if the menu has
one.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>pathName</i> <b>invoke</b>
<i>index</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Invoke the action of the menu
entry. See the sections on the individual entries above for
details on what happens. If the menu entry is disabled then
nothing happens. If the entry has a command associated with
it then the result of that command is returned as the result
of the <b>invoke</b> widget command. Otherwise the result is
an empty string. Note: invoking a menu entry does not
automatically unpost the menu; the default bindings normally
take care of this before invoking the <b>invoke</b> widget
command.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>pathName</i> <b>post</b>
<i>x y</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Arrange for the menu to be
displayed on the screen at the root-window coordinates given
by <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>. These coordinates are adjusted if
necessary to guarantee that the entire menu is visible on
the screen. This command normally returns an empty string.
If the <b>postCommand</b> option has been specified, then
its value is executed as a Tcl script before posting the
menu and the result of that script is returned as the result
of the <b>post</b> widget command. If an error returns while
executing the command, then the error is returned without
posting the menu.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>pathName</i>
<b>postcascade</b> <i>index</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Posts the submenu associated
with the cascade entry given by <i>index</i>, and unposts
any previously posted submenu. If <i>index</i> does not
correspond to a cascade entry, or if <i>pathName</i> is not
posted, the command has no effect except to unpost any
currently posted submenu.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>pathName</i> <b>type</b>
<i>index</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Returns the type of the menu
entry given by <i>index</i>. This is the <i>type</i>
argument passed to the <b>add</b> widget command when the
entry was created, such as <b>command</b> or
<b>separator</b>, or <b>tearoff</b> for a tear-off
entry.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>pathName</i>
<b>unpost</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Unmap the window so that it is
no longer displayed. If a lower-level cascaded menu is
posted, unpost that menu. Returns an empty string. This
subcommand does not work on Windows and the Macintosh, as
those platforms have their own way of unposting menus.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>pathName</i>
<b>xposition</b> <i>index</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Returns a decimal string giving
the x-coordinate within the menu <big>&#9474;</big> window
of the leftmost pixel in the entry specified by
<i>index</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>pathName</i>
<b>yposition</b> <i>index</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Returns a decimal string giving
the y-coordinate within the menu window of the topmost pixel
in the entry specified by <i>index</i>.</p>

<h2>MENU CONFIGURATIONS
<a name="MENU CONFIGURATIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The default
bindings support four different ways of using menus: <b><br>
Pulldown Menus in Menubar</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This is the most common case.
You create a menu widget that will become the menu bar. You
then add cascade entries to this menu, specifying the pull
down menus you wish to use in your menu bar. You then create
all of the pulldowns. Once you have done this, specify the
menu using the <b>&minus;menu</b> option of the
toplevel&rsquo;s widget command. See the <b>toplevel</b>
manual entry for details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Pulldown Menus in Menu
Buttons</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This is the compatible way to
do menu bars. You create one menubutton widget for each
top-level menu, and typically you arrange a series of
menubuttons in a row in a menubar window. You also create
the top-level menus and any cascaded submenus, and tie them
together with <b>&minus;menu</b> options in menubuttons and
cascade menu entries. The top-level menu must be a child of
the menubutton, and each submenu must be a child of the menu
that refers to it. Once you have done this, the default
bindings will allow users to traverse and invoke the tree of
menus via its menubutton; see the <b>menubutton</b> manual
entry for details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Popup Menus</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Popup menus typically post in
response to a mouse button press or keystroke. You create
the popup menus and any cascaded submenus, then you call the
<b>tk_popup</b> procedure at the appropriate time to post
the top-level menu.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Option Menus</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">An option menu consists of a
menubutton with an associated menu that allows you to select
one of several values. The current value is displayed in the
menubutton and is also stored in a global variable. Use the
<b>tk_optionMenu</b> procedure to create option menubuttons
and their menus.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Torn-off Menus</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">You create a torn-off menu by
invoking the tear-off entry at the top of an existing menu.
The default bindings will create a new menu that is a copy
of the original menu and leave it permanently posted as a
top-level window. The torn-off menu behaves just the same as
the original menu.</p>

<h2>DEFAULT BINDINGS
<a name="DEFAULT BINDINGS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Tk
automatically creates class bindings for menus that give
them the following default behavior:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="4%">


<p>[1]</p></td>
<td width="7%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>When the mouse enters a menu, the entry underneath the
mouse cursor activates; as the mouse moves around the menu,
the active entry changes to track the mouse.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="4%">


<p>[2]</p></td>
<td width="7%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>When the mouse leaves a menu all of the entries in the
menu deactivate, except in the special case where the mouse
moves from a menu to a cascaded submenu.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="4%">


<p>[3]</p></td>
<td width="7%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>When a button is released over a menu, the active entry
(if any) is invoked. The menu also unposts unless it is a
torn-off menu.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="4%">


<p>[4]</p></td>
<td width="7%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>The Space and Return keys invoke the active entry and
unpost the menu.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="4%">


<p>[5]</p></td>
<td width="7%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>If any of the entries in a menu have letters underlined
with the <b>&minus;underline</b> option, then pressing one
of the underlined letters (or its upper-case or lower-case
equivalent) invokes that entry and unposts the menu.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="4%">


<p>[6]</p></td>
<td width="7%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>The Escape key aborts a menu selection in progress
without invoking any entry. It also unposts the menu unless
it is a torn-off menu.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="4%">


<p>[7]</p></td>
<td width="7%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>The Up and Down keys activate the next higher or lower
entry in the menu. When one end of the menu is reached, the
active entry wraps around to the other end.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="4%">


<p>[8]</p></td>
<td width="7%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>The Left key moves to the next menu to the left. If the
current menu is a cascaded submenu, then the submenu is
unposted and the current menu entry becomes the cascade
entry in the parent. If the current menu is a top-level menu
posted from a menubutton, then the current menubutton is
unposted and the next menubutton to the left is posted.
Otherwise the key has no effect. The left-right order of
menubuttons is determined by their stacking order: Tk
assumes that the lowest menubutton (which by default is the
first one created) is on the left.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="4%">


<p>[9]</p></td>
<td width="7%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>The Right key moves to the next menu to the right. If
the current entry is a cascade entry, then the submenu is
posted and the current menu entry becomes the first entry in
the submenu. Otherwise, if the current menu was posted from
a menubutton, then the current menubutton is unposted and
the next menubutton to the right is posted.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Disabled menu
entries are non-responsive: they do not activate and they
ignore mouse button presses and releases.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Several of the
bindings make use of the command <b>tk_menuSetFocus</b>. It
saves the current focus and sets the focus to its
<i>pathName</i> argument, which is a menu widget.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The behavior of
menus can be changed by defining new bindings for individual
widgets or by redefining the class bindings.</p>
