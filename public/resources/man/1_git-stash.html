<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Use git stash
when you want to record the current state of the working
directory and the index, but want to go back to a clean
working directory. The command saves your local
modifications away and reverts the working directory to
match the HEAD commit.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
modifications stashed away by this command can be listed
with git stash list, inspected with git stash show, and
restored (potentially on top of a different commit) with git
stash apply. Calling git stash without any arguments is
equivalent to git stash save. A stash is by default listed
as &quot;WIP on <i>branchname</i> ...&quot;, but you can
give a more descriptive message on the command line when you
create one.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The latest
stash you created is stored in refs/stash; older stashes are
found in the reflog of this reference and can be named using
the usual reflog syntax (e.g. stash@{0} is the most recently
created stash, stash@{1} is the one before it,
stash@{2.hours.ago} is also possible).</p>

<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">save
[&minus;p|&minus;&minus;patch]
[&minus;&minus;[no&minus;]keep&minus;index]
[&minus;u|&minus;&minus;include&minus;untracked]
[&minus;a|&minus;&minus;all] [&minus;q|&minus;&minus;quiet]
[&lt;message&gt;]</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Save your local modifications
to a new <i>stash</i>, and run git reset &minus;&minus;hard
to revert them. The &lt;message&gt; part is optional and
gives the description along with the stashed state. For
quickly making a snapshot, you can omit <i>both</i>
&quot;save&quot; and &lt;message&gt;, but giving only
&lt;message&gt; does not trigger this action to prevent a
misspelled subcommand from making an unwanted stash.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If the
&minus;&minus;keep&minus;index option is used, all changes
already added to the index are left intact.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If the
&minus;&minus;include&minus;untracked option is used, all
untracked files are also stashed and then cleaned up with
git clean, leaving the working directory in a very clean
state. If the &minus;&minus;all option is used instead then
the ignored files are stashed and cleaned in addition to the
untracked files.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">With
&minus;&minus;patch, you can interactively select hunks from
the diff between HEAD and the working tree to be stashed.
The stash entry is constructed such that its index state is
the same as the index state of your repository, and its
worktree contains only the changes you selected
interactively. The selected changes are then rolled back
from your worktree. See the &ldquo;Interactive Mode&rdquo;
section of <b>git-add</b>(1) to learn how to operate the
&minus;&minus;patch mode.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The
&minus;&minus;patch option implies
&minus;&minus;keep&minus;index. You can use
&minus;&minus;no&minus;keep&minus;index to override
this.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">list
[&lt;options&gt;]</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">List the stashes that you
currently have. Each <i>stash</i> is listed with its name
(e.g. stash@{0} is the latest stash, stash@{1} is the one
before, etc.), the name of the branch that was current when
the stash was made, and a short description of the commit
the stash was based on.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">stash@{0}: WIP
on submit: 6ebd0e2... Update git&minus;stash documentation
<br>
stash@{1}: On master: 9cc0589... Add git&minus;stash</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The command
takes options applicable to the <i>git log</i> command to
control what is shown and how. See <b>git-log</b>(1).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">show
[&lt;stash&gt;]</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Show the changes recorded in
the stash as a diff between the stashed state and its
original parent. When no &lt;stash&gt; is given, shows the
latest one. By default, the command shows the diffstat, but
it will accept any format known to <i>git diff</i> (e.g.,
git stash show &minus;p stash@{1} to view the second most
recent stash in patch form).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">pop
[&minus;&minus;index] [&minus;q|&minus;&minus;quiet]
[&lt;stash&gt;]</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Remove a single stashed state
from the stash list and apply it on top of the current
working tree state, i.e., do the inverse operation of git
stash save. The working directory must match the index.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Applying the
state can fail with conflicts; in this case, it is not
removed from the stash list. You need to resolve the
conflicts by hand and call git stash drop manually
afterwards.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If the
&minus;&minus;index option is used, then tries to reinstate
not only the working tree&rsquo;s changes, but also the
index&rsquo;s ones. However, this can fail, when you have
conflicts (which are stored in the index, where you
therefore can no longer apply the changes as they were
originally).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">When no
&lt;stash&gt; is given, stash@{0} is assumed, otherwise
&lt;stash&gt; must be a reference of the form
stash@{&lt;revision&gt;}.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">apply
[&minus;&minus;index] [&minus;q|&minus;&minus;quiet]
[&lt;stash&gt;]</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Like pop, but do not remove the
state from the stash list. Unlike pop, &lt;stash&gt; may be
any commit that looks like a commit created by stash save or
stash create.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">branch
&lt;branchname&gt; [&lt;stash&gt;]</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Creates and checks out a new
branch named &lt;branchname&gt; starting from the commit at
which the &lt;stash&gt; was originally created, applies the
changes recorded in &lt;stash&gt; to the new working tree
and index. If that succeeds, and &lt;stash&gt; is a
reference of the form stash@{&lt;revision&gt;}, it then
drops the &lt;stash&gt;. When no &lt;stash&gt; is given,
applies the latest one.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This is useful
if the branch on which you ran git stash save has changed
enough that git stash apply fails due to conflicts. Since
the stash is applied on top of the commit that was HEAD at
the time git stash was run, it restores the originally
stashed state with no conflicts.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">clear</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Remove all the stashed states.
Note that those states will then be subject to pruning, and
may be impossible to recover (see <i>Examples</i> below for
a possible strategy).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">drop
[&minus;q|&minus;&minus;quiet] [&lt;stash&gt;]</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Remove a single stashed state
from the stash list. When no &lt;stash&gt; is given, it
removes the latest one. i.e. stash@{0}, otherwise
&lt;stash&gt; must be a valid stash log reference of the
form stash@{&lt;revision&gt;}.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">create</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Create a stash (which is a
regular commit object) and return its object name, without
storing it anywhere in the ref namespace.</p>

<h2>DISCUSSION
<a name="DISCUSSION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A stash is
represented as a commit whose tree records the state of the
working directory, and its first parent is the commit at
HEAD when the stash was created. The tree of the second
parent records the state of the index when the stash is
made, and it is made a child of the HEAD commit. The
ancestry graph looks like this:</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">.&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;W
<br>
/ / <br>

&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;H&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;I</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">where H is the
HEAD commit, I is a commit that records the state of the
index, and W is a commit that records the state of the
working tree.</p>

<h2>EXAMPLES
<a name="EXAMPLES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Pulling into a
dirty tree</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When you are in the middle of
something, you learn that there are upstream changes that
are possibly relevant to what you are doing. When your local
changes do not conflict with the changes in the upstream, a
simple git pull will let you move forward.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">However, there
are cases in which your local changes do conflict with the
upstream changes, and git pull refuses to overwrite your
changes. In such a case, you can stash your changes away,
perform a pull, and then unstash, like this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">$ git pull <br>
... <br>
file foobar not up to date, cannot merge. <br>
$ git stash <br>
$ git pull <br>
$ git stash pop</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Interrupted
workflow</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When you are in the middle of
something, your boss comes in and demands that you fix
something immediately. Traditionally, you would make a
commit to a temporary branch to store your changes away, and
return to your original branch to make the emergency fix,
like this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em"># ... hack hack
hack ... <br>
$ git checkout &minus;b my_wip <br>
$ git commit &minus;a &minus;m &quot;WIP&quot; <br>
$ git checkout master <br>
$ edit emergency fix <br>
$ git commit &minus;a &minus;m &quot;Fix in a hurry&quot;
<br>
$ git checkout my_wip <br>
$ git reset &minus;&minus;soft HEAD^ <br>
# ... continue hacking ...</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">You can use
<i>git stash</i> to simplify the above, like this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em"># ... hack hack
hack ... <br>
$ git stash <br>
$ edit emergency fix <br>
$ git commit &minus;a &minus;m &quot;Fix in a hurry&quot;
<br>
$ git stash pop <br>
# ... continue hacking ...</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Testing partial
commits</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">You can use git stash save
&minus;&minus;keep&minus;index when you want to make two or
more commits out of the changes in the work tree, and you
want to test each change before committing:</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em"># ... hack hack
hack ... <br>
$ git add &minus;&minus;patch foo # add just first part to
the index <br>
$ git stash save &minus;&minus;keep&minus;index # save all
other changes to the stash <br>
$ edit/build/test first part <br>
$ git commit &minus;m 'First part' # commit fully tested
change <br>
$ git stash pop # prepare to work on all other changes <br>
# ... repeat above five steps until one commit remains ...
<br>
$ edit/build/test remaining parts <br>
$ git commit foo &minus;m 'Remaining parts'</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Recovering
stashes that were cleared/dropped erroneously</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">If you mistakenly drop or clear
stashes, they cannot be recovered through the normal safety
mechanisms. However, you can try the following incantation
to get a list of stashes that are still in your repository,
but not reachable any more:</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">git fsck
&minus;&minus;unreachable | <br>
grep commit | cut &minus;d\ &minus;f3 | <br>
xargs git log &minus;&minus;merges
&minus;&minus;no&minus;walk &minus;&minus;grep=WIP</p>
