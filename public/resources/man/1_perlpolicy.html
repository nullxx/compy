</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">perlpolicy
&minus; Various and sundry policies and commitments related
to the Perl core</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This document
is the master document which records all written policies
about how the Perl 5 Porters collectively develop and
maintain the Perl core.</p>

<h2>GOVERNANCE
<a name="GOVERNANCE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Perl 5
Porters</b> <br>
Subscribers to perl5&minus;porters (the porters themselves)
come in several flavours. Some are quiet curious lurkers,
who rarely pitch in and instead watch the ongoing
development to ensure they&rsquo;re forewarned of new
changes or features in Perl. Some are representatives of
vendors, who are there to make sure that Perl continues to
compile and work on their platforms. Some patch any reported
bug that they know how to fix, some are actively patching
their pet area (threads, Win32, the regexp &minus;engine),
while others seem to do nothing but complain. In other
words, it&rsquo;s your usual mix of technical people.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Over this group
of porters presides Larry Wall. He has the final word in
what does and does not change in any of the Perl programming
languages. These days, Larry spends most of his time on Perl
6, while Perl 5 is shepherded by a &quot;pumpking&quot;, a
porter responsible for deciding what goes into each release
and ensuring that releases happen on a regular basis.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Larry sees Perl
development along the lines of the <small>US</small>
government: there&rsquo;s the Legislature (the porters), the
Executive branch (the &minus;pumpking), and the Supreme
Court (Larry). The legislature can discuss and submit
patches to the executive branch all they like, but the
executive branch is free to veto them. Rarely, the Supreme
Court will side with the executive branch over the
legislature, or the legislature over the executive branch.
Mostly, however, the legislature and the executive branch
are supposed to get along and work out their differences
without impeachment or court cases.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You might
sometimes see reference to Rule 1 and Rule 2. Larry&rsquo;s
power as Supreme Court is expressed in The Rules:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p>1.</p></td>
<td width="3%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>Larry is always by definition right about how Perl
should behave. This means he has final veto power on the
core functionality.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p>2.</p></td>
<td width="3%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>Larry is allowed to change his mind about any matter at
a later date, regardless of whether he previously invoked
Rule 1.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Got that? Larry
is always right, even when he was wrong. It&rsquo;s rare to
see either Rule exercised, but they are often alluded
to.</p>

<h2>MAINTENANCE AND SUPPORT
<a name="MAINTENANCE AND SUPPORT"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Perl 5 is
developed by a community, not a corporate entity. Every
change contributed to the Perl core is the result of a
donation. Typically, these donations are contributions of
code or time by individual members of our community. On
occasion, these donations come in the form of corporate or
organizational sponsorship of a particular individual or
project.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As a volunteer
organization, the commitments we make are heavily dependent
on the goodwill and hard work of individuals who have no
obligation to contribute to Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">That being
said, we value Perl&rsquo;s stability and security and have
long had an unwritten covenant with the broader Perl
community to support and maintain releases of Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This document
codifies the support and maintenance commitments that the
Perl community should expect from Perl&rsquo;s
developers:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&bull;</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">We &quot;officially&quot;
support the two most recent stable release series. 5.12.x
and earlier are now out of support. As of the release of
5.18.0, we will &quot;officially&quot; end support for Perl
5.14.x, other than providing security updates as described
below.</p> </td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>&bull;</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>To the best of our ability, we will attempt to fix
critical issues in the two most recent stable 5.x release
series. Fixes for the current release series take precedence
over fixes for the previous release series.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>&bull;</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>To the best of our ability, we will provide
&quot;critical&quot; security patches / releases for any
major version of Perl whose 5.x.0 release was within the
past three years. We can only commit to providing these for
the most recent .y release in any 5.x.y series.</p></td></tr>

<td width="1%">


<p>&bull;</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>

<td width="1%">


<p>&bull;</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>As a vendor, you may have a requirement to backport
security fixes beyond our 3 year support commitment. We can
provide limited support and advice to you as you do so and,
where possible will try to apply those patches to the
relevant &minus;maint branches in git, though we may or may
not choose to make numbered releases or &quot;official&quot;
patches available. Contact us at
&lt;perl5&minus;security&minus;report@perl.org&gt; to begin
that process.</p></td></tr>

<h2>BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY AND DEPRECATION
<a name="BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY AND DEPRECATION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Our community
has a long-held belief that backward-compatibility is a
virtue, even when the functionality in question is a design
flaw.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">We would all
love to unmake some mistakes we&rsquo;ve made over the past
decades. Living with every design error we&rsquo;ve ever
made can lead to painful stagnation. Unwinding our mistakes
is very, very difficult. Doing so without actively harming
our users is nearly impossible.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Lately,
ignoring or actively opposing compatibility with earlier
versions of Perl has come into vogue. Sometimes, a change is
proposed which wants to usurp syntax which previously had
another meaning. Sometimes, a change wants to improve
previously-crazy semantics.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Down this road
lies madness.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Requiring
end-user programmers to change just a few language
constructs, even language constructs which no well-educated
developer would ever intentionally use is tantamount to
saying &quot;you should not upgrade to a new release of Perl
unless you have 100% test coverage and can do a full manual
audit of your codebase.&quot; If we were to have tools
capable of reliably upgrading Perl source code from one
version of Perl to another, this concern could be
significantly mitigated.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">We want to
ensure that Perl continues to grow and flourish in the
coming years and decades, but not at the expense of our user
community.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Existing syntax
and semantics should only be marked for destruction in very
limited circumstances. If a given language feature&rsquo;s
continued inclusion in the language will cause significant
harm to the language or prevent us from making needed
changes to the runtime, then it may be considered for
deprecation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Any language
change which breaks backward-compatibility should be able to
be enabled or disabled lexically. Unless code at a given
scope declares that it wants the new behavior, that new
behavior should be disabled. Which backward-incompatible
changes are controlled implicitly by a &rsquo;use
v5.x.y&rsquo; is a decision which should be made by the
pumpking in consultation with the community.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When a
backward-incompatible change can&rsquo;t be toggled
lexically, the decision to change the language must be
considered very, very carefully. If it&rsquo;s possible to
move the old syntax or semantics out of the core language
and into XS-land, that <small>XS</small> module should be
enabled by default unless the user declares that they want a
newer revision of Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Historically,
we&rsquo;ve held ourselves to a far higher standard than
backward-compatibility -- bugward-compatibility. Any
accident of implementation or unintentional side-effect of
running some bit of code has been considered to be a feature
of the language to be defended with the same zeal as any
other feature or functionality. No matter how frustrating
these unintentional features may be to us as we continue to
improve Perl, these unintentional features often deserve our
protection. It is very important that existing software
written in Perl continue to work correctly. If end-user
developers have adopted a bug as a feature, we need to treat
it as such.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">New syntax and
semantics which don&rsquo;t break existing language
constructs and syntax have a much lower bar. They merely
need to prove themselves to be useful, elegant, well
designed, and well tested.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Terminology</b>
<br>
To make sure we&rsquo;re talking about the same thing when
we discuss the removal of features or functionality from the
Perl core, we have specific definitions for a few words and
phrases. <br>
experimental</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">If something in the Perl core
is marked as <b>experimental</b>, we may change its
behaviour, deprecate or remove it without notice. While
we&rsquo;ll always do our best to smooth the transition path
for users of experimental features, you should contact the
perl5&minus;porters mailinglist if you find an experimental
feature useful and want to help shape its future.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">deprecated</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">If something in the Perl core
is marked as <b>deprecated</b>, we may remove it from the
core in the next stable release series, though we may not.
As of Perl 5.12, deprecated features and modules warn the
user as they&rsquo;re used. If you use a deprecated feature
and believe that its removal from the Perl core would be a
mistake, please contact the perl5&minus;porters mailinglist
and plead your case. We don&rsquo;t deprecate things without
a good reason, but sometimes there&rsquo;s a counterargument
we haven&rsquo;t considered. Historically, we did not
distinguish between &quot;deprecated&quot; and
&quot;discouraged&quot; features.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">discouraged</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">From time to time, we may mark
language constructs and features which we consider to have
been mistakes as <b>discouraged</b>. Discouraged features
aren&rsquo;t candidates for removal in the next major
release series, but we may later deprecate them if
they&rsquo;re found to stand in the way of a significant
improvement to the Perl core.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">removed</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Once a feature, construct or
module has been marked as deprecated for a stable release
cycle, we may remove it from the Perl core. Unsurprisingly,
we say we&rsquo;ve <b>removed</b> these things.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Getting
changes into a maint branch</b> <br>
Historically, only the pumpking cherry-picked changes from
bleadperl into maintperl. This has...scaling problems. At
the same time, maintenance branches of stable versions of
Perl need to be treated with great care. To that end,
we&rsquo;re going to try out a new process for
maint&minus;5.12.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Any committer
may cherry-pick any commit from blead to maint&minus;5.12 if
they send mail to perl5&minus;porters announcing their
intent to cherry-pick a specific commit along with a
rationale for doing so and at least two other committers
respond to the list giving their assent. (This policy
applies to current and former pumpkings, as well as other
committers.)</p>

<h2>CONTRIBUTED MODULES
<a name="CONTRIBUTED MODULES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>A Social
Contract about Artistic Control</b> <br>
What follows is a statement about artistic control, defined
as the ability of authors of packages to guide the future of
their code and maintain control over their work. It is a
recognition that authors should have control over their
work, and that it is a responsibility of the rest of the
Perl community to ensure that they retain this control. It
is an attempt to document the standards to which we, as Perl
developers, intend to hold ourselves. It is an attempt to
write down rough guidelines about the respect we owe each
other as Perl developers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This statement
is not a legal contract. This statement is not a legal
document in any way, shape, or form. Perl is distributed
under the <small>GNU</small> Public License and under the
Artistic License; those are the precise legal terms. This
statement isn&rsquo;t about the law or licenses. It&rsquo;s
about community, mutual respect, trust, and good-faith
cooperation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">We recognize
that the Perl core, defined as the software distributed with
the heart of Perl itself, is a joint project on the part of
all of us. From time to time, a script, module, or set of
modules (hereafter referred to simply as a
&quot;module&quot;) will prove so widely useful and/or so
integral to the correct functioning of Perl itself that it
should be distributed with the Perl core. This should never
be done without the author&rsquo;s explicit consent, and a
clear recognition on all parts that this means the module is
being distributed under the same terms as Perl itself. A
module author should realize that inclusion of a module into
the Perl core will necessarily mean some loss of control
over it, since changes may occasionally have to be made on
short notice or for consistency with the rest of Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Once a module
has been included in the Perl core, however, everyone
involved in maintaining Perl should be aware that the module
is still the property of the original author unless the
original author explicitly gives up their ownership of it.
In particular:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&bull;</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">The version of the module in the
Perl core should still be considered the work of the
original author. All patches, bug reports, and so forth
should be fed back to them. Their development directions
should be respected whenever possible.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>&bull;</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>Patches may be applied by the pumpkin holder without the
explicit cooperation of the module author if and only if
they are very minor, time-critical in some fashion (such as
urgent security fixes), or if the module author cannot be
reached. Those patches must still be given back to the
author when possible, and if the author decides on an
alternate fix in their version, that fix should be strongly
preferred unless there is a serious problem with it. Any
changes not endorsed by the author should be marked as such,
and the contributor of the change acknowledged.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>&bull;</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>The version of the module distributed with Perl should,
whenever possible, be the latest version of the module as
distributed by the author (the latest non-beta version in
the case of public Perl releases), although the pumpkin
holder may hold off on upgrading the version of the module
distributed with Perl to the latest version until the latest
version has had sufficient testing.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In other words,
the author of a module should be considered to have final
say on modifications to their module whenever possible
(bearing in mind that it&rsquo;s expected that everyone
involved will work together and arrive at reasonable
compromises when there are disagreements).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As a last
resort, however:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the
author&rsquo;s vision of the future of their module is
sufficiently different from the vision of the pumpkin holder
and perl5&minus;porters as a whole so as to cause serious
problems for Perl, the pumpkin holder may choose to formally
fork the version of the module in the Perl core from the one
maintained by the author. This should not be done lightly
and should <b>always</b> if at all possible be done only
after direct input from Larry. If this is done, it must then
be made explicit in the module as distributed with the Perl
core that it is a forked version and that while it is based
on the original author&rsquo;s work, it is no longer
maintained by them. This must be noted in both the
documentation and in the comments in the source of the
module.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Again, this
should be a last resort only. Ideally, this should never
happen, and every possible effort at cooperation and
compromise should be made before doing this. If it does
prove necessary to fork a module for the overall health of
Perl, proper credit must be given to the original author in
perpetuity and the decision should be constantly
re-evaluated to see if a remerging of the two branches is
possible down the road.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In all dealings
with contributed modules, everyone maintaining Perl should
keep in mind that the code belongs to the original author,
that they may not be on perl5&minus;porters at any given
time, and that a patch is not official unless it has been
integrated into the author&rsquo;s copy of the module. To
aid with this, and with points #1, #2, and #3 above, contact
information for the authors of all contributed modules
should be kept with the Perl distribution.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Finally, the
Perl community as a whole recognizes that respect for
ownership of code, respect for artistic control, proper
credit, and active effort to prevent unintentional code skew
or communication gaps is vital to the health of the
community and Perl itself. Members of a community should not
normally have to resort to rules and laws to deal with each
other, and this document, although it contains rules so as
to be clear, is about an attitude and general approach. The
first step in any dispute should be open communication,
respect for opposing views, and an attempt at a compromise.
In nearly every circumstance nothing more will be necessary,
and certainly no more drastic measure should be used until
every avenue of communication and discussion has failed.</p>

<h2>DOCUMENTATION
<a name="DOCUMENTATION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Perl&rsquo;s
documentation is an important resource for our users.
It&rsquo;s incredibly important for Perl&rsquo;s
documentation to be reasonably coherent and to accurately
reflect the current implementation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Just as P5P
collectively maintains the codebase, we collectively
maintain the documentation. Writing a particular bit of
documentation doesn&rsquo;t give an author control of the
future of that documentation. At the same time, just as
source code changes should match the style of their
surrounding blocks, so should documentation changes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Examples in
documentation should be illustrative of the concept
they&rsquo;re explaining. Sometimes, the best way to show
how a language feature works is with a small program the
reader can run without modification. More often, examples
will consist of a snippet of code containing only the
&quot;important&quot; bits. The definition of
&quot;important&quot; varies from snippet to snippet.
Sometimes it&rsquo;s important to declare <tt>&quot;use
strict&quot;</tt> and <tt>&quot;use warnings&quot;</tt>,
initialize all variables and fully catch every error
condition. More often than not, though, those things obscure
the lesson the example was intended to teach.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As Perl is
developed by a global team of volunteers, our documentation
often contains spellings which look funny to
<i>somebody</i>. Choice of American/British/Other spellings
is left as an exercise for the author of each bit of
documentation. When patching documentation, try to emulate
the documentation around you, rather than changing the
existing prose.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In general,
documentation should describe what Perl does &quot;now&quot;
rather than what it used to do. It&rsquo;s perfectly
reasonable to include notes in documentation about how
behaviour has changed from previous releases, but, with very
few exceptions, documentation isn&rsquo;t
&quot;dual-life&quot; -- it doesn&rsquo;t need to fully
describe how all old versions used to work.</p>
