<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">perlwin32
&minus; Perl under Windows</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These are
instructions for building Perl under Windows 2000 and
later.</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Before you
start, you should glance through the <small>README</small>
file found in the top-level directory to which the Perl
distribution was extracted. Make sure you read and
understand the terms under which this software is being
distributed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Also make sure
you read &quot; <small>BUGS AND CAVEATS</small> &quot; below
for the known limitations of this port.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<small>INSTALL</small> file in the perl top-level has much
information that is only relevant to people building Perl on
Unix-like systems. In particular, you can safely ignore any
information that talks about &quot;Configure&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You may also
want to look at one other option for building a perl that
will work on Windows: the <small>README</small> .cygwin
file, which give a different set of rules to build a perl
for Windows. This method will probably enable you to build a
more Unix-compatible perl, but you will also need to
download and use various other build-time and run-time
support software described in that file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This set of
instructions is meant to describe a so-called
&quot;native&quot; port of Perl to the Windows platform.
This includes both 32&minus;bit and 64&minus;bit Windows
operating systems. The resulting Perl requires no additional
software to run (other than what came with your operating
system). Currently, this port is capable of using one of the
following compilers on the Intel x86 architecture:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">      Microsoft Visual C++    version 6.0 or later
      Gcc by mingw.org        gcc version 3.2 or later
      Gcc by mingw&minus;w64.sf.net gcc version 4.4.3 or later</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that the
last two of these are actually competing projects both
delivering complete gcc toolchain for <small>MS</small>
Windows: <br>
&lt;http://mingw.org&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Delivers gcc toolchain
targeting 32&minus;bit Windows platform.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">http://mingw&minus;w64.sf.net
&lt;http://mingw-w64.sf.net&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Delivers gcc toolchain
targeting both 64&minus;bit Windows and 32&minus;bit Windows
platforms (despite the project name
&quot;mingw&minus;w64&quot; they are not only 64&minus;bit
oriented). They deliver the native gcc compilers and
cross-compilers that are also supported by perl&rsquo;s
makefile.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The Microsoft
Visual C <small>++</small> compilers are also now being
given away free. They are available as &quot;Visual C
<small>++</small> Toolkit 2003&quot; or &quot;Visual C
<small>++</small> 2005/2008/2010 Express Edition&quot; (and
also as part of the &quot;.NET Framework <small>SDK</small>
&quot;) and are the same compilers that ship with
&quot;Visual C <small>++</small> .NET 2003
Professional&quot; or &quot;Visual C <small>++</small>
2005/2008/2010 Professional&quot; respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This port can
also be built on <small>IA64/AMD64</small> using:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">      Microsoft Platform SDK    Nov 2001 (64&minus;bit compiler and tools)
      MinGW64 compiler (gcc version 4.4.3 or later)</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The Windows
<small>SDK</small> can be downloaded from
&lt;http://www.microsoft.com/&gt;. The MinGW64 compiler is
available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw&minus;w64
&lt;http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64&gt;. The
latter is actually a cross-compiler targeting Win64.
There&rsquo;s also a trimmed down compiler (no java, or
gfortran) suitable for building perl available at:
&lt;http://strawberryperl.com/package/kmx/64_gcctoolchain/&gt;</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><small>NOTE:</small>
If you&rsquo;re using a 32&minus;bit compiler to build perl
on a 64&minus;bit Windows operating system, then you should
set the <small>WIN64</small> environment variable to
&quot;undef&quot;. Also, the trimmed down compiler only
passes tests when <small>USE_ITHREADS</small> *= define (as
opposed to undef) and when the <small>CFG</small> *= Debug
line is commented out.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This port fully
supports MakeMaker (the set of modules that is used to build
extensions to perl). Therefore, you should be able to build
and install most extensions found in the <small>CPAN</small>
sites. See &quot;Usage Hints for Perl on Windows&quot; below
for general hints about this.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Setting Up
Perl on Windows</b> <br>
Make</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">You need a &quot;make&quot;
program to build the sources. If you are using Visual C
<small>++</small> or the Windows <small>SDK</small> tools,
nmake will work. Builds using the gcc need dmake.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">dmake is a
freely available make that has very nice macro features and
parallelability.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">A port of dmake
for Windows is available from:</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&lt;http://search.cpan.org/dist/dmake/&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Fetch and
install dmake somewhere on your path.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Command Shell</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Use the default &quot;cmd&quot;
shell that comes with Windows. Some versions of the popular
4DOS/NT shell have incompatibilities that may cause you
trouble. If the build fails under that shell, try building
again with the cmd shell.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Make sure the
path to the build directory does not contain spaces. The
build usually works in this circumstance, but some tests
will fail.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Microsoft Visual C
<small>++</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The nmake that comes with
Visual C <small>++</small> will suffice for building. You
will need to run the <small>VCVARS32</small> .BAT file,
usually found somewhere like C:\Program Files\Microsoft
Visual Studio\VC98\Bin. This will set your build
environment.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">You can also
use dmake to build using Visual C <small>++</small> ;
provided, however, you set <small>OSRELEASE</small> to
&quot;microsft&quot; (or whatever the directory name under
which the Visual C dmake configuration lives) in your
environment and edit win32/config.vc to change
&quot;make=nmake&quot; into &quot;make=dmake&quot;. The
latter step is only essential if you want to use dmake as
your default make for building extensions using
MakeMaker.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Microsoft Visual C
<small>++</small> 2008/2010 Express Edition</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">These free versions of Visual C
<small>++</small> 2008/2010 Professional contain the same
compilers and linkers that ship with the full versions, and
also contain everything necessary to build Perl, rather than
requiring a separate download of the Windows
<small>SDK</small> like previous versions did.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">These packages
can be downloaded by searching in the Download Center at
&lt;http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/search.aspx?displaylang=en&gt;.
(Providing exact links to these packages has proven a
pointless task because the links keep on changing so
often.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Install Visual
C <small>++</small> 2008/2010 Express, then setup your
environment using, e.g.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">        C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\Common7\Tools\vsvars32.bat</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">(assuming the
default installation location was chosen).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Perl should now
build using the win32/Makefile. You will need to edit that
file to set <small>CCTYPE</small> to
<small>MSVC90FREE</small> or <small>MSVC100FREE</small>
first.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Microsoft Visual C
<small>++</small> 2005 Express Edition</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This free version of Visual C
<small>++</small> 2005 Professional contains the same
compiler and linker that ship with the full version, but
doesn&rsquo;t contain everything necessary to build
Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">You will also
need to download the &quot;Windows <small>SDK</small> &quot;
(the &quot;Core <small>SDK</small> &quot; and &quot;
<small>MDAC SDK</small> &quot; components are required) for
more header files and libraries.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">These packages
can both be downloaded by searching in the Download Center
at
&lt;http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/search.aspx?displaylang=en&gt;.
(Providing exact links to these packages has proven a
pointless task because the links keep on changing so
often.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Try to obtain
the latest version of the Windows <small>SDK</small> .
Sometimes these packages contain a particular Windows
<small>OS</small> version in their name, but actually work
on other <small>OS</small> versions too. For example, the
&quot;Windows Server 2003 R2 Platform <small>SDK</small>
&quot; also runs on Windows <small>XP SP2</small> and
Windows 2000.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Install Visual
C <small>++</small> 2005 first, then the Platform
<small>SDK</small> . Setup your environment as follows
(assuming default installation locations were chosen):</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">        SET PlatformSDKDir=C:\Program Files\Microsoft Platform SDK
        SET PATH=%SystemRoot%\system32;%SystemRoot%;C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 8\Common7\IDE;C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 8\VC\BIN;C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 8\Common7\Tools;C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 8\SDK\v2.0\bin;C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v2.0.50727;C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 8\VC\VCPackages;%PlatformSDKDir%\Bin

        SET LIBPATH=C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v2.0.50727</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">(The
PlatformSDKDir might need to be set differently depending on
which version you are using. Earlier versions installed into
&quot;C:\Program Files\Microsoft <small>SDK</small> &quot;,
while the latest versions install into version-specific
locations such as &quot;C:\Program Files\Microsoft Platform
<small>SDK</small> for Windows Server 2003 R2&quot;.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Perl should now
build using the win32/Makefile. You will need to edit that
file to set</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">        CCTYPE = MSVC80FREE</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">and to set
<small>CCHOME</small> , <small>CCINCDIR</small> and
<small>CCLIBDIR</small> as per the environment setup
above.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Microsoft Visual C
<small>++</small> Toolkit 2003</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This free toolkit contains the
same compiler and linker that ship with Visual C
<small>++</small> .NET 2003 Professional, but doesn&rsquo;t
contain everything necessary to build Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">You will also
need to download the &quot;Platform <small>SDK</small>
&quot; (the &quot;Core <small>SDK</small> &quot; and &quot;
<small>MDAC SDK</small> &quot; components are required) for
header files, libraries and rc.exe, and &quot;.NET Framework
<small>SDK</small> &quot; for more libraries and nmake.exe.
Note that the latter (which also includes the free compiler
and linker) requires the &quot;.NET Framework
Redistributable&quot; to be installed first. This can be
downloaded and installed separately, but is included in the
&quot;Visual C <small>++</small> Toolkit 2003&quot;
anyway.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">These packages
can all be downloaded by searching in the Download Center at

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that it is
generally not a good idea to try to build a perl with
<small>INST_DRV</small> and <small>INST_TOP</small> set to a
path that already exists from a previous build. In
particular, this may cause problems with the
lib/ExtUtils/t/Embed.t test, which attempts to build a test
program and may end up building against the installed
perl&rsquo;s lib/CORE directory rather than the one being
tested.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">You will have
to make sure that <small>CCTYPE</small> is set correctly and
that <small>CCHOME</small> points to wherever you installed
your compiler.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If building
with the cross-compiler provided by
mingw&minus;w64.sourceforge.net you&rsquo;ll need to

&minus; ie only if the bin folder doesn&rsquo;t contain a
gcc.exe. (The cross-compiler does not provide a gcc.exe,
g++.exe, ar.exe, etc. Instead, all of these executables are
prefixed with

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The default
value for <small>CCHOME</small> in the makefiles for Visual

Type &quot;dmake install&quot; (or &quot;nmake

<tt>&quot;$INST_TOP\$INST_VER\lib\pod&quot;</tt> and
<small>HTML</small> versions of the same under
<tt>&quot;$INST_TOP\$INST_VER\lib\pod\html&quot;</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To use the Perl

<small>PATH</small> environment variable:
<tt>&quot;$INST_TOP\bin&quot;</tt>, e.g.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    set PATH=c:\perl\bin;%PATH%</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you opted to
uncomment <tt>&quot;INST_VER&quot;</tt> and

e.g.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    set PATH=c:\perl\5.6.0\bin;c:\perl\5.6.0\bin\MSWin32&minus;x86;%PATH%</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Usage Hints
for Perl on Windows</b> <br>
Environment Variables</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The installation paths that you
set during the build get compiled into perl, so you
don&rsquo;t have to do anything additional to start using
that perl (except add its location to your
<small>PATH</small> variable).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If you put
extensions in unusual places, you can set
<small>PERL5LIB</small> to a list of paths separated by
semicolons where you want perl to look for libraries. Look
for descriptions of other environment variables you can set
in perlrun.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">You can also
control the shell that perl uses to run <i>system()</i> and
backtick commands via <small>PERL5SHELL</small> . See
perlrun.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Perl does not
depend on the registry, but it can look up certain default
values if you choose to put them there. Perl attempts to
read entries from
<tt>&quot;HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Perl&quot;</tt> and
<tt>&quot;HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Perl&quot;</tt>.
Entries in the former override entries in the latter. One or
more of the following entries (of type <small>REG_SZ</small>
or <small>REG_EXPAND_SZ</small> ) may be set:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    lib&minus;$]              version&minus;specific standard library path to add to @INC
    lib                 standard library path to add to @INC
    sitelib&minus;$]          version&minus;specific site library path to add to @INC
    sitelib             site library path to add to @INC
    vendorlib&minus;$]        version&minus;specific vendor library path to add to @INC
    vendorlib           vendor library path to add to @INC
    PERL*               fallback for all %ENV lookups that begin with &quot;PERL&quot;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note the
<tt>$]</tt> in the above is not literal. Substitute whatever
version of perl you want to honor that entry, e.g.
<tt>5.6.0</tt>. Paths must be separated with semicolons, as
usual on Windows.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">File Globbing</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">By default, perl handles file
globbing using the File::Glob extension, which provides
portable globbing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If you want
perl to use globbing that emulates the quirks of
<small>DOS</small> filename conventions, you might want to
consider using File::DosGlob to override the internal
<i>glob()</i> implementation. See File::DosGlob for
details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Using perl from the command
line</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">If you are accustomed to using
perl from various command-line shells found in
<small>UNIX</small> environments, you will be less than
pleased with what Windows offers by way of a command
shell.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The crucial
thing to understand about the Windows environment is that
the command line you type in is processed twice before Perl
sees it. First, your command shell (usually
<small>CMD</small> .EXE) preprocesses the command line, to
handle redirection, environment variable expansion, and
location of the executable to run. Then, the perl executable
splits the remaining command line into individual arguments,
using the C runtime library upon which Perl was built.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">It is
particularly important to note that neither the shell nor
the C runtime do any wildcard expansions of command-line
arguments (so wildcards need not be quoted). Also, the
quoting behaviours of the shell and the C runtime are
rudimentary at best (and may, if you are using a
non-standard shell, be inconsistent). The only (useful)
quote character is the double quote (&quot;). It can be used
to protect spaces and other special characters in
arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The Windows
documentation describes the shell parsing rules here:
http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en&minus;us/cmd.mspx?mfr=true
&lt;http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/cmd.mspx?mfr=true&gt;
and the C runtime parsing rules here:
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en&minus;us/library/17w5ykft%28v=VS.100%29.aspx
&lt;http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/17w5ykft%28v=VS.100%29.aspx&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Here are some
further observations based on experiments: The C runtime
breaks arguments at spaces and passes them to programs in
argc/argv. Double quotes can be used to prevent arguments
with spaces in them from being split up. You can put a
double quote in an argument by escaping it with a backslash
and enclosing the whole argument within double quotes. The
backslash and the pair of double quotes surrounding the
argument will be stripped by the C runtime.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The file
redirection characters &quot;&lt;&quot;, &quot;&gt;&quot;,
and &quot;|&quot; can be quoted by double quotes (although
there are suggestions that this may not always be true).
Single quotes are not treated as quotes by the shell or the
C runtime, they don&rsquo;t get stripped by the shell (just
to make this type of quoting completely useless). The caret
&quot;^&quot; has also been observed to behave as a quoting
character, but this appears to be a shell feature, and the
caret is not stripped from the command line, so Perl still
sees it (and the C runtime phase does not treat the caret as
a quote character).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Here are some
examples of usage of the &quot;cmd&quot; shell:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This prints two
doublequotes:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    perl &minus;e &quot;print '\&quot;\&quot;' &quot;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This does the
same:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    perl &minus;e &quot;print \&quot;\\\&quot;\\\&quot;\&quot; &quot;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This prints
&quot;bar&quot; and writes &quot;foo&quot; to the file
&quot;blurch&quot;:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    perl &minus;e &quot;print 'foo'; print STDERR 'bar'&quot; &gt; blurch</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This prints
&quot;foo&quot; (&quot;bar&quot; disappears into
nowhereland):</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    perl &minus;e &quot;print 'foo'; print STDERR 'bar'&quot; 2&gt; nul</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This prints
&quot;bar&quot; and writes &quot;foo&quot; into the file
&quot;blurch&quot;:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    perl &minus;e &quot;print 'foo'; print STDERR 'bar'&quot; 1&gt; blurch</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This pipes
&quot;foo&quot; to the &quot;less&quot; pager and prints
&quot;bar&quot; on the console:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    perl &minus;e &quot;print 'foo'; print STDERR 'bar'&quot; | less</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This pipes
&quot;foo\nbar\n&quot; to the less pager:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    perl &minus;le &quot;print 'foo'; print STDERR 'bar'&quot; 2&gt;&amp;1 | less</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This pipes
&quot;foo&quot; to the pager and writes &quot;bar&quot; in

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Discovering the
usefulness of the &quot;command.com&quot; shell on Windows
9x is left as an exercise to the reader :)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">One
particularly pernicious problem with the 4NT command shell
for Windows is that it (nearly) always treats a % character
as indicating that environment variable expansion is needed.
Under this shell, it is therefore important to always double
any % characters which you want Perl to see (for example,
for hash variables), even when they are quoted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Building Extensions</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The Comprehensive Perl Archive
Network ( <small>CPAN</small> ) offers a wealth of
extensions, some of which require a C compiler to build.
Look in &lt;http://www.cpan.org/&gt; for more information on
<small>CPAN</small> .</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that not
all of the extensions available from <small>CPAN</small> may
work in the Windows environment; you should check the
information at &lt;http://testers.cpan.org/&gt; before
investing too much effort into porting modules that
don&rsquo;t readily build.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Most extensions
(whether they require a C compiler or not) can be built,
tested and installed with the standard mantra:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    perl Makefile.PL
    $MAKE
    $MAKE test
    $MAKE install</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">where
<tt>$MAKE</tt> is whatever &rsquo;make&rsquo; program you
have configured perl to use. Use &quot;perl
&minus;V:make&quot; to find out what this is. Some
extensions may not provide a testsuite (so &quot;$MAKE
test&quot; may not do anything or fail), but most serious
ones do.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">It is important
that you use a supported &rsquo;make&rsquo; program, and
ensure Config.pm knows about it. If you don&rsquo;t have
nmake, you can either get dmake from the location mentioned
earlier or get an old version of nmake reportedly available
from:</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">http://download.microsoft.com/download/vc15/Patch/1.52/W95/EN&minus;US/nmake15.exe
&lt;http://download.microsoft.com/download/vc15/Patch/1.52/W95/EN-US/nmake15.exe&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Another option
is to use the make written in Perl, available from
<small>CPAN</small> .</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">http://www.cpan.org/modules/by&minus;module/Make/
&lt;http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/Make/&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">You may also
use dmake. See &quot;Make&quot; above on how to get it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
MakeMaker actually emits makefiles with different syntax
depending on what &rsquo;make&rsquo; it thinks you are
using. Therefore, it is important that one of the following
values appears in Config.pm:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">    make='nmake'        # MakeMaker emits nmake syntax
    make='dmake'        # MakeMaker emits dmake syntax
    any other value     # MakeMaker emits generic make syntax
                            (e.g GNU make, or Perl make)</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If the value
doesn&rsquo;t match the &rsquo;make&rsquo; program you want
to use, edit Config.pm to fix it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If a module
implements XSUBs, you will need one of the supported C
compilers. You must make sure you have set up the
environment for the compiler for command-line
compilation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If a module
does not build for some reason, look carefully for why it
failed, and report problems to the module author. If it
looks like the extension building support is at fault,
report that with full details of how the build failed using
the perlbug utility.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Command-line Wildcard
Expansion</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The default command shells on
<small>DOS</small> descendant operating systems (such as
they are) usually do not expand wildcard arguments supplied
to programs. They consider it the application&rsquo;s job to
handle that. This is commonly achieved by linking the
application (in our case, perl) with startup code that the C
runtime libraries usually provide. However, doing that
results in incompatible perl versions (since the behavior of
the argv expansion code differs depending on the compiler,
and it is even buggy on some compilers). Besides, it may be
a source of frustration if you use such a perl binary with
an alternate shell that *does* expand wildcards.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Instead, the
following solution works rather well. The nice things about
it are 1) you can start using it right away; 2) it is more
powerful, because it will do the right thing with a pattern
like */*/*.c; 3) you can decide whether you do/don&rsquo;t
want to use it; and 4) you can extend the method to add any
customizations (or even entirely different kinds of wildcard
expansion).</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">        C:\&gt; copy con c:\perl\lib\Wild.pm
        # Wild.pm &minus; emulate shell @ARGV expansion on shells that don't
        use File::DosGlob;
        @ARGV = map {
                      my @g = File::DosGlob::glob($_) if /[*?]/;
                      @g ? @g : $_;
                    } @ARGV;
        1;
        ^Z
        C:\&gt; set PERL5OPT=&minus;MWild
        C:\&gt; perl &minus;le &quot;for (@ARGV) { print }&quot; */*/perl*.c
        p4view/perl/perl.c
        p4view/perl/perlio.c
        p4view/perl/perly.c
        perl5.005/win32/perlglob.c
        perl5.005/win32/perllib.c
        perl5.005/win32/perlglob.c
        perl5.005/win32/perllib.c
        perl5.005/win32/perlglob.c
        perl5.005/win32/perllib.c</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note there are
two distinct steps there: 1) You&rsquo;ll have to create
Wild.pm and put it in your perl lib directory. 2)
You&rsquo;ll need to set the <small>PERL5OPT</small>
environment variable. If you want argv expansion to be the
default, just set <small>PERL5OPT</small> in your default
startup environment.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If you are
using the Visual C compiler, you can get the C
runtime&rsquo;s command line wildcard expansion built into
perl binary. The resulting binary will always expand
unquoted command lines, which may not be what you want if
you use a shell that does that for you. The expansion done
is also somewhat less powerful than the approach suggested
above.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Notes on 64&minus;bit
Windows</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Windows .NET Server supports
the <small>LLP64</small> data model on the Intel Itanium
architecture.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The
<small>LLP64</small> data model is different from the
<small>LP64</small> data model that is the norm on
64&minus;bit Unix platforms. In the former,
<tt>&quot;int&quot;</tt> and <tt>&quot;long&quot;</tt> are
both 32&minus;bit data types, while pointers are 64 bits
wide. In addition, there is a separate 64&minus;bit wide
integral type, <tt>&quot;__int64&quot;</tt>. In contrast,
the <small>LP64</small> data model that is pervasive on Unix
platforms provides <tt>&quot;int&quot;</tt> as the
32&minus;bit type, while both the <tt>&quot;long&quot;</tt>
type and pointers are of 64&minus;bit precision. Note that
both models provide for 64&minus;bits of addressability.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">64&minus;bit
Windows running on Itanium is capable of running
32&minus;bit x86 binaries transparently. This means that you
could use a 32&minus;bit build of Perl on a 64&minus;bit
system. Given this, why would one want to build a
64&minus;bit build of Perl? Here are some reasons why you
would bother:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Running Perl
Scripts</b> <br>
Perl scripts on <small>UNIX</small> use the &quot;#!&quot;
(a.k.a &quot;shebang&quot;) line to indicate to the
<small>OS</small> that it should execute the file using
perl. Windows has no comparable means to indicate arbitrary
files are executables.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Instead, all
available methods to execute plain text files on Windows
rely on the file &quot;extension&quot;. There are three
methods to use this to execute perl scripts:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is a facility called
&quot;file extension associations&quot;. This can be
manipulated via the two commands &quot;assoc&quot; and

<p>Since file associations don&rsquo;t work everywhere, and
there are reportedly bugs with file associations where it
does work, the old method of wrapping the perl script to
make it look like a regular batch file to the
<small>OS</small> , may be used. The install process makes
available the &quot;pl2bat.bat&quot; script which can be
used to wrap perl scripts into batch files. For example:</p></td></tr>

in batch files. As of this writing, 4DOS/NT users will need
a &quot;ParameterChar = *&quot; statement in their 4NT.INI
file or will need to execute &quot;setdos /p*&quot; in the
4DOS/NT startup file to enable this to work.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using &quot;pl2bat&quot; has a
few problems: the file name gets changed, so scripts that

properly; running &quot;pl2bat&quot; replicates the contents
of the original script, and so this process can be
maintenance intensive if the originals get updated often. A
different approach that avoids both problems is
possible.</p> </td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">A script called
&quot;runperl.bat&quot; is available that can be copied to
any filename (along with the .bat suffix). For example, if
you call it &quot;foo.bat&quot;, it will run the file
&quot;foo&quot; when it is executed. Since you can run batch
files on Windows platforms simply by typing the name
(without the extension), this effectively runs the file
&quot;foo&quot;, when you type either &quot;foo&quot; or
&quot;foo.bat&quot;. With this method, &quot;foo.bat&quot;
can even be in a different location than the file
&quot;foo&quot;, as long as &quot;foo&quot; is available
somewhere on the <small>PATH</small> . If your scripts are
on a filesystem that allows symbolic links, you can even
avoid copying &quot;runperl.bat&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">Here&rsquo;s a
diversion: copy &quot;runperl.bat&quot; to
&quot;runperl&quot;, and type &quot;runperl&quot;. Explain
the observed behavior, or lack thereof. :) Hint: .gnidnats

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Miscellaneous
Things</b> <br>
A full set of <small>HTML</small> documentation is
installed, so you should be able to use it if you have a web
browser installed on your system.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><tt>&quot;perldoc&quot;</tt>
is also a useful tool for browsing information contained in
the documentation, especially in conjunction with a pager
like <tt>&quot;less&quot;</tt> (recent versions of which
have Windows support). You may have to set the
<small>PAGER</small> environment variable to use a specific
pager. &quot;perldoc &minus;f foo&quot; will print
information about the perl operator &quot;foo&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">One common
mistake when using this port with a <small>GUI</small>
library like <tt>&quot;Tk&quot;</tt> is assuming that
Perl&rsquo;s normal behavior of opening a command-line
window will go away. This isn&rsquo;t the case. If you want
to start a copy of <tt>&quot;perl&quot;</tt> without opening
a command-line window, use the <tt>&quot;wperl&quot;</tt>
executable built during the installation process. Usage is
exactly the same as normal <tt>&quot;perl&quot;</tt> on
Windows, except that options like
<tt>&quot;&minus;h&quot;</tt> don&rsquo;t work (since they
need a command-line window to print to).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you find
bugs in perl, you can run <tt>&quot;perlbug&quot;</tt> to
create a bug report (you may have to send it manually if
<tt>&quot;perlbug&quot;</tt> cannot find a mailer on your
system).</p>

</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Norton
AntiVirus interferes with the build process, particularly if
set to &quot;AutoProtect, All Files, when Opened&quot;.
Unlike large applications the perl build process opens and
modifies a lot of files. Having the the AntiVirus scan each
and every one slows build the process significantly. Worse,
with PERLIO=stdio the build process fails with peculiar
messages as the virus checker interacts badly with
miniperl.exe writing configure files (it seems to either
catch file part written and treat it as suspicious, or virus
checker may have it &quot;locked&quot; in a way which
inhibits miniperl updating it). The build does complete
with</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">   set PERLIO=perlio</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">but that may be
just luck. Other AntiVirus software may have similar
issues.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Some of the
built-in functions do not act exactly as documented in
perlfunc, and a few are not implemented at all. To avoid
surprises, particularly if you have had prior exposure to
Perl in other operating environments or if you intend to
write code that will be portable to other environments, see
perlport for a reasonably definitive list of these
differences.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Not all
extensions available from <small>CPAN</small> may build or
work properly in the Windows environment. See &quot;Building
Extensions&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Most
<tt>&quot;socket()&quot;</tt> related calls are supported,
but they may not behave as on Unix platforms. See perlport
for the full list.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Signal handling
may not behave as on Unix platforms (where it doesn&rsquo;t
exactly &quot;behave&quot;, either :). For instance, calling
<tt>&quot;die()&quot;</tt> or <tt>&quot;exit()&quot;</tt>
from signal handlers will cause an exception, since most
implementations of <tt>&quot;signal()&quot;</tt> on Windows
are severely crippled. Thus, signals may work only for
simple things like setting a flag variable in the handler.
Using signals under this port should currently be considered
unsupported.</p>

</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This port was
originally contributed by Gary Ng around 5.003_24, and
borrowed from the Hip Communications port that was available
at the time. Various people have made numerous and sundry
hacks since then.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">GCC/mingw32
support was added in 5.005 (Nick Ing-Simmons).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Support for
<small>PERL_OBJECT</small> was added in 5.005 (ActiveState
Tool Corp).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Support for
<i>fork()</i> emulation was added in 5.6 (ActiveState Tool
Corp).</p>
