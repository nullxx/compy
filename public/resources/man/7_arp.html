<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">arp &minus;
Linux ARP kernel module.</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This kernel
protocol module implements the Address Resolution Protocol
defined in RFC&nbsp;826. It is used to convert between
Layer2 hardware addresses and IPv4 protocol addresses on
directly connected networks. The user normally doesn&rsquo;t
interact directly with this module except to configure it;
instead it provides a service for other protocols in the
kernel.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A user process
can receive ARP packets by using <b>packet</b>(7) sockets.
There is also a mechanism for managing the ARP cache in
user-space by using <b>netlink</b>(7) sockets. The ARP table
can also be controlled via <b>ioctl</b>(2) on any
<b>AF_INET</b> socket.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The ARP module
maintains a cache of mappings between hardware addresses and
protocol addresses. The cache has a limited size so old and
less frequently used entries are garbage-collected. Entries
which are marked as permanent are never deleted by the
garbage-collector. The cache can be directly manipulated by
the use of ioctls and its behavior can be tuned by the
<i>/proc</i> interfaces described below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When there is
no positive feedback for an existing mapping after some time
(see the <i>/proc</i> interfaces below), a neighbor cache
entry is considered stale. Positive feedback can be gotten
from a higher layer; for example from a successful TCP ACK.
Other protocols can signal forward progress using the
<b>MSG_CONFIRM</b> flag to <b>sendmsg</b>(2). When there is
no forward progress, ARP tries to reprobe. It first tries to
ask a local arp daemon <b>app_solicit</b> times for an
updated MAC address. If that fails and an old MAC address is
known, a unicast probe is sent <b>ucast_solicit</b> times.
If that fails too, it will broadcast a new ARP request to
the network. Requests are sent only when there is data
queued for sending.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Linux will
automatically add a nonpermanent proxy arp entry when it
receives a request for an address it forwards to and proxy
arp is enabled on the receiving interface. When there is a
reject route for the target, no proxy arp entry is
added.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Ioctls</b>
<br>
Three ioctls are available on all <b>AF_INET</b> sockets.
They take a pointer to a <i>struct arpreq</i> as their
argument.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">struct arpreq {
<br>
struct sockaddr arp_pa; /* protocol address */ <br>
struct sockaddr arp_ha; /* hardware address */ <br>
int arp_flags; /* flags */ <br>
struct sockaddr arp_netmask; /* netmask of protocol address
*/ <br>
char arp_dev[16]; <br>
};</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>SIOCSARP</b>,
<b>SIOCDARP</b> and <b>SIOCGARP</b> respectively set, delete
and get an ARP mapping. Setting and deleting ARP maps are
privileged operations and may be performed only by a process
with the <b>CAP_NET_ADMIN</b> capability or an effective UID
of 0.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>arp_pa</i>
must be an <b>AF_INET</b> address and <i>arp_ha</i> must
have the same type as the device which is specified in
<i>arp_dev</i>. <i>arp_dev</i> is a zero-terminated string
which names a device.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the
<b>ATF_NETMASK</b> flag is set, then <i>arp_netmask</i>
should be valid. Linux 2.2 does not support proxy network
ARP entries, so this should be set to 0xffffffff, or 0 to
remove an existing proxy arp entry. <b>ATF_USETRAILERS</b>
is obsolete and should not be used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>/proc
interfaces</b> <br>
ARP supports a range of <i>/proc</i> interfaces to configure
parameters on a global or per-interface basis. The
interfaces can be accessed by reading or writing the
<i>/proc/sys/net/ipv4/neigh/*/*</i> files. Each interface in
the system has its own directory in
<i>/proc/sys/net/ipv4/neigh/</i>. The setting in the
&quot;default&quot; directory is used for all newly created
devices. Unless otherwise specified, time-related interfaces
are specified in seconds. <i><br>
anycast_delay</i> (since Linux 2.2)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The maximum number of jiffies
to delay before replying to a IPv6 neighbor solicitation
message. Anycast support is not yet implemented. Defaults to
1 second.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>app_solicit</i> (since Linux
2.2)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The maximum number of probes to
send to the user space ARP daemon via netlink before
dropping back to multicast probes (see
<i>mcast_solicit</i>). Defaults to 0.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>base_reachable_time</i>
(since Linux 2.2)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Once a neighbor has been found,
the entry is considered to be valid for at least a random
value between <i>base_reachable_time</i>/2 and
3*<i>base_reachable_time</i>/2. An entry&rsquo;s validity
will be extended if it receives positive feedback from
higher level protocols. Defaults to 30 seconds. This file is
now obsolete in favor of <i>base_reachable_time_ms</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>base_reachable_time_ms</i>
(since Linux 2.6.12)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">As for
<i>base_reachable_time</i>, but measures time in
milliseconds. Defaults to 30000 milliseconds.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>delay_first_probe_time</i>
(since Linux 2.2)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Delay before first probe after
it has been decided that a neighbor is stale. Defaults to 5
seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>gc_interval</i> (since Linux
2.2)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">How frequently the garbage
collector for neighbor entries should attempt to run.
Defaults to 30 seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>gc_stale_time</i> (since
Linux 2.2)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Determines how often to check
for stale neighbor entries. When a neighbor entry is
considered stale, it is resolved again before sending data
to it. Defaults to 60 seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>gc_thresh1</i> (since Linux
2.2)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The minimum number of entries
to keep in the ARP cache. The garbage collector will not run
if there are fewer than this number of entries in the cache.
Defaults to 128.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>gc_thresh2</i> (since Linux
2.2)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The soft maximum number of
entries to keep in the ARP cache. The garbage collector will
allow the number of entries to exceed this for 5 seconds
before collection will be performed. Defaults to 512.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>gc_thresh3</i> (since Linux
2.2)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The hard maximum number of
entries to keep in the ARP cache. The garbage collector will
always run if there are more than this number of entries in
the cache. Defaults to 1024.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>locktime</i> (since Linux
2.2)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The minimum number of jiffies
to keep an ARP entry in the cache. This prevents ARP cache
thrashing if there is more than one potential mapping
(generally due to network misconfiguration). Defaults to 1
second.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>mcast_solicit</i> (since
Linux 2.2)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The maximum number of attempts
to resolve an address by multicast/broadcast before marking
the entry as unreachable. Defaults to 3.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>proxy_delay</i> (since Linux
2.2)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">When an ARP request for a known
proxy-ARP address is received, delay up to
<i>proxy_delay</i> jiffies before replying. This is used to
prevent network flooding in some cases. Defaults to 0.8
seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>proxy_qlen</i> (since Linux
2.2)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The maximum number of packets
which may be queued to proxy-ARP addresses. Defaults to
64.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>retrans_time</i> (since
Linux 2.2)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The number of jiffies to delay
before retransmitting a request. Defaults to 1 second. This
file is now obsolete in favor of <i>retrans_time_ms</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>retrans_time_ms</i> (since
Linux 2.6.12)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The number of milliseconds to
delay before retransmitting a request. Defaults to 1000
milliseconds.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>ucast_solicit</i> (since
Linux 2.2)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The maximum number of attempts
to send unicast probes before asking the ARP daemon (see
<i>app_solicit</i>). Defaults to 3.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>unres_qlen</i> (since Linux
2.2)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The maximum number of packets
which may be queued for each unresolved address by other
network layers. Defaults to 3.</p>

<h2>VERSIONS
<a name="VERSIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The <i>struct
arpreq</i> changed in Linux 2.0 to include the
<i>arp_dev</i> member and the ioctl numbers changed at the
same time. Support for the old ioctls was dropped in Linux
2.2.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Support for
proxy arp entries for networks (netmask not equal
0xffffffff) was dropped in Linux 2.2. It is replaced by
automatic proxy arp setup by the kernel for all reachable
hosts on other interfaces (when forwarding and proxy arp is
enabled for the interface).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>neigh/*</i> interfaces did not exist before Linux
2.2.</p>

<h2>BUGS
<a name="BUGS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Some timer
settings are specified in jiffies, which is architecture-
and kernel version-dependent; see <b>time</b>(7).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There is no way
to signal positive feedback from user space. This means
connection-oriented protocols implemented in user space will
generate excessive ARP traffic, because ndisc will regularly
reprobe the MAC address. The same problem applies for some
kernel protocols (e.g., NFS over UDP).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This man page
mashes IPv4 specific and shared between IPv4 and IPv6
functionality together.</p>
