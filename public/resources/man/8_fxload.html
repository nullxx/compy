<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>fxload</b>
is a program which downloads firmware to USB devices based
on AnchorChips EZ-USB, Cypress EZ-USB FX, or Cypress EZ-USB
FX2 microcontrollers. These have 8-bit 8051 cores with
special extensions for USB I/O. The FX2 supports high speed
USB 2.0 transfers (480 Mbit/sec) as well as full speed USB
1.1 transfers (12 Mbit/sec), while the earlier parts
supports only full speed transfers. These controllers have
several package options, and can be set up with external
memory (on-chip memory is usually about 8K), EEPROMs, and
ROMs when device costs allow.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This uses
&quot;usbfs&quot; (older name: &quot;usbdevfs&quot;) to
access devices, and issues vendor specific control requests
to download and reset the EZ-USB devices. Normally, firmware
will then &quot;renumerate&quot; by disconnecting from USB
and then reconnecting as a new device. It then appears with
new device descriptors and functionality, as provided by the
firmware which has been downloaded.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To support some
non-firmware applications, this can also set up symbolic
links for those usbfs names. It can also change their access
modes. Both of these can help simplify software applications
that need to talk to USB devices using user mode drivers,
don&rsquo;t want to run with privileges or to examine all of
the existing USB devices, and which don&rsquo;t need more
kernel drivers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">See the
<i>Linux-Hotplug</i> web site for information about how to
use <b>fxload</b> to download device firmware when
hotplugging USB devices, using driver-specific scripts
stored in the <i>/etc/hotplug/usb</i> directory.</p>

<h2>FUNCTION LETTERS
<a name="FUNCTION LETTERS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">At least one of
the following options must be specified. Note that as usual
with UNIX and Linux commands, the order of command option
flags does not matter. You may use these in any order.
<b><br>
&minus;I</b> <i>hexfile</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Downloads the specified
firmware file. This firmware is provided in standard Intel
hexfile format. (Common naming conventions include
<i>*.hex</i> and <i>*.ihx</i>.) Depending on the device and
firmware in use, the <b>&minus;s</b> option may also be
necessary to specify a second stage loader. Firmware is
normally downloaded to RAM and executed, but there is also
an option for downloading into bootable I2C EEPROMs.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;L</b> <i>link</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Creates the specified symbolic
link to the usbfs device path. This would typically be used
to create a name in a directory that would be searched by an
application. The symlink would be removed by some other
component on device unplug.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;m</b> <i>mode</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Changes permissions on the
&quot;usbfs&quot; device node. By default, those nodes are
only accessible by privileged users, which doesn&rsquo;t
help when the user mode device driver needs to run without
root privileges. Note that usbfs mount options like
<i>devmode=0666</i> are also available.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that when
downloading firmware that renumerates, there&rsquo;s no
point in changing the device permissions or creating a
symbolic link.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">By default,
<b>fxload</b> assumes the device uses an EZ-USB or EZ-USB
FX. It also assumes that the device in question has been
specified by USB kernel hotplugging conventions, using the
<i>DEVICE</i> environment variable to name a
&quot;usbfs&quot; file that can be used to talk to the
device. <b><br>
&minus;c</b> <i>config</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Indicates the specified
firmware should be downloaded to an I2C boot EEPROM rather
than to RAM. The parameter is the EZ-USB FX or FX2
configuration byte, and for AnchorChips devices the value
should be zero. This requires a second stage loader that
knows how to write to I2C EEPROMs specified using the
<b>&minus;s</b> option, as well as a device that&rsquo;s
provided with an EEPROM large enough to store the boot
firmware. After downloading to a device&rsquo;s EEPROM, you
should retest it starting from power off.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;s</b>
<i>loader</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This identifies the hex file
holding a second stage loader (in the same hex file format
as the firmware itself), which is loaded into internal
memory. This loader understands additional vendor control
requests, beyond the one built into all EZ-USB hardware,
which are needed to write external RAM or EEPROM. As a last
step when loading firmware, <b>fxload</b> normally
overwrites this second stage loader with parts of the
firmware residing on-chip.</p>

</td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;t</b> <i>type</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Indicates which type of
microcontroller is used in the device; type may be one of
<i>an21</i> (the original AnchorChips devices), <i>fx</i>
(Cypress&rsquo; updated version, the EZ-USB FX), or
<i>fx2</i> (the Cypress EZ-USB FX2, supporting high speed
transfers). Except when writing to EEPROM, all that normally
matters when downloading firmware is whether or not the
device uses an FX2.</p>

<td width="78%">


<p>Prints some diagnostics, such as download addresses and
sizes, to standard error. Repeat the flag (<b>-vv</b>,
<b>-vvv</b>) to get more diagnostics.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;D</b>
<i>devpath</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specifies the &quot;usbfs&quot;
path name for the device in question, such as
<i>/proc/bus/usb/004/080</i>. This takes precedence over any
<i>DEVICE</i> environment variable that may be set.</p>

<h2>NOTES
<a name="NOTES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This program
implements one extension to the standard &quot;hex
file&quot; format. Lines beginning with a &quot;#&quot;
character are ignored, and may be used to hold copyright
statements and other information. Other tools may not handle
hexfiles using this extension.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">At this
writing, &quot;usbfs&quot; is a kernel configuration option.
That means that device drivers relying on user mode firmware
downloading may need to depend on that kernel configuration
option. A less preferable alternative involves compiling the
firmware into the kernel and managing downloads and
renumeration there. This is less preferable in part because
much device firmware is provided with GPL-incompatible
licensing, and in part because storing such firmware
firmware wastes kernel memory.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For EZ-USB
family devices, the hardware&rsquo;s first stage loader
(supporting the 0xA0 vendor request) can&rsquo;t write into
external memory. Configurations that put firmware into
external memory thus need a second stage loader. For typical
&quot;flat&quot; memory architectures, a loader supporting
the 0xA3 vendor request is used to write into that memory.
Similarly, a second stage loader that supports the 0xA2
vendor request is needed when writing boot firmware into an
I2C EEPROM. These 0xA2 and 0xA3 vendor commands are
conventions defined by Cypress. Devices that use bank
switching or similar mechanisms to stretch the 64KByte
address space may need different approach to loading
firmware.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Not all devices
support EEPROM updates. Some EZ-USB based devices
don&rsquo;t have an I2C EEPROM; many such EEPROMs are too
small to store firmware; and some firmware can&rsquo;t be
placed in bootable I2C EEPROMs.</p>
