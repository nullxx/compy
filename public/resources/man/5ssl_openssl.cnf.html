<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">config &minus;
OpenSSL CONF library configuration files</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The OpenSSL
<small>CONF</small> library can be used to read
configuration files. It is used for the OpenSSL master
configuration file <b>openssl.cnf</b> and in a few other
places like <b><small>SPKAC</small></b> files and
certificate extension files for the <b>x509</b> utility.
OpenSSL applications can also use the <small>CONF</small>
library for their own purposes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A configuration
file is divided into a number of sections. Each section
starts with a line <b>[ section_name ]</b> and ends when a
new section is started or end of file is reached. A section
name can consist of alphanumeric characters and
underscores.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The first
section of a configuration file is special and is referred
to as the <b>default</b> section this is usually unnamed and
is from the start of file until the first named section.
When a name is being looked up it is first looked up in a
named section (if any) and then the default section.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The environment
is mapped onto a section called <b><small>ENV</small></b>
.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Comments can be
included by preceding them with the <b>#</b> character</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Each section in
a configuration file consists of a number of name and value
pairs of the form <b>name=value</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The <b>name</b>
string can contain any alphanumeric characters as well as a
few punctuation symbols such as <b>. , ;</b> and
<b>_</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>value</b> string consists of the string following the
<b>=</b> character until end of line with any leading and
trailing white space removed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The value
string undergoes variable expansion. This can be done by
including the form <b>$var</b> or <b>${var}</b>: this will
substitute the value of the named variable in the current
section. It is also possible to substitute a value from
another section using the syntax <b>$section::name</b> or
<b>${section::name}</b>. By using the form <b>$ENV::name</b>
environment variables can be substituted. It is also
possible to assign values to environment variables by using
the name <b>ENV::name</b>, this will work if the program
looks up environment variables using the
<b><small>CONF</small></b> library instead of calling
<b><i>getenv()</i></b> directly.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is possible
to escape certain characters by using any kind of quote or
the <b>\</b> character. By making the last character of a
line a <b>\</b> a <b>value</b> string can be spread across
multiple lines. In addition the sequences <b>\n</b>,
<b>\r</b>, <b>\b</b> and <b>\t</b> are recognized.</p>

<h2>OPENSSL LIBRARY CONFIGURATION
<a name="OPENSSL LIBRARY CONFIGURATION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In OpenSSL
0.9.7 and later applications can automatically configure
certain aspects of OpenSSL using the master OpenSSL
configuration file, or optionally an alternative
configuration file. The <b>openssl</b> utility includes this
functionality: any sub command uses the master OpenSSL
configuration file unless an option is used in the sub
command to use an alternative configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To enable
library configuration the default section needs to contain
an appropriate line which points to the main configuration
section. The default name is <b>openssl_conf</b> which is
used by the <b>openssl</b> utility. Other applications may
use an alternative name such as
<b>myapplicaton_conf</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
configuration section should consist of a set of name value
pairs which contain specific module configuration
information. The <b>name</b> represents the name of the
<i>configuration module</i> the meaning of the <b>value</b>
is module specific: it may, for example, represent a further
configuration section containing configuration module
specific information. E.g.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"> openssl_conf = openssl_init
 [openssl_init]
 oid_section = new_oids
 engines = engine_section
 [new_oids]
 ... new oids here ...
 [engine_section]
 ... engine stuff here ...</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Currently there
are two configuration modules. One for <small>ASN1</small>
objects another for <small>ENGINE</small> configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b><small>ASN1
OBJECT CONFIGURATION MODULE</small></b> <br>
This module has the name <b>oid_section</b>. The value of
this variable points to a section containing name value
pairs of OIDs: the name is the <small>OID</small> short and
long name, the value is the numerical form of the
<small>OID.</small> Although some of the <b>openssl</b>
utility sub commands already have their own <small>ASN1
OBJECT</small> section functionality not all do. By using
the <small>ASN1 OBJECT</small> configuration module
<b>all</b> the <b>openssl</b> utility sub commands can see
the new objects as well as any compliant applications. For
example:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"> [new_oids]
 some_new_oid = 1.2.3.4
 some_other_oid = 1.2.3.5</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In OpenSSL
0.9.8 it is also possible to set the value to the long name
followed by a comma and the numerical <small>OID</small>
form. For example:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"> shortName = some object long name, 1.2.3.4</pre>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b><small>ENGINE
CONFIGURATION MODULE</small></b> <br>
This <small>ENGINE</small> configuration module has the name
<b>engines</b>. The value of this variable points to a
section containing further <small>ENGINE</small>
configuration information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The section
pointed to by <b>engines</b> is a table of engine names
(though see <b>engine_id</b> below) and further sections
containing configuration informations specific to each
<small>ENGINE.</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Each
<small>ENGINE</small> specific section is used to set
default algorithms, load dynamic, perform initialization and
send ctrls. The actual operation performed depends on the
<i>command</i> name which is the name of the name value
pair. The currently supported commands are listed below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For
example:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"> [engine_section]
 # Configure ENGINE named &quot;foo&quot;
 foo = foo_section
 # Configure ENGINE named &quot;bar&quot;
 bar = bar_section
 [foo_section]
 ... foo ENGINE specific commands ...
 [bar_section]
 ... &quot;bar&quot; ENGINE specific commands ...</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The command
<b>engine_id</b> is used to give the <small>ENGINE</small>
name. If used this command must be first. For example:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"> [engine_section]
 # This would normally handle an ENGINE named &quot;foo&quot;
 foo = foo_section
 [foo_section]
 # Override default name and use &quot;myfoo&quot; instead.
 engine_id = myfoo</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The command
<b>dynamic_path</b> loads and adds an <small>ENGINE</small>
from the given path. It is equivalent to sending the ctrls
<b><small>SO_PATH</small></b> with the path argument
followed by <b><small>LIST_ADD</small></b> with value 2 and
<b><small>LOAD</small></b> to the dynamic
<small>ENGINE.</small> If this is not the required behaviour
then alternative ctrls can be sent directly to the dynamic
<small>ENGINE</small> using ctrl commands.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The command
<b>init</b> determines whether to initialize the
<small>ENGINE.</small> If the value is <b>0</b> the
<small>ENGINE</small> will not be initialized, if <b>1</b>
and attempt it made to initialized the <small>ENGINE</small>
immediately. If the <b>init</b> command is not present then
an attempt will be made to initialize the
<small>ENGINE</small> after all commands in its section have
been processed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The command
<b>default_algorithms</b> sets the default algorithms an
<small>ENGINE</small> will supply using the functions
<b><i>ENGINE_set_default_string()</i></b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the name
matches none of the above command names it is assumed to be
a ctrl command which is sent to the <small>ENGINE.</small>
The value of the command is the argument to the ctrl
command. If the value is the string
<b><small>EMPTY</small></b> then no value is sent to the
command.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For
example:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"> [engine_section]
 # Configure ENGINE named &quot;foo&quot;
 foo = foo_section
 [foo_section]
 # Load engine from DSO
 dynamic_path = /some/path/fooengine.so
 # A foo specific ctrl.
 some_ctrl = some_value
 # Another ctrl that doesn't take a value.
 other_ctrl = EMPTY
 # Supply all default algorithms
 default_algorithms = ALL</pre>


<h2>NOTES
<a name="NOTES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If a
configuration file attempts to expand a variable that
doesn&rsquo;t exist then an error is flagged and the file
will not load. This can happen if an attempt is made to
expand an environment variable that doesn&rsquo;t exist. For
example in a previous version of OpenSSL the default OpenSSL
master configuration file used the value of
<b><small>HOME</small></b> which may not be defined on non
Unix systems and would cause an error.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This can be
worked around by including a <b>default</b> section to
provide a default value: then if the environment lookup
fails the default value will be used instead. For this to
work properly the default value must be defined earlier in
the configuration file than the expansion. See the
<b><small>EXAMPLES</small></b> section for an example of how
to do this.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the same
variable exists in the same section then all but the last
value will be silently ignored. In certain circumstances
such as with DNs the same field may occur multiple times.
This is usually worked around by ignoring any characters
before an initial <b>.</b> e.g.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"> 1.OU=&quot;My first OU&quot;
 2.OU=&quot;My Second OU&quot;</pre>


<h2>EXAMPLES
<a name="EXAMPLES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Here is a
sample configuration file using some of the features
mentioned above.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"> # This is the default section.
 HOME=/temp
 RANDFILE= ${ENV::HOME}/.rnd
 configdir=$ENV::HOME/config
 [ section_one ]
 # We are now in section one.
 # Quotes permit leading and trailing whitespace
 any = &quot; any variable name &quot;
 other = A string that can \
 cover several lines \
 by including \\ characters
 message = Hello World\n
 [ section_two ]
 greeting = $section_one::message</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This next
example shows how to expand environment variables
safely.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Suppose you
want a variable called <b>tmpfile</b> to refer to a
temporary filename. The directory it is placed in can
determined by the the <b><small>TEMP</small></b> or
<b><small>TMP</small></b> environment variables but they may
not be set to any value at all. If you just include the
environment variable names and the variable doesn&rsquo;t
exist then this will cause an error when an attempt is made
to load the configuration file. By making use of the default
section both values can be looked up with
<b><small>TEMP</small></b> taking priority and <b>/tmp</b>
used if neither is defined:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"> TMP=/tmp
 # The above value is used if TMP isn't in the environment
 TEMP=$ENV::TMP
 # The above value is used if TEMP isn't in the environment
 tmpfile=${ENV::TEMP}/tmp.filename</pre>


<h2>BUGS
<a name="BUGS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Currently there
is no way to include characters using the octal <b>\nnn</b>
form. Strings are all null terminated so nulls cannot form
part of the value.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The escaping
isn&rsquo;t quite right: if you want to use sequences like
<b>\n</b> you can&rsquo;t use any quote escaping on the same
line.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Files are
loaded in a single pass. This means that an variable
expansion will only work if the variables referenced are
defined earlier in the file.</p>
