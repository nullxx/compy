<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Unicode &minus;
universal character set</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
international standard <b>ISO 10646</b> defines the
<b>Universal Character Set (UCS)</b>. UCS contains all
characters of all other character set standards. It also
guarantees <b>round-trip compatibility</b>, i.e., conversion
tables can be built such that no information is lost when a
string is converted from any other encoding to UCS and
back.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">UCS contains
the characters required to represent practically all known
languages. This includes not only the Latin, Greek,
Cyrillic, Hebrew, Arabic, Armenian, and Georgian scripts,
but also Chinese, Japanese and Korean Han ideographs as well
as scripts such as Hiragana, Katakana, Hangul, Devanagari,
Bengali, Gurmukhi, Gujarati, Oriya, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada,
Malayalam, Thai, Lao, Khmer, Bopomofo, Tibetan, Runic,
Ethiopic, Canadian Syllabics, Cherokee, Mongolian, Ogham,
Myanmar, Sinhala, Thaana, Yi, and others. For scripts not
yet covered, research on how to best encode them for
computer usage is still going on and they will be added
eventually. This might eventually include not only
Hieroglyphs and various historic Indo-European languages,
but even some selected artistic scripts such as Tengwar,
Cirth, and Klingon. UCS also covers a large number of
graphical, typographical, mathematical and scientific
symbols, including those provided by TeX, Postscript, APL,
MS-DOS, MS-Windows, Macintosh, OCR fonts, as well as many
word processing and publishing systems, and more are being
added.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The UCS
standard (ISO 10646) describes a <i>31-bit character set
architecture</i> consisting of 128 24-bit <i>groups</i>,
each divided into 256 16-bit <i>planes</i> made up of 256
8-bit <i>rows</i> with 256 <i>column</i> positions, one for
each character. Part 1 of the standard (<b>ISO 10646-1</b>)
defines the first 65534 code positions (0x0000 to 0xfffd),
which form the <i>Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP)</i>, that
is plane 0 in group 0. Part 2 of the standard (<b>ISO
10646-2</b>) adds characters to group 0 outside the BMP in
several <i>supplementary planes</i> in the range 0x10000 to
0x10ffff. There are no plans to add characters beyond
0x10ffff to the standard, therefore of the entire code
space, only a small fraction of group 0 will ever be
actually used in the foreseeable future. The BMP contains
all characters found in the commonly used other character
sets. The supplemental planes added by ISO 10646-2 cover
only more exotic characters for special scientific,
dictionary printing, publishing industry, higher-level
protocol and enthusiast needs.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
representation of each UCS character as a 2-byte word is
referred to as the <b>UCS-2</b> form (only for BMP
characters), whereas <b>UCS-4</b> is the representation of
each character by a 4-byte word. In addition, there exist
two encoding forms <b>UTF-8</b> for backward compatibility
with ASCII processing software and <b>UTF-16</b> for the
backward-compatible handling of non-BMP characters up to
0x10ffff by UCS-2 software.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The UCS
characters 0x0000 to 0x007f are identical to those of the
classic <b>US-ASCII</b> character set and the characters in
the range 0x0000 to 0x00ff are identical to those in <b>ISO
8859-1 Latin-1</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Combining
characters</b> <br>
Some code points in <b>UCS</b> have been assigned to
<i>combining characters</i>. These are similar to the
nonspacing accent keys on a typewriter. A combining
character just adds an accent to the previous character. The
most important accented characters have codes of their own
in UCS, however, the combining character mechanism allows us
to add accents and other diacritical marks to any character.
The combining characters always follow the character which
they modify. For example, the German character Umlaut-A
(&quot;Latin capital letter A with diaeresis&quot;) can
either be represented by the precomposed UCS code 0x00c4, or
alternatively as the combination of a normal &quot;Latin
capital letter A&quot; followed by a &quot;combining
diaeresis&quot;: 0x0041 0x0308.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Combining
characters are essential for instance for encoding the Thai
script or for mathematical typesetting and users of the
International Phonetic Alphabet.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Implementation
levels</b> <br>
As not all systems are expected to support advanced
mechanisms like combining characters, ISO 10646-1 specifies
the following three <i>implementation levels</i> of UCS:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="11%">


<p>Level 1</p></td>
<td width="3%"></td>
<td width="75%">


<p>Combining characters and <b>Hangul Jamo</b> (a variant
encoding of the Korean script, where a Hangul syllable glyph
is coded as a triplet or pair of vovel/consonant codes) are
not supported.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="11%">


<p>Level 2</p></td>
<td width="3%"></td>
<td width="75%">


<p>In addition to level 1, combining characters are now
allowed for some languages where they are essential (e.g.,
Thai, Lao, Hebrew, Arabic, Devanagari, Malayalam).</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="11%">


<p>Level 3</p></td>
<td width="3%"></td>
<td width="75%">


<p>All <b>UCS</b> characters are supported.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The <b>Unicode
3.0 Standard</b> published by the <b>Unicode Consortium</b>
contains exactly the <b>UCS Basic Multilingual Plane</b> at
implementation level 3, as described in ISO 10646-1:2000.
<b>Unicode 3.1</b> added the supplemental planes of ISO
10646-2. The Unicode standard and technical reports
published by the Unicode Consortium provide much additional
information on the semantics and recommended usages of
various characters. They provide guidelines and algorithms
for editing, sorting, comparing, normalizing, converting and
displaying Unicode strings.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Unicode
under Linux</b> <br>
Under GNU/Linux, the C type <i>wchar_t</i> is a signed
32-bit integer type. Its values are always interpreted by
the C library as <b>UCS</b> code values (in all locales), a
convention that is signaled by the GNU C library to
applications by defining the constant
<b>__STDC_ISO_10646__</b> as specified in the ISO C99
standard.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">UCS/Unicode can
be used just like ASCII in input/output streams, terminal
communication, plaintext files, filenames, and environment
variables in the ASCII compatible <b>UTF-8</b> multibyte
encoding. To signal the use of UTF-8 as the character
encoding to all applications, a suitable <i>locale</i> has
to be selected via environment variables (e.g.,
&quot;LANG=en_GB.UTF-8&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>nl_langinfo(CODESET)</b> function returns the name of the
selected encoding. Library functions such as
<b>wctomb</b>(3) and <b>mbsrtowcs</b>(3) can be used to
transform the internal <i>wchar_t</i> characters and strings
into the system character encoding and back and
<b>wcwidth</b>(3) tells, how many positions (0&ndash;2) the
cursor is advanced by the output of a character.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Under Linux, in
general only the BMP at implementation level 1 should be
used at the moment. Up to two combining characters per base
character for certain scripts (in particular Thai) are also
supported by some UTF-8 terminal emulators and ISO 10646
fonts (level 2), but in general precomposed characters
should be preferred where available (Unicode calls this
<b>Normalization Form C</b>).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Private
area</b> <br>
In the <b>BMP</b>, the range 0xe000 to 0xf8ff will never be
assigned to any characters by the standard and is reserved
for private usage. For the Linux community, this private
area has been subdivided further into the range 0xe000 to
0xefff which can be used individually by any end-user and
the Linux zone in the range 0xf000 to 0xf8ff where
extensions are coordinated among all Linux users. The
registry of the characters assigned to the Linux zone is
currently maintained by H. Peter Anvin
&lt;Peter.Anvin@linux.org&gt;.</p>

<h2>BUGS
<a name="BUGS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When this man
page was last revised, the GNU C Library support for
<b>UTF-8</b> locales was mature and XFree86 support was in
an advanced state, but work on making applications (most
notably editors) suitable for use in <b>UTF-8</b> locales
was still fully in progress. Current general <b>UCS</b>
support under Linux usually provides for CJK double-width
characters and sometimes even simple overstriking combining
characters, but usually does not include support for scripts
with right-to-left writing direction or ligature
substitution requirements such as Hebrew, Arabic, or the
Indic scripts. These scripts are currently supported only in
certain GUI applications (HTML viewers, word processors)
with sophisticated text rendering engines.</p>
