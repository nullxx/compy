<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">TCL_MEM_DEBUG
&minus; Compile-time flag to enable Tcl memory debugging
_________________________________________________________________</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When Tcl is
compiled with <b>TCL_MEM_DEBUG</b> defined, a powerful set
of memory debugging aids is included in the compiled binary.
This includes C and Tcl functions which can aid with
debugging memory leaks, memory allocation overruns, and
other memory related errors.</p>

<h2>ENABLING MEMORY DEBUGGING
<a name="ENABLING MEMORY DEBUGGING"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To enable
memory debugging, Tcl should be recompiled from scratch with
<b>TCL_MEM_DEBUG</b> defined (e.g. by passing the
<i>&minus;&minus;enable&minus;symbols=mem</i> flag to the
<i>configure</i> script when building). This will also
compile in a non-stub version of <b>Tcl_InitMemory</b> to
add the <b>memory</b> command to Tcl.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>TCL_MEM_DEBUG</b>
must be either left defined for all modules or undefined for
all modules that are going to be linked together. If they
are not, link errors will occur, with either
<b>Tcl_DbCkfree</b> and <b>Tcl_DbCkalloc</b> or
<b>Tcl_Ckalloc</b> and <b>Tcl_Ckfree</b> being
undefined.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Once memory
debugging support has been compiled into Tcl, the C
functions <b>Tcl_ValidateAllMemory</b>, and
<b>Tcl_DumpActiveMemory</b>, and the Tcl <b>memory</b>
command can be used to validate and examine memory
usage.</p>

<h2>GUARD ZONES
<a name="GUARD ZONES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When memory
debugging is enabled, whenever a call to <b>ckalloc</b> is
made, slightly more memory than requested is allocated so
the memory debugging code can keep track of the allocated
memory, and eight-byte &ldquo;guard zones&rdquo; are placed
in front of and behind the space that will be returned to
the caller. (The sizes of the guard zones are defined by the
C #define <b>LOW_GUARD_SIZE</b> and #define
<b>HIGH_GUARD_SIZE</b> in the file
<i>generic/tclCkalloc.c</i> &mdash; it can be extended if
you suspect large overwrite problems, at some cost in
performance.) A known pattern is written into the guard
zones and, on a call to <b>ckfree</b>, the guard zones of
the space being freed are checked to see if either zone has
been modified in any way. If one has been, the guard bytes
and their new contents are identified, and a &ldquo;low
guard failed&rdquo; or &ldquo;high guard failed&rdquo;
message is issued. The &ldquo;guard failed&rdquo; message
includes the address of the memory packet and the file name
and line number of the code that called <b>ckfree</b>. This
allows you to detect the common sorts of one-off problems,
where not enough space was allocated to contain the data
written, for example.</p>

<h2>DEBUGGING DIFFICULT MEMORY CORRUPTION PROBLEMS
<a name="DEBUGGING DIFFICULT MEMORY CORRUPTION PROBLEMS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Normally, Tcl
compiled with memory debugging enabled will make it easy to
isolate a corruption problem. Turning on memory validation
with the memory command can help isolate difficult problems.
If you suspect (or know) that corruption is occurring before
the Tcl interpreter comes up far enough for you to issue
commands, you can set <b>MEM_VALIDATE</b> define, recompile
tclCkalloc.c and rebuild Tcl. This will enable memory
validation from the first call to <b>ckalloc</b>, again, at
a large performance impact.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you are
desperate and validating memory on every call to
<b>ckalloc</b> and <b>ckfree</b> is not enough, you can
explicitly call <b>Tcl_ValidateAllMemory</b> directly at any
point. It takes a <i>char *</i> and an <i>int</i> which are
normally the filename and line number of the caller, but
they can actually be anything you want. Remember to remove
the calls after you find the problem.</p>
