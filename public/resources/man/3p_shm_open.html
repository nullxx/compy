<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>shm_open</i>() function shall establish a connection
between a shared memory object and a file descriptor. It
shall create an open file description that refers to the
shared memory object and a file descriptor that refers to
that open file description. The file descriptor is used by
other functions to refer to that shared memory object. The
<i>name</i> argument points to a string naming a shared
memory object. It is unspecified whether the name appears in
the file system and is visible to other functions that take
pathnames as arguments. The <i>name</i> argument conforms to
the construction rules for a pathname. If <i>name</i> begins
with the slash character, then processes calling
<i>shm_open</i>() with the same value of <i>name</i> refer
to the same shared memory object, as long as that name has
not been removed. If <i>name</i> does not begin with the
slash character, the effect is implementation-defined. The
interpretation of slash characters other than the leading
slash character in <i>name</i> is
implementation-defined.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If successful,
<i>shm_open</i>() shall return a file descriptor for the
shared memory object that is the lowest numbered file
descriptor not currently open for that process. The open
file description is new, and therefore the file descriptor
does not share it with any other processes. It is
unspecified whether the file offset is set. The FD_CLOEXEC
file descriptor flag associated with the new file descriptor
is set.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The file status
flags and file access modes of the open file description are
according to the value of <i>oflag</i>. The <i>oflag</i>
argument is the bitwise-inclusive OR of the following flags
defined in the <i>&lt;fcntl.h&gt;</i> header. Applications
specify exactly one of the first two values (access modes)
below in the value of <i>oflag</i>: <br>
O_RDONLY</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Open for read access only.</p>

</td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Any combination
of the remaining flags may be specified in the value of
<i>oflag</i>: <br>
O_CREAT</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If the shared memory object
exists, this flag has no effect, except as noted under
O_EXCL below. Otherwise, the shared memory object is
created; the user ID of the shared memory object shall be
set to the effective user ID of the process; the group ID of
the shared memory object is set to a system default group ID
or to the effective group ID of the process. The permission
bits of the shared memory object shall be set to the value
of the <i>mode</i> argument except those set in the file
mode creation mask of the process. When bits in <i>mode</i>
other than the file permission bits are set, the effect is
unspecified. The <i>mode</i> argument does not affect
whether the shared memory object is opened for reading, for
writing, or for both. The shared memory object has a size of
zero.</p>

<p>O_EXCL</p></td>
<td width="2%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>If O_EXCL and O_CREAT are set, <i>shm_open</i>() fails
if the shared memory object exists. The check for the
existence of the shared memory object and the creation of
the object if it does not exist is atomic with respect to
other processes executing <i>shm_open</i>() naming the same
shared memory object with O_EXCL and O_CREAT set. If O_EXCL
is set and O_CREAT is not set, the result is undefined.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">O_TRUNC</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If the shared memory object
exists, and it is successfully opened O_RDWR, the object
shall be truncated to zero length and the mode and owner
shall be unchanged by this function call. The result of
using O_TRUNC with O_RDONLY is undefined.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When a shared
memory object is created, the state of the shared memory
object, including all data associated with the shared memory
object, persists until the shared memory object is unlinked
and all other references are gone. It is unspecified whether
the name and shared memory object state remain valid after a
system reboot.</p>

<h2>RETURN VALUE
<a name="RETURN VALUE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Upon successful
completion, the <i>shm_open</i>() function shall return a
non-negative integer representing the lowest numbered unused
file descriptor. Otherwise, it shall return -1 and set
<i>errno</i> to indicate the error.</p>

<h2>APPLICATION USAGE

<h2>RATIONALE
<a name="RATIONALE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When the Memory
Mapped Files option is supported, the normal <i>open</i>()
call is used to obtain a descriptor to a file to be mapped
according to existing practice with <i>mmap</i>(). When the
Shared Memory Objects option is supported, the
<i>shm_open</i>() function shall obtain a descriptor to the
shared memory object to be mapped.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There is ample
precedent for having a file descriptor represent several
types of objects. In the POSIX.1-1990 standard, a file
descriptor can represent a file, a pipe, a FIFO, a tty, or a
directory. Many implementations simply have an operations
vector, which is indexed by the file descriptor type and
does very different operations. Note that in some cases the
file descriptor passed to generic operations on file
descriptors is returned by <i>open</i>() or <i>creat</i>()
and in some cases returned by alternate functions, such as
<i>pipe</i>(). The latter technique is used by
<i>shm_open</i>().</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that such
shared memory objects can actually be implemented as mapped
files. In both cases, the size can be set after the open
using <i>ftruncate</i>(). The <i>shm_open</i>() function
itself does not create a shared object of a specified size
because this would duplicate an extant function that set the
size of an object referenced by a file descriptor.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On
implementations where memory objects are implemented using
the existing file system, the <i>shm_open</i>() function may
be implemented using a macro that invokes <i>open</i>(), and
the <i>shm_unlink</i>() function may be implemented using a
macro that invokes <i>unlink</i>().</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For
implementations without a permanent file system, the
definition of the name of the memory objects is allowed not
to survive a system reboot. Note that this allows systems
with a permanent file system to implement memory objects as
data structures internal to the implementation as well.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On
implementations that choose to implement memory objects
using memory directly, a <i>shm_open</i>() followed by an
<i>ftruncate</i>() and <i>close</i>() can be used to
preallocate a shared memory area and to set the size of that
preallocation. This may be necessary for systems without
virtual memory hardware support in order to ensure that the
memory is contiguous.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The set of
valid open flags to <i>shm_open</i>() was restricted to
O_RDONLY, O_RDWR, O_CREAT, and O_TRUNC because these could
be easily implemented on most memory mapping systems. This
volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 is silent on the
results if the implementation cannot supply the requested
file access because of implementation-defined reasons,
including hardware ones.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The error
conditions [EACCES] and [ENOTSUP] are provided to inform the
application that the implementation cannot complete a
request.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">[EACCES]
indicates for implementation-defined reasons, probably
hardware-related, that the implementation cannot comply with
a requested mode because it conflicts with another requested
mode. An example might be that an application desires to
open a memory object two times, mapping different areas with
different access modes. If the implementation cannot map a
single area into a process space in two places, which would
be required if different access modes were required for the
two areas, then the implementation may inform the
application at the time of the second open.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">[ENOTSUP]
indicates for implementation-defined reasons, probably
hardware-related, that the implementation cannot comply with
a requested mode at all. An example would be that the
hardware of the implementation cannot support write-only
shared memory areas.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On all
implementations, it may be desirable to restrict the
location of the memory objects to specific file systems for
performance (such as a RAM disk) or implementation-defined
reasons (shared memory supported directly only on certain
file systems). The <i>shm_open</i>() function may be used to
enforce these restrictions. There are a number of methods
available to the application to determine an appropriate
name of the file or the location of an appropriate
directory. One way is from the environment via
<i>getenv</i>(). Another would be from a configuration
file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This volume of
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 specifies that memory objects
have initial contents of zero when created. This is
consistent with current behavior for both files and newly
allocated memory. For those implementations that use
physical memory, it would be possible that such
implementations could simply use available memory and give
it to the process uninitialized. This, however, is not
consistent with standard behavior for the uninitialized data
area, the stack, and of course, files. Finally, it is highly
desirable to set the allocated memory to zero for security
reasons. Thus, initializing memory objects to zero is
required.</p>
