<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Class Based
Queueing is a classful qdisc that implements a rich
linksharing hierarchy of classes. It contains shaping
elements as well as prioritizing capabilities. Shaping is
performed using link idle time calculations based on the
timing of dequeue events and underlying link bandwidth.</p>

<h2>SHAPING ALGORITHM
<a name="SHAPING ALGORITHM"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Shaping is done
using link idle time calculations, and actions taken if
these calculations deviate from set limits.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When shaping a
10mbit/s connection to 1mbit/s, the link will be idle 90% of
the time. If it isn&rsquo;t, it needs to be throttled so
that it IS idle 90% of the time.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">From the
kernel&rsquo;s perspective, this is hard to measure, so CBQ
instead derives the idle time from the number of
microseconds (in fact, jiffies) that elapse between requests
from the device driver for more data. Combined with the
knowledge of packet sizes, this is used to approximate how
full or empty the link is.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This is rather
circumspect and doesn&rsquo;t always arrive at proper
results. For example, what is the actual link speed of an
interface that is not really able to transmit the full
100mbit/s of data, perhaps because of a badly implemented
driver? A PCMCIA network card will also never achieve
100mbit/s because of the way the bus is designed - again,
how do we calculate the idle time?</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The physical
link bandwidth may be ill defined in case of not-quite-real
network devices like PPP over Ethernet or PPTP over TCP/IP.
The effective bandwidth in that case is probably determined
by the efficiency of pipes to userspace - which not
defined.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">During
operations, the effective idletime is measured using an
exponential weighted moving average (EWMA), which considers
recent packets to be exponentially more important than past
ones. The Unix loadaverage is calculated in the same
way.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The calculated
idle time is subtracted from the EWMA measured one, the
resulting number is called &rsquo;avgidle&rsquo;. A
perfectly loaded link has an avgidle of zero: packets arrive
exactly at the calculated interval.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">An overloaded
link has a negative avgidle and if it gets too negative, CBQ
throttles and is then &rsquo;overlimit&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Conversely, an
idle link might amass a huge avgidle, which would then allow
infinite bandwidths after a few hours of silence. To prevent
this, avgidle is capped at <b>maxidle.</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If overlimit,
in theory, the CBQ could throttle itself for exactly the
amount of time that was calculated to pass between packets,
and then pass one packet, and throttle again. Due to timer
resolution constraints, this may not be feasible, see the
<b>minburst</b> parameter below.</p>

<h2>CLASSIFICATION
<a name="CLASSIFICATION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Within the one
CBQ instance many classes may exist. Each of these classes
contains another qdisc, by default <b>tc-pfifo</b>(8).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When enqueueing
a packet, CBQ starts at the root and uses various methods to
determine which class should receive the data. If a verdict
is reached, this process is repeated for the recipient class
which might have further means of classifying traffic to its
children, if any.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">CBQ has the
following methods available to classify a packet to any
child classes.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="7%">


<p>(i)</p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p><b>skb-&gt;priority class encoding.</b> Can be set from
userspace by an application with the <b>SO_PRIORITY</b>
setsockopt. The <b>skb-&gt;priority class encoding</b> only
applies if the skb-&gt;priority holds a major:minor handle
of an existing class within this qdisc.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="7%">


<p>(ii)</p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>tc filters attached to the class.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="7%">


<p>(iii)</p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>The defmap of a class, as set with the <b>split &amp;
defmap</b> parameters. The defmap may contain instructions
for each possible Linux packet priority.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Each class also
has a <b>level.</b> Leaf nodes, attached to the bottom of
the class hierarchy, have a level of 0.</p>

<h2>CLASSIFICATION ALGORITHM
<a name="CLASSIFICATION ALGORITHM"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Classification
is a loop, which terminates when a leaf class is found. At
any point the loop may jump to the fallback algorithm.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The loop
consists of the following steps:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="7%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">(i)</p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the packet is generated
locally and has a valid classid encoded within its
<b>skb-&gt;priority,</b> choose it and terminate.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="7%">


<p>(ii)</p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>Consult the tc filters, if any, attached to this child.
If these return a class which is not a leaf class, restart
loop from the class returned. If it is a leaf, choose it and
terminate.</p> </td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="7%">


<p>(iii)</p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>If the tc filters did not return a class, but did return
a classid, try to find a class with that id within this
qdisc. Check if the found class is of a lower <b>level</b>
than the current class. If so, and the returned class is not
a leaf node, restart the loop at the found class. If it is a
leaf node, terminate. If we found an upward reference to a
higher level, enter the fallback algorithm.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="7%">


<p>(iv)</p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>If the tc filters did not return a class, nor a valid
reference to one, consider the minor number of the reference
to be the priority. Retrieve a class from the defmap of this
class for the priority. If this did not contain a class,
consult the defmap of this class for the <b>BEST_EFFORT</b>
class. If this is an upward reference, or no
<b>BEST_EFFORT</b> class was defined, enter the fallback
algorithm. If a valid class was found, and it is not a leaf
node, restart the loop at this class. If it is a leaf,
choose it and terminate. If neither the priority distilled
from the classid, nor the <b>BEST_EFFORT</b> priority
yielded a class, enter the fallback algorithm.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The fallback
algorithm resides outside of the loop and is as follows.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="7%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">(i)</p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">Consult the defmap of the class
at which the jump to fallback occured. If the defmap
contains a class for the <b>priority</b> of the class (which
is related to the TOS field), choose this class and
terminate.</p> </td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="7%">


<p>(ii)</p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>Consult the map for a class for the <b>BEST_EFFORT</b>
priority. If found, choose it, and terminate.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="7%">


<p>(iii)</p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>Choose the class at which break out to the fallback
algorithm occurred. Terminate.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The packet is
enqueued to the class which was chosen when either algorithm
terminated. It is therefore possible for a packet to be
enqueued *not* at a leaf node, but in the middle of the
hierarchy.</p>

<h2>LINK SHARING ALGORITHM
<a name="LINK SHARING ALGORITHM"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When dequeuing
for sending to the network device, CBQ decides which of its
classes will be allowed to send. It does so with a Weighted
Round Robin process in which each class with packets gets a
chance to send in turn. The WRR process starts by asking the
highest priority classes (lowest numerically - highest
semantically) for packets, and will continue to do so until
they have no more data to offer, in which case the process
repeats for lower priorities.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>CERTAINTY
ENDS HERE, ANK PLEASE HELP</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Each class is
not allowed to send at length though - they can only dequeue
a configurable amount of data during each round.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If a class is
about to go overlimit, and it is not <b>bounded</b> it will
try to borrow avgidle from siblings that are not
<b>isolated.</b> This process is repeated from the bottom
upwards. If a class is unable to borrow enough avgidle to
send a packet, it is throttled and not asked for a packet
for enough time for the avgidle to increase above zero.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>I REALLY
NEED HELP FIGURING THIS OUT. REST OF DOCUMENT IS PRETTY
CERTAIN AGAIN.</b></p>

<h2>QDISC
<a name="QDISC"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The root qdisc
of a CBQ class tree has the following parameters: <br>
parent major:minor | root</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This mandatory parameter
determines the place of the CBQ instance, either at the
<b>root</b> of an interface or within an existing class.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">handle major:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Like all other qdiscs, the CBQ
can be assigned a handle. Should consist only of a major
number, followed by a colon. Optional.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">avpkt bytes</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">For calculations, the average
packet size must be known. It is silently capped at a
minimum of 2/3 of the interface MTU. Mandatory.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">bandwidth rate</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">To determine the idle time, CBQ
must know the bandwidth of your underlying physical
interface, or parent qdisc. This is a vital parameter, more
about it later. Mandatory.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="6%">


<p>cell</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>The cell size determines he granularity of packet
transmission time calculations. Has a sensible default.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="6%">


<p>mpu</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>A zero sized packet may still take time to transmit.
This value is the lower cap for packet transmission time
calculations - packets smaller than this value are still
deemed to have this size. Defaults to zero.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">ewma log</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">When CBQ needs to measure the
average idle time, it does so using an Exponentially
Weighted Moving Average which smooths out measurements into
a moving average. The EWMA LOG determines how much smoothing
occurs. Defaults to 5. Lower values imply greater
sensitivity. Must be between 0 and 31.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A CBQ qdisc
does not shape out of its own accord. It only needs to know
certain parameters about the underlying link. Actual shaping
is done in classes.</p>

<h2>CLASSES
<a name="CLASSES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Classes have a
host of parameters to configure their operation. <br>
parent major:minor</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Place of this class within the
hierarchy. If attached directly to a qdisc and not to
another class, minor can be omitted. Mandatory.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">classid major:minor</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Like qdiscs, classes can be
named. The major number must be equal to the major number of
the qdisc to which it belongs. Optional, but needed if this
class is going to have children.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">weight weight</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">When dequeuing to the
interface, classes are tried for traffic in a round-robin
fashion. Classes with a higher configured qdisc will
generally have more traffic to offer during each round, so
it makes sense to allow it to dequeue more traffic. All
weights under a class are normalized, so only the ratios
matter. Defaults to the configured rate, unless the priority
of this class is maximal, in which case it is set to 1.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">allot bytes</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Allot specifies how many bytes
a qdisc can dequeue during each round of the process. This
parameter is weighted using the renormalized class weight
described above.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">priority priority</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">In the round-robin process,
classes with the lowest priority field are tried for packets
first. Mandatory.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">rate rate</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Maximum rate this class and all
its children combined can send at. Mandatory.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">bandwidth rate</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This is different from the
bandwidth specified when creating a CBQ disc. Only used to
determine maxidle and offtime, which are only calculated
when specifying maxburst or minburst. Mandatory if
specifying maxburst or minburst.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">maxburst</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This number of packets is used
to calculate maxidle so that when avgidle is at maxidle,
this number of average packets can be burst before avgidle
drops to 0. Set it higher to be more tolerant of bursts. You
can&rsquo;t set maxidle directly, only via this
parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">minburst</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">As mentioned before, CBQ needs
to throttle in case of overlimit. The ideal solution is to
do so for exactly the calculated idle time, and pass 1
packet. However, Unix kernels generally have a hard time
scheduling events shorter than 10ms, so it is better to
throttle for a longer period, and then pass minburst packets
in one go, and then sleep minburst times longer.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The time to
wait is called the offtime. Higher values of minburst lead
to more accurate shaping in the long term, but to bigger
bursts at millisecond timescales.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">minidle</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If avgidle is below 0, we are
overlimits and need to wait until avgidle will be big enough
to send one packet. To prevent a sudden burst from shutting
down the link for a prolonged period of time, avgidle is
reset to minidle if it gets too low.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Minidle is
specified in negative microseconds, so 10 means that avgidle
is capped at -10us.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">bounded</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Signifies that this class will
not borrow bandwidth from its siblings.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">isolated</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Means that this class will not
borrow bandwidth to its siblings</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">split major:minor &amp; defmap
bitmap[/bitmap]</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If consulting filters attached
to a class did not give a verdict, CBQ can also classify
based on the packet&rsquo;s priority. There are 16
priorities available, numbered from 0 to 15.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The defmap
specifies which priorities this class wants to receive,
specified as a bitmap. The Least Significant Bit corresponds
to priority zero. The <b>split</b> parameter tells CBQ at
which class the decision must be made, which should be a
(grand)parent of the class you are adding.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">As an example,
&rsquo;tc class add ... classid 10:1 cbq .. split 10:0
defmap c0&rsquo; configures class 10:0 to send packets with
priorities 6 and 7 to 10:1.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The
complimentary configuration would then be: &rsquo;tc class
add ... classid 10:2 cbq ... split 10:0 defmap 3f&rsquo;
Which would send all packets 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 to
10:1.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">estimator interval
timeconstant</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">CBQ can measure how much
bandwidth each class is using, which tc filters can use to
classify packets with. In order to determine the bandwidth
it uses a very simple estimator that measures once every
<b>interval</b> microseconds how much traffic has passed.
This again is a EWMA, for which the time constant can be
specified, also in microseconds. The <b>time constant</b>
corresponds to the sluggishness of the measurement or,
conversely, to the sensitivity of the average to short
bursts. Higher values mean less sensitivity.</p>
