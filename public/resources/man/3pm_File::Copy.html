<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The File::Copy
module provides two basic functions,
<tt>&quot;copy&quot;</tt> and <tt>&quot;move&quot;</tt>,
which are useful for getting the contents of a file from one
place to another. <br>
copy</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The <tt>&quot;copy&quot;</tt>
function takes two parameters: a file to copy from and a
file to copy to. Either argument may be a string, a
FileHandle reference or a FileHandle glob. Obviously, if the
first argument is a filehandle of some sort, it will be read
from, and if it is a file <i>name</i> it will be opened for
reading. Likewise, the second argument will be written to
(and created if need be). Trying to copy a file on top of
itself is a fatal error.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If the
destination (second argument) already exists and is a
directory, and the source (first argument) is not a
filehandle, then the source file will be copied into the
directory specified by the destination, using the same base
name as the source file. It&rsquo;s a failure to have a
filehandle as the source when the destination is a
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Note that
passing in files as handles instead of names may lead to
loss of information on some operating systems; it is
recommended that you use file names whenever possible.</b>
Files are opened in binary mode where applicable. To get a
consistent behaviour when copying from a filehandle to a
file, use <tt>&quot;binmode&quot;</tt> on the
filehandle.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">An optional
third parameter can be used to specify the buffer size used
for copying. This is the number of bytes from the first
file, that will be held in memory at any given time, before
being written to the second file. The default buffer size
depends upon the file, but will generally be the whole file
(up to 2MB), or 1k for filehandles that do not reference
files (eg. sockets).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">You may use the
syntax <tt>&quot;use File::Copy &quot;cp&quot;&quot;</tt> to
get at the <tt>&quot;cp&quot;</tt> alias for this function.
The syntax is <i>exactly</i> the same. The behavior is
nearly the same as well: as of version 2.15, &lt;cp&gt; will
preserve the source file&rsquo;s permission bits like the
shell utility <tt>cp(1)</tt> would do, while
<tt>&quot;copy&quot;</tt> uses the default permissions for
the target file (which may depend on the process&rsquo;
<tt>&quot;umask&quot;</tt>, file ownership, inherited ACLs,
etc.). If an error occurs in setting permissions,
<tt>&quot;cp&quot;</tt> will return 0, regardless of whether
the file was successfully copied.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">move</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The <tt>&quot;move&quot;</tt>
function also takes two parameters: the current name and the
intended name of the file to be moved. If the destination
already exists and is a directory, and the source is not a
directory, then the source file will be renamed into the
directory specified by the destination.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If possible,
<i>move()</i> will simply rename the file. Otherwise, it
copies the file to the new location and deletes the
original. If an error occurs during this copy-and-delete
process, you may be left with a (possibly partial) copy of
the file under the destination name.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">You may use the
<tt>&quot;mv&quot;</tt> alias for this function in the same
way that you may use the &lt;cp&gt; alias for
<tt>&quot;copy&quot;</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">syscopy</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">File::Copy also provides the
<tt>&quot;syscopy&quot;</tt> routine, which copies the file
specified in the first parameter to the file specified in
the second parameter, preserving OS-specific attributes and
file structure. For Unix systems, this is equivalent to the
simple <tt>&quot;copy&quot;</tt> routine, which
doesn&rsquo;t preserve OS-specific attributes. For
<small>VMS</small> systems, this calls the
<tt>&quot;rmscopy&quot;</tt> routine (see below). For
<small>OS/2</small> systems, this calls the
<tt>&quot;syscopy&quot;</tt> <small>XSUB</small> directly.
For Win32 systems, this calls
<tt>&quot;Win32::CopyFile&quot;</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Special
behaviour if &quot;syscopy&quot; is defined (
<small>OS/2</small> , <small>VMS</small> and Win32)</b>:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If both
arguments to <tt>&quot;copy&quot;</tt> are not file handles,
then <tt>&quot;copy&quot;</tt> will perform a &quot;system
copy&quot; of the input file to a new output file, in order
to preserve file attributes, indexed file structure,
<i>etc.</i> The buffer size parameter is ignored. If either
argument to <tt>&quot;copy&quot;</tt> is a handle to an
opened file, then data is copied using Perl operators, and
no effort is made to preserve file attributes or record
structure.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The system copy
routine may also be called directly under <small>VMS</small>
and <small>OS/2</small> as
<tt>&quot;File::Copy::syscopy&quot;</tt> (or under
<small>VMS</small> as
<tt>&quot;File::Copy::rmscopy&quot;</tt>, which is the
routine that does the actual work for syscopy).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;">rmscopy($from,$to[,$date_flag])</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The first and second arguments
may be strings, typeglobs, typeglob references, or objects
inheriting from IO::Handle; they are used in all cases to
obtain the <i>filespec</i> of the input and output files,
respectively. The name and type of the input file are used
as defaults for the output file, if necessary.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">A new version
of the output file is always created, which inherits the
structure and <small>RMS</small> attributes of the input
file, except for owner and protections (and possibly
timestamps; see below). All data from the input file is
copied to the output file; if either of the first two
parameters to <tt>&quot;rmscopy&quot;</tt> is a file handle,
its position is unchanged. (Note that this means a file
handle pointing to the output file will be associated with
an old version of that file after
<tt>&quot;rmscopy&quot;</tt> returns, not the newly created
version.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The third
parameter is an integer flag, which tells
<tt>&quot;rmscopy&quot;</tt> how to handle timestamps. If it
is &lt; 0, none of the input file&rsquo;s timestamps are
propagated to the output file. If it is &gt; 0, then it is
interpreted as a bitmask: if bit 0 (the <small>LSB</small> )
is set, then timestamps other than the revision date are
propagated; if bit 1 is set, the revision date is
propagated. If the third parameter to
<tt>&quot;rmscopy&quot;</tt> is 0, then it behaves much like
the <small>DCL COPY</small> command: if the name or type of
the output file was explicitly specified, then no timestamps
are propagated, but if they were taken implicitly from the
input filespec, then all timestamps other than the revision
date are propagated. If this parameter is not supplied, it
defaults to 0.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Like
<tt>&quot;copy&quot;</tt>, <tt>&quot;rmscopy&quot;</tt>
returns 1 on success. If an error occurs, it sets
<tt>$!</tt>, deletes the output file, and returns 0.</p>

<h2>RETURN
<a name="RETURN"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">All functions
return 1 on success, 0 on failure. $! will be set if an
error was encountered.</p>
