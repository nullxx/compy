<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The C
preprocessor, often known as <i>cpp</i>, is a <i>macro
processor</i> that is used automatically by the C compiler
to transform your program before compilation. It is called a
macro processor because it allows you to define
<i>macros</i>, which are brief abbreviations for longer
constructs.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The C
preprocessor is intended to be used only with C, C
<small>++</small> , and Objective-C source code. In the
past, it has been abused as a general text processor. It
will choke on input which does not obey C&rsquo;s lexical
rules. For example, apostrophes will be interpreted as the
beginning of character constants, and cause errors. Also,
you cannot rely on it preserving characteristics of the
input which are not significant to C&minus;family languages.
If a Makefile is preprocessed, all the hard tabs will be
removed, and the Makefile will not work.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Having said
that, you can often get away with using cpp on things which
are not C. Other Algol-ish programming languages are often
safe (Pascal, Ada, etc.) So is assembly, with caution.
<b>&minus;traditional&minus;cpp</b> mode preserves more
white space, and is otherwise more permissive. Many of the
problems can be avoided by writing C or C <small>++</small>
style comments instead of native language comments, and
keeping macros simple.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Wherever
possible, you should use a preprocessor geared to the
language you are writing in. Modern versions of the
<small>GNU</small> assembler have macro facilities. Most
high level programming languages have their own conditional
compilation and inclusion mechanism. If all else fails, try
a true general text processor, such as <small>GNU
M4.</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">C preprocessors
vary in some details. This manual discusses the <small>GNU
C</small> preprocessor, which provides a small superset of
the features of <small>ISO</small> Standard C. In its
default mode, the <small>GNU C</small> preprocessor does not
do a few things required by the standard. These are features
which are rarely, if ever, used, and may cause surprising
changes to the meaning of a program which does not expect
them. To get strict <small>ISO</small> Standard C, you
should use the <b>&minus;std=c90</b>, <b>&minus;std=c99</b>
or <b>&minus;std=c11</b> options, depending on which version
of the standard you want. To get all the mandatory
diagnostics, you must also use <b>&minus;pedantic</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This manual
describes the behavior of the <small>ISO</small>
preprocessor. To minimize gratuitous differences, where the
<small>ISO</small> preprocessor&rsquo;s behavior does not
conflict with traditional semantics, the traditional
preprocessor should behave the same way. The various
differences that do exist are detailed in the section
<b>Traditional Mode</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For clarity,
unless noted otherwise, references to
<b><small>CPP</small></b> in this manual refer to <small>GNU
CPP.</small></p>

<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The C
preprocessor expects two file names as arguments,
<i>infile</i> and <i>outfile</i>. The preprocessor reads
<i>infile</i> together with any other files it specifies
with <b>#include</b>. All the output generated by the
combined input files is written in <i>outfile</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Either
<i>infile</i> or <i>outfile</i> may be <b>&minus;</b>, which
as <i>infile</i> means to read from standard input and as
<i>outfile</i> means to write to standard output. Also, if
either file is omitted, it means the same as if
<b>&minus;</b> had been specified for that file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Unless
otherwise noted, or the option ends in <b>=</b>, all options
which take an argument may have that argument appear either
immediately after the option, or with a space between option
and argument: <b>&minus;Ifoo</b> and <b>&minus;I foo</b>
have the same effect.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Many options
have multi-letter names; therefore multiple single-letter
options may <i>not</i> be grouped: <b>&minus;dM</b> is very
different from <b>&minus;d&nbsp;&minus;M</b>. <b><br>
&minus;D</b> <i>name</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Predefine <i>name</i> as a
macro, with definition <tt>1</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;D</b>
<i>name</i><b>=</b><i>definition</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The contents of
<i>definition</i> are tokenized and processed as if they
appeared during translation phase three in a <b>#define</b>
directive. In particular, the definition will be truncated
by embedded newline characters.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If you are
invoking the preprocessor from a shell or shell-like program
you may need to use the shell&rsquo;s quoting syntax to
protect characters such as spaces that have a meaning in the
shell syntax.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If you wish to
define a function-like macro on the command line, write its
argument list with surrounding parentheses before the equals
sign (if any). Parentheses are meaningful to most shells, so
you will need to quote the option. With <b>sh</b> and
<b>csh</b>,
<b>&minus;D&rsquo;</b><i>name</i><b>(</b><i>args...</i><b>)=</b><i>definition</i><b>&rsquo;</b>
works.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;D</b>
and <b>&minus;U</b> options are processed in the order they
are given on the command line. All <b>&minus;imacros</b>
<i>file</i> and <b>&minus;include</b> <i>file</i> options
are processed after all <b>&minus;D</b> and <b>&minus;U</b>
options.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;U</b> <i>name</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Cancel any previous definition
of <i>name</i>, either built in or provided with a
<b>&minus;D</b> option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;undef</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Do not predefine any
system-specific or GCC-specific macros. The standard
predefined macros remain defined.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;I</b> <i>dir</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Add the directory <i>dir</i> to
the list of directories to be searched for header files.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Directories
named by <b>&minus;I</b> are searched before the standard
system include directories. If the directory <i>dir</i> is a
standard system include directory, the option is ignored to
ensure that the default search order for system directories
and the special treatment of system headers are not defeated
. If <i>dir</i> begins with <tt>&quot;=&quot;</tt>, then the
<tt>&quot;=&quot;</tt> will be replaced by the sysroot
prefix; see <b>&minus;&minus;sysroot</b> and
<b>&minus;isysroot</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;o</b> <i>file</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Write output to <i>file</i>.
This is the same as specifying <i>file</i> as the second
non-option argument to <b>cpp</b>. <b>gcc</b> has a
different interpretation of a second non-option argument, so
you must use <b>&minus;o</b> to specify the output file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;Wall</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Turns on all optional warnings
which are desirable for normal code. At present this is
<b>&minus;Wcomment</b>, <b>&minus;Wtrigraphs</b>,
<b>&minus;Wmultichar</b> and a warning about integer
promotion causing a change of sign in
<tt>&quot;#if&quot;</tt> expressions. Note that many of the
preprocessor&rsquo;s warnings are on by default and have no
options to control them.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;Wcomment <br>
&minus;Wcomments</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Warn whenever a comment-start
sequence <b>/*</b> appears in a <b>/*</b> comment, or
whenever a backslash-newline appears in a <b>//</b> comment.
(Both forms have the same effect.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;Wtrigraphs</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Most trigraphs in comments
cannot affect the meaning of the program. However, a
trigraph that would form an escaped newline (<b>??/</b> at
the end of a line) can, by changing where the comment begins
or ends. Therefore, only trigraphs that would form escaped
newlines produce warnings inside a comment.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This option is
implied by <b>&minus;Wall</b>. If <b>&minus;Wall</b> is not
given, this option is still enabled unless trigraphs are
enabled. To get trigraph conversion without warnings, but
get the other <b>&minus;Wall</b> warnings, use
<b>&minus;trigraphs &minus;Wall
&minus;Wno&minus;trigraphs</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;Wtraditional</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Warn about certain constructs
that behave differently in traditional and <small>ISO
C.</small> Also warn about <small>ISO C</small> constructs
that have no traditional C equivalent, and problematic
constructs which should be avoided.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;Wundef</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Warn whenever an identifier
which is not a macro is encountered in an <b>#if</b>
directive, outside of <b>defined</b>. Such identifiers are
replaced with zero.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;Wunused&minus;macros</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Warn about macros defined in
the main file that are unused. A macro is <i>used</i> if it
is expanded or tested for existence at least once. The
preprocessor will also warn if the macro has not been used
at the time it is redefined or undefined.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Built-in
macros, macros defined on the command line, and macros
defined in include files are not warned about.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Note:</i> If
a macro is actually used, but only used in skipped
conditional blocks, then <small>CPP</small> will report it
as unused. To avoid the warning in such a case, you might
improve the scope of the macro&rsquo;s definition by, for
example, moving it into the first skipped block.
Alternatively, you could provide a dummy use with something
like:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">        #if defined the_macro_causing_the_warning
        #endif</pre>



<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;Wendif&minus;labels</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Warn whenever an <b>#else</b>
or an <b>#endif</b> are followed by text. This usually
happens in code of the form</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">        #if FOO
        ...
        #else FOO
        ...
        #endif FOO</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The second and
third <tt>&quot;FOO&quot;</tt> should be in comments, but
often are not in older programs. This warning is on by
default.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;Werror</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Make all warnings into hard
errors. Source code which triggers warnings will be
rejected.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;Wsystem&minus;headers</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Issue warnings for code in
system headers. These are normally unhelpful in finding bugs
in your own code, therefore suppressed. If you are
responsible for the system library, you may want to see
them.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;pedantic</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Issue all the mandatory
diagnostics listed in the C standard. Some of them are left
out by default, since they trigger frequently on harmless
code.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;pedantic&minus;errors</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Issue all the mandatory
diagnostics, and make all mandatory diagnostics into errors.
This includes mandatory diagnostics that <small>GCC</small>
issues without <b>&minus;pedantic</b> but treats as
warnings.</p>

<td width="3%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>Instead of outputting the result of preprocessing,
output a rule suitable for <b>make</b> describing the
dependencies of the main source file. The preprocessor
outputs one <b>make</b> rule containing the object file name
for that source file, a colon, and the names of all the
included files, including those coming from
<b>&minus;include</b> or <b>&minus;imacros</b> command line
options.</p> </td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Unless
specified explicitly (with <b>&minus;MT</b> or
<b>&minus;MQ</b>), the object file name consists of the name
of the source file with any suffix replaced with object file
suffix and with any leading directory parts removed. If
there are many included files then the rule is split into
several lines using <b>\</b>&minus;newline. The rule has no
commands.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This option
does not suppress the preprocessor&rsquo;s debug output,
such as <b>&minus;dM</b>. To avoid mixing such debug output
with the dependency rules you should explicitly specify the
dependency output file with <b>&minus;MF</b>, or use an
environment variable like
<b><small>DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT</small></b> . Debug output
will still be sent to the regular output stream as
normal.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Passing
<b>&minus;M</b> to the driver implies <b>&minus;E</b>, and
suppresses warnings with an implicit <b>&minus;w</b>.</p>

<td width="83%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">Like <b>&minus;M</b> but do not
mention header files that are found in system header
directories, nor header files that are included, directly or
indirectly, from such a header.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This implies
that the choice of angle brackets or double quotes in an
<b>#include</b> directive does not in itself determine
whether that header will appear in <b>&minus;MM</b>
dependency output. This is a slight change in semantics from
<small>GCC</small> versions 3.0 and earlier.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;MF</b>
<i>file</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When used with <b>&minus;M</b>
or <b>&minus;MM</b>, specifies a file to write the
dependencies to. If no <b>&minus;MF</b> switch is given the
preprocessor sends the rules to the same place it would have
sent preprocessed output.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">When used with
the driver options <b>&minus;MD</b> or <b>&minus;MMD</b>,
<b>&minus;MF</b> overrides the default dependency output
file.</p>

<p><b>&minus;MG</b></p></td>
<td width="2%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>In conjunction with an option such as <b>&minus;M</b>
requesting dependency generation, <b>&minus;MG</b> assumes
missing header files are generated files and adds them to
the dependency list without raising an error. The dependency
filename is taken directly from the
<tt>&quot;#include&quot;</tt> directive without prepending
any path. <b>&minus;MG</b> also suppresses preprocessed
output, as a missing header file renders this useless.</p></td></tr>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This feature is

<td width="83%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">This option instructs
<small>CPP</small> to add a phony target for each dependency
other than the main file, causing each to depend on nothing.
These dummy rules work around errors <b>make</b> gives if
you remove header files without updating the <i>Makefile</i>
to match.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This is typical
output:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">        test.o: test.c test.h
        test.h:</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;MT</b>
<i>target</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Change the target of the rule
emitted by dependency generation. By default
<small>CPP</small> takes the name of the main input file,
deletes any directory components and any file suffix such as
<b>.c</b>, and appends the platform&rsquo;s usual object
suffix. The result is the target.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">An
<b>&minus;MT</b> option will set the target to be exactly
the string you specify. If you want multiple targets, you
can specify them as a single argument to <b>&minus;MT</b>,
or use multiple <b>&minus;MT</b> options.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">For example,
<b>&minus;MT&nbsp;&rsquo;$(objpfx)foo.o&rsquo;</b> might
give</p>

it quotes any characters which are special to Make.
<b>&minus;MQ&nbsp;&rsquo;$(objpfx)foo.o&rsquo;</b> gives</p>

<td width="2%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p><b>&minus;MD</b> is equivalent to <b>&minus;M
&minus;MF</b> <i>file</i>, except that <b>&minus;E</b> is
not implied. The driver determines <i>file</i> based on
whether an <b>&minus;o</b> option is given. If it is, the
driver uses its argument but with a suffix of <i>.d</i>,
otherwise it takes the name of the input file, removes any
directory components and suffix, and applies a <i>.d</i>
suffix.</p> </td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If
<b>&minus;MD</b> is used in conjunction with
<b>&minus;E</b>, any <b>&minus;o</b> switch is understood to
specify the dependency output file, but if used without
<b>&minus;E</b>, each <b>&minus;o</b> is understood to
specify a target object file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Since
<b>&minus;E</b> is not implied, <b>&minus;MD</b> can be used
to generate a dependency output file as a side-effect of the
compilation process.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;MMD</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Like <b>&minus;MD</b> except
mention only user header files, not system header files.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;x c <br>
&minus;x c++ <br>
&minus;x objective-c <br>
&minus;x assembler-with-cpp</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Specify the source language: C,
C <small>++</small> , Objective-C, or assembly. This has
nothing to do with standards conformance or extensions; it
merely selects which base syntax to expect. If you give none
of these options, cpp will deduce the language from the
extension of the source file: <b>.c</b>, <b>.cc</b>,
<b>.m</b>, or <b>.S</b>. Some other common extensions for C
<small>++</small> and assembly are also recognized. If cpp
does not recognize the extension, it will treat the file as
C; this is the most generic mode.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Note:</i>
Previous versions of cpp accepted a <b>&minus;lang</b>
option which selected both the language and the standards
conformance level. This option has been removed, because it
conflicts with the <b>&minus;l</b> option.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;std=</b><i>standard</i>
<b><br>
&minus;ansi</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Specify the standard to which

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;fdirectives&minus;only</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When preprocessing, handle
directives, but do not expand macros.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The
option&rsquo;s behavior depends on the <b>&minus;E</b> and
<b>&minus;fpreprocessed</b> options.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">With
<b>&minus;E</b>, preprocessing is limited to the handling of
directives such as <tt>&quot;#define&quot;</tt>,
<tt>&quot;#ifdef&quot;</tt>, and
<tt>&quot;#error&quot;</tt>. Other preprocessor operations,
such as macro expansion and trigraph conversion are not
performed. In addition, the <b>&minus;dD</b> option is
implicitly enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">With
<b>&minus;fpreprocessed</b>, predefinition of command line
and most builtin macros is disabled. Macros such as
<tt>&quot;__LINE__&quot;</tt>, which are contextually
dependent, are handled normally. This enables compilation of
files previously preprocessed with <tt>&quot;&minus;E
&minus;fdirectives&minus;only&quot;</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">With both
<b>&minus;E</b> and <b>&minus;fpreprocessed</b>, the rules
for <b>&minus;fpreprocessed</b> take precedence. This
enables full preprocessing of files previously preprocessed

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;fdollars&minus;in&minus;identifiers</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Accept <b>$</b> in
identifiers.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;fextended&minus;identifiers</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Accept universal character
names in identifiers. This option is experimental; in a
future version of <small>GCC,</small> it will be enabled by
default for C99 and C <small>++</small> .</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;fno&minus;canonical&minus;system&minus;headers</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When preprocessing, do not
shorten system header paths with canonicalization.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;fpreprocessed</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Indicate to the preprocessor
that the input file has already been preprocessed. This
suppresses things like macro expansion, trigraph conversion,
escaped newline splicing, and processing of most directives.
The preprocessor still recognizes and removes comments, so
that you can pass a file preprocessed with <b>&minus;C</b>
to the compiler without problems. In this mode the
integrated preprocessor is little more than a tokenizer for
the front ends.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;fpreprocessed</b>
is implicit if the input file has one of the extensions
<b>.i</b>, <b>.ii</b> or <b>.mi</b>. These are the
extensions that <small>GCC</small> uses for preprocessed
files created by <b>&minus;save&minus;temps</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;ftabstop=</b><i>width</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Set the distance between tab
stops. This helps the preprocessor report correct column
numbers in warnings or errors, even if tabs appear on the
line. If the value is less than 1 or greater than 100, the
option is ignored. The default is 8.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;fdebug&minus;cpp</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This option is only useful for
debugging <small>GCC.</small> When used with
<b>&minus;E</b>, dumps debugging information about location
maps. Every token in the output is preceded by the dump of
the map its location belongs to. The dump of the map holding
the location of a token would be:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">        {&quot;P&quot;:F&lt;/file/path&gt;;&quot;F&quot;:F&lt;/includer/path&gt;;&quot;L&quot;:&lt;line_num&gt;;&quot;C&quot;:&lt;col_num&gt;;&quot;S&quot;:&lt;system_header_p&gt;;&quot;M&quot;:&lt;map_address&gt;;&quot;E&quot;:&lt;macro_expansion_p&gt;,&quot;loc&quot;:&lt;location&gt;}</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">When used
without <b>&minus;E</b>, this option has no effect.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;ftrack&minus;macro&minus;expansion</b>[<b>=</b><i>level</i>]</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Track locations of tokens
across macro expansions. This allows the compiler to emit
diagnostic about the current macro expansion stack when a
compilation error occurs in a macro expansion. Using this
option makes the preprocessor and the compiler consume more
memory. The <i>level</i> parameter can be used to choose the
level of precision of token location tracking thus
decreasing the memory consumption if necessary. Value
<b>0</b> of <i>level</i> de-activates this option just as if
no <b>&minus;ftrack&minus;macro&minus;expansion</b> was
present on the command line. Value <b>1</b> tracks tokens
locations in a degraded mode for the sake of minimal memory
overhead. In this mode all tokens resulting from the
expansion of an argument of a function-like macro have the
same location. Value <b>2</b> tracks tokens locations
completely. This value is the most memory hungry. When this
option is given no argument, the default parameter value is
<b>2</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
&minus;ftrack&minus;macro&minus;expansion=2 is activated by
default.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;fexec&minus;charset=</b><i>charset</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Set the execution character
set, used for string and character constants. The default is
<small>UTF&minus;8.</small> <i>charset</i> can be any
encoding supported by the system&rsquo;s
<tt>&quot;iconv&quot;</tt> library routine.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;fwide&minus;exec&minus;charset=</b><i>charset</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Set the wide execution
character set, used for wide string and character constants.
The default is <small>UTF&minus;32</small> or
<small>UTF&minus;16,</small> whichever corresponds to the
width of <tt>&quot;wchar_t&quot;</tt>. As with
<b>&minus;fexec&minus;charset</b>, <i>charset</i> can be any
encoding supported by the system&rsquo;s
<tt>&quot;iconv&quot;</tt> library routine; however, you
will have problems with encodings that do not fit exactly in
<tt>&quot;wchar_t&quot;</tt>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;finput&minus;charset=</b><i>charset</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Set the input character set,
used for translation from the character set of the input
file to the source character set used by <small>GCC.</small>
If the locale does not specify, or <small>GCC</small> cannot
get this information from the locale, the default is
<small>UTF&minus;8.</small> This can be overridden by either
the locale or this command line option. Currently the
command line option takes precedence if there&rsquo;s a
conflict. <i>charset</i> can be any encoding supported by
the system&rsquo;s <tt>&quot;iconv&quot;</tt> library
routine.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;fworking&minus;directory</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Enable generation of
linemarkers in the preprocessor output that will let the
compiler know the current working directory at the time of
preprocessing. When this option is enabled, the preprocessor
will emit, after the initial linemarker, a second linemarker
with the current working directory followed by two slashes.
<small>GCC</small> will use this directory, when it&rsquo;s
present in the preprocessed input, as the directory emitted
as the current working directory in some debugging
information formats. This option is implicitly enabled if
debugging information is enabled, but this can be inhibited
with the negated form
<b>&minus;fno&minus;working&minus;directory</b>. If the
<b>&minus;P</b> flag is present in the command line, this
option has no effect, since no <tt>&quot;#line&quot;</tt>
directives are emitted whatsoever.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;fno&minus;show&minus;column</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Do not print column numbers in
diagnostics. This may be necessary if diagnostics are being
scanned by a program that does not understand the column
numbers, such as <b>dejagnu</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;A</b>
<i>predicate</i><b>=</b><i>answer</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Make an assertion with the
predicate <i>predicate</i> and answer <i>answer</i>. This
form is preferred to the older form <b>&minus;A</b>
<i>predicate</i><b>(</b><i>answer</i><b>)</b>, which is
still supported, because it does not use shell special
characters.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;A
&minus;</b><i>predicate</i><b>=</b><i>answer</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Cancel an assertion with the
predicate <i>predicate</i> and answer <i>answer</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;dCHARS</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><i><small>CHARS</small></i> is
a sequence of one or more of the following characters, and
must not be preceded by a space. Other characters are
interpreted by the compiler proper, or reserved for future
versions of <small>GCC,</small> and so are silently ignored.
If you specify characters whose behavior conflicts, the
result is undefined.</p>

<h2>ENVIRONMENT
<a name="ENVIRONMENT"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This section
describes the environment variables that affect how
<small>CPP</small> operates. You can use them to specify
directories or prefixes to use when searching for include
files, or to control dependency output.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that you
can also specify places to search using options such as
<b>&minus;I</b>, and control dependency output with options
like <b>&minus;M</b>. These take precedence over environment
variables, which in turn take precedence over the
configuration of <small>GCC. <b><br>
CPATH</b></small> <b><br>
C_INCLUDE_PATH <small><br>
CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH <br>
OBJC_INCLUDE_PATH</small></b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Each variable&rsquo;s value is
a list of directories separated by a special character, much
like <b><small>PATH</small></b> , in which to look for
header files. The special character,
<tt>&quot;PATH_SEPARATOR&quot;</tt>, is target-dependent and
determined at <small>GCC</small> build time. For Microsoft
Windows-based targets it is a semicolon, and for almost all
other targets it is a colon.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><b><small>CPATH</small></b>
specifies a list of directories to be searched as if
specified with <b>&minus;I</b>, but after any paths given
with <b>&minus;I</b> options on the command line. This
environment variable is used regardless of which language is
being preprocessed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The remaining
environment variables apply only when preprocessing the
particular language indicated. Each specifies a list of
directories to be searched as if specified with
<b>&minus;isystem</b>, but after any paths given with
<b>&minus;isystem</b> options on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">In all these
variables, an empty element instructs the compiler to search
its current working directory. Empty elements can appear at
the beginning or end of a path. For instance, if the value
of <b><small>CPATH</small></b> is
<tt>&quot;:/special/include&quot;</tt>, that has the same
effect as
<b>&minus;I.&nbsp;&minus;I/special/include</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b><small>DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT</small></b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">If this variable is set, its
value specifies how to output dependencies for Make based on
the non-system header files processed by the compiler.
System header files are ignored in the dependency
output.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The value of
<b><small>DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT</small></b> can be just a file
name, in which case the Make rules are written to that file,
guessing the target name from the source file name. Or the
value can have the form <i>file target</i>, in which case
the rules are written to file <i>file</i> using
<i>target</i> as the target name.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">In other words,
this environment variable is equivalent to combining the
options <b>&minus;MM</b> and <b>&minus;MF</b>, with an
optional <b>&minus;MT</b> switch too.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b><small>SUNPRO_DEPENDENCIES</small></b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This variable is the same as
<b><small>DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT</small></b> (see above),
except that system header files are not ignored, so it
implies <b>&minus;M</b> rather than <b>&minus;MM</b>.
However, the dependence on the main input file is
omitted.</p>
