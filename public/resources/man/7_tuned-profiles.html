<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">tuned&minus;profiles
- description of basic tuned profiles</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These are the
base profiles which are mostly shipped in the base tuned
package. They are targeted to various goals. Mostly they
provide performance optimizations but there are also
profiles targeted to low power consumption, low latency and
others. You can mostly deduce the purpose of the profile by
its name or you can see full description bellow.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The profiles
are stored in subdirectories below <i>/usr/lib/tuned</i>. If
you need to customize the profiles, you can copy them to
<i>/etc/tuned</i> and modify them as you need. When loading
profiles with the same name, the /etc/tuned takes
precedence. In such case you will not lose your customized
profiles between tuned updates.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The power
saving profiles contain settings that are typically not
enabled by default as they will noticeably impact the
latency/performance of your system as opposed to the power
saving mechanisms that are enabled by default. On the other
hand the performance profiles disable the additional power
saving mechanisms of tuned as they would negatively impact
throughput or latency.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">At the moment
we&rsquo;re providing the following pre&minus;defined
profiles: <b><br>
balanced</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">It is the default profile. It
provides balanced power saving and performance. At the
moment it enables CPU and disk plugins of tuned and it makes
sure the ondemand governor is active (if supported by the
current cpufreq driver). It enables ALPM power saving for
SATA host adapters and sets the link power management policy
to medium_power. It also sets the CPU energy performance
bias to normal. It also enables AC97 audio power saving or
(it depends on your system) HDA&minus;Intel power savings
with 10 seconds timeout. In case your system contains
supported Radeon graphics card (with enabled KMS) it
configures it to automatic power saving.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>powersave</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Maximal power saving, at the
moment it enables USB autosuspend (in case environment
variable USB_AUTOSUSPEND is set to 1), enables ALPM power
saving for SATA host adapters and sets the link power
manamgent policy to min_power. It also enables WiFi power
saving, enables multi core power savings scheduler for low
wakeup systems and makes sure the ondemand governor is
active (if supported by the current cpufreq driver). It sets
the CPU energy performance bias to powersave. It also
enables AC97 audio power saving or (it depends on your
system) HDA&minus;Intel power savings (with 10 seconds
timeout). In case your system contains supported Radeon
graphics card (with enabled KMS) it configures it to
automatic power saving. On Asus Eee PCs dynamic Super Hybrid
Engine is enabled.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>throughput&minus;performance</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Profile for typical throughput
performance tuning. Disables power saving mechanisms and
enables sysctl settings that improve the throughput
performance of your disk and network IO. CPU governor is set
to performance and CPU energy performance bias is set to
performance. Disk readahead values are increased.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>latency&minus;performance</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Profile for low latency
performance tuning. Disables power saving mechanisms. CPU
governor is set to performance andlocked to the low C states
(by PM QoS). CPU energy performance bias to performance.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>network&minus;throughput</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Profile for throughput network
tuning. It is based on the throughput&minus;performance
profile. It additionaly increases kernel network
buffers.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>network&minus;latency</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Profile for low latency network
tuning. It is based on the latency&minus;performance
profile. It additionaly disables transparent hugepages, NUMA
balancing and tunes several other network related sysctl
parameters.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>desktop</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Profile optimized for desktops
based on balanced profile. It additionaly enables scheduler
autogroups for better response of interactive
applications.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>virtual&minus;guest</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Profile optimized for virtual
guests based on throughput&minus;performance profile. It
additionally decreases virtual memory swappiness and
increases dirty_ratio settings.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>virtual&minus;host</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Profile optimized for virtual
hosts based on throughput&minus;performance profile. It
additionally enables more aggresive writeback of dirty
pages.</p>
