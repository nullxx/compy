&minus; programmer&rsquo;s view of character sets and
internationalization</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Linux is an
international operating system. Various of its utilities and
device drivers (including the console driver) support
multilingual character sets including Latin-alphabet letters
with diacritical marks, accents, ligatures, and entire
non-Latin alphabets including Greek, Cyrillic, Arabic, and
Hebrew.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This manual
page presents a programmer&rsquo;s-eye view of different
character-set standards and how they fit together on Linux.
Standards discussed include ASCII, ISO 8859, KOI8-R,
Unicode, ISO 2022 and ISO 4873. The primary emphasis is on
character sets actually used as locale character sets, not
the myriad others that can be found in data from other
systems.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A complete list
of charsets used in an officially supported locale in glibc
2.2.3 is: ISO-8859-{1,2,3,5,6,7,8,9,13,15}, CP1251, UTF-8,
EUC-{KR,JP,TW}, KOI8-{R,U}, GB2312, GB18030, GBK, BIG5,
BIG5-HKSCS and TIS-620 (in no particular order.) (Romanian
may be switching to ISO-8859-16.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>ASCII</b>
<br>
ASCII (American Standard Code For Information Interchange)
is the original 7-bit character set, originally designed for
American English. It is currently described by the ECMA-6
standard.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Various ASCII
variants replacing the dollar sign with other currency
symbols and replacing punctuation with non-English
alphabetic characters to cover German, French, Spanish and
others in 7 bits exist. All are deprecated; glibc
doesn&rsquo;t support locales whose character sets
aren&rsquo;t true supersets of ASCII. (These sets are also
known as ISO-646, a close relative of ASCII that permitted
replacing these characters.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As Linux was
written for hardware designed in the US, it natively
supports ASCII.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>ISO 8859</b>
<br>
ISO 8859 is a series of 15 8-bit character sets all of which
have US ASCII in their low (7-bit) half, invisible control
characters in positions 128 to 159, and 96 fixed-width
graphics in positions 160-255.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Of these, the
most important is ISO 8859-1 (Latin-1). It is natively
supported in the Linux console driver, fairly well supported
in X11R6, and is the base character set of HTML.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Console support
for the other 8859 character sets is available under Linux
through user-mode utilities (such as <b>setfont</b>(8)) that
modify keyboard bindings and the EGA graphics table and
employ the &quot;user mapping&quot; font table in the
console driver.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Here are brief
descriptions of each set: <br>
8859-1 (Latin-1)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Latin-1 covers most Western
European languages such as Albanian, Catalan, Danish, Dutch,
English, Faroese, Finnish, French, German, Galician, Irish,
Icelandic, Italian, Norwegian, Portuguese, Spanish, and
Swedish. The lack of the ligatures Dutch ij, French oe and
old-style ,,German&lsquo;&lsquo; quotation marks is
considered tolerable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">8859-2 (Latin-2)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Latin-2 supports most
Latin-written Slavic and Central European languages:
Croatian, Czech, German, Hungarian, Polish, Rumanian,
Slovak, and Slovene.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">8859-3 (Latin-3)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Latin-3 is popular with authors
of Esperanto, Galician, and Maltese. (Turkish is now written
with 8859-9 instead.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">8859-4 (Latin-4)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Latin-4 introduced letters for
Estonian, Latvian, and Lithuanian. It is essentially
obsolete; see 8859-10 (Latin-6) and 8859-13 (Latin-7).</p>

<p>8859-5</p></td>

<p>Cyrillic letters supporting Bulgarian, Byelorussian,
Macedonian, Russian, Serbian and Ukrainian. Ukrainians read
the letter &quot;ghe&quot; with downstroke as
&quot;heh&quot; and would need a ghe with upstroke to write
a correct ghe. See the discussion of KOI8-R below.</p></td></tr>

of separate letter forms, but a proper display engine should
combine these using the proper initial, medial, and final
forms.</p> </td></tr>

signs). Niqud and full-fledged Biblical Hebrew are outside
the scope of this character set; under Linux, UTF-8 is the
preferred encoding for these.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">8859-9 (Latin-5)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This is a variant of Latin-1
that replaces Icelandic letters with Turkish ones.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">8859-10 (Latin-6)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Latin 6 adds the last Inuit
(Greenlandic) and Sami (Lappish) letters that were missing
in Latin 4 to cover the entire Nordic area. RFC 1345 listed
a preliminary and different &quot;latin6&quot;. Skolt Sami
still needs a few more accents than these.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">8859-11</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This exists only as a rejected
draft standard. The draft standard was identical to TIS-620,
which is used under Linux for Thai.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">8859-12</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This set does not exist. While
Vietnamese has been suggested for this space, it does not
fit within the 96 (noncombining) characters ISO 8859 offers.
UTF-8 is the preferred character set for Vietnamese use
under Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">8859-13 (Latin-7)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Supports the Baltic Rim
languages; in particular, it includes Latvian characters not
found in Latin-4.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">8859-14 (Latin-8)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This is the Celtic character
set, covering Gaelic and Welsh. This charset also contains
the dotted characters needed for Old Irish.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">8859-15 (Latin-9)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This adds the Euro sign and
French and Finnish letters that were missing in Latin-1.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">8859-16 (Latin-10)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This set covers many of the
languages covered by 8859-2, and supports Romanian more
completely then that set does.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>KOI8-R</b>
<br>
KOI8-R is a non-ISO character set popular in Russia. The
lower half is US ASCII; the upper is a Cyrillic character
set somewhat better designed than ISO 8859-5. KOI8-U is a
common character set, based off KOI8-R, that has better
support for Ukrainian. Neither of these sets are ISO-2022
compatible, unlike the ISO-8859 series.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Console support
for KOI8-R is available under Linux through user-mode
utilities that modify keyboard bindings and the EGA graphics
table, and employ the &quot;user mapping&quot; font table in
the console driver.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>JIS X
0208</b> <br>
JIS X 0208 is a Japanese national standard character set.
Though there are some more Japanese national standard
character sets (like JIS X 0201, JIS X 0212, and JIS X
0213), this is the most important one. Characters are mapped
into a 94x94 two-byte matrix, whose each byte is in the
range 0x21-0x7e. Note that JIS X 0208 is a character set,
not an encoding. This means that JIS X 0208 itself is not
used for expressing text data. JIS X 0208 is used as a
component to construct encodings such as EUC-JP, Shift_JIS,
and ISO-2022-JP. EUC-JP is the most important encoding for
Linux and includes US ASCII and JIS X 0208. In EUC-JP, JIS X
0208 characters are expressed in two bytes, each of which is
the JIS X 0208 code plus 0x80.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>KS X
1001</b> <br>
KS X 1001 is a Korean national standard character set. Just
as JIS X 0208, characters are mapped into a 94x94 two-byte
matrix. KS X 1001 is used like JIS X 0208, as a component to
construct encodings such as EUC-KR, Johab, and ISO-2022-KR.
EUC-KR is the most important encoding for Linux and includes
US ASCII and KS X 1001. KS C 5601 is an older name for KS X
1001.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>GB 2312</b>
<br>
GB 2312 is a mainland Chinese national standard character
set used to express simplified Chinese. Just like JIS X
0208, characters are mapped into a 94x94 two-byte matrix
used to construct EUC-CN. EUC-CN is the most important
encoding for Linux and includes US ASCII and GB 2312. Note
that EUC-CN is often called as GB, GB 2312, or CN-GB.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Big5</b>
<br>
Big5 is a popular character set in Taiwan to express
traditional Chinese. (Big5 is both a character set and an
encoding.) It is a superset of US ASCII. Non-ASCII
characters are expressed in two bytes. Bytes 0xa1-0xfe are
used as leading bytes for two-byte characters. Big5 and its
extension is widely used in Taiwan and Hong Kong. It is not
ISO 2022-compliant.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>TIS 620</b>
<br>
TIS 620 is a Thai national standard character set and a
superset of US ASCII. Like ISO 8859 series, Thai characters
are mapped into 0xa1-0xfe. TIS 620 is the only commonly used
character set under Linux besides UTF-8 to have combining
characters.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>UNICODE</b>
<br>
Unicode (ISO 10646) is a standard which aims to
unambiguously represent every character in every human
language. Unicode&rsquo;s structure permits 20.1 bits to
encode every character. Since most computers don&rsquo;t
include 20.1-bit integers, Unicode is usually encoded as
32-bit integers internally and either a series of 16-bit
integers (UTF-16) (needing two 16-bit integers only when
encoding certain rare characters) or a series of 8-bit bytes
(UTF-8). Information on Unicode is available at
<a href="http://www.unicode.org">http://www.unicode.org</a>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Linux
represents Unicode using the 8-bit Unicode Transformation
Format (UTF-8). UTF-8 is a variable length encoding of
Unicode. It uses 1 byte to code 7 bits, 2 bytes for 11 bits,
3 bytes for 16 bits, 4 bytes for 21 bits, 5 bytes for 26
bits, 6 bytes for 31 bits.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Let 0,1,x stand
for a zero, one, or arbitrary bit. A byte 0xxxxxxx stands
for the Unicode 00000000 0xxxxxxx which codes the same
symbol as the ASCII 0xxxxxxx. Thus, ASCII goes unchanged
into UTF-8, and people using only ASCII do not notice any
change: not in code, and not in file size.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A byte 110xxxxx
is the start of a 2-byte code, and 110xxxxx 10yyyyyy is
assembled into 00000xxx xxyyyyyy. A byte 1110xxxx is the
start of a 3-byte code, and 1110xxxx 10yyyyyy 10zzzzzz is
assembled into xxxxyyyy yyzzzzzz. (When UTF-8 is used to
code the 31-bit ISO 10646 then this progression continues up
to 6-byte codes.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For most people
who use ISO-8859 character sets, this means that the
characters outside of ASCII are now coded with two bytes.
This tends to expand ordinary text files by only one or two
percent. For Russian or Greek users, this expands ordinary
text files by 100%, since text in those languages is mostly
outside of ASCII. For Japanese users this means that the
16-bit codes now in common use will take three bytes. While
there are algorithmic conversions from some character sets
(especially ISO-8859-1) to Unicode, general conversion
requires carrying around conversion tables, which can be
quite large for 16-bit codes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that UTF-8
is self-synchronizing: 10xxxxxx is a tail, any other byte is
the head of a code. Note that the only way ASCII bytes occur
in a UTF-8 stream, is as themselves. In particular, there
are no embedded NULs ('\0') or '/'s that form part of some
larger code.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Since ASCII,
and, in particular, NUL and '/', are unchanged, the kernel
does not notice that UTF-8 is being used. It does not care
at all what the bytes it is handling stand for.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Rendering of
Unicode data streams is typically handled through
&quot;subfont&quot; tables which map a subset of Unicode to
glyphs. Internally the kernel uses Unicode to describe the
subfont loaded in video RAM. This means that in UTF-8 mode
one can use a character set with 512 different symbols. This
is not enough for Japanese, Chinese and Korean, but it is
enough for most other purposes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">At the current
time, the console driver does not handle combining
characters. So Thai, Sioux and any other script needing
combining characters can&rsquo;t be handled on the
console.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>ISO 2022 and
ISO 4873</b> <br>
The ISO 2022 and 4873 standards describe a font-control
model based on VT100 practice. This model is (partially)
supported by the Linux kernel and by <b>xterm</b>(1). It is
popular in Japan and Korea.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There are 4
graphic character sets, called G0, G1, G2 and G3, and one of
them is the current character set for codes with high bit
zero (initially G0), and one of them is the current
character set for codes with high bit one (initially G1).
Each graphic character set has 94 or 96 characters, and is
essentially a 7-bit character set. It uses codes either
040-0177 (041-0176) or 0240-0377 (0241-0376). G0 always has
size 94 and uses codes 041-0176.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Switching
between character sets is done using the shift functions
<b>^N</b> (SO or LS1), <b>^O</b> (SI or LS0), ESC n (LS2),
ESC o (LS3), ESC N (SS2), ESC O (SS3), ESC ~ (LS1R), ESC }
(LS2R), ESC | (LS3R). The function LS<i>n</i> makes
character set G<i>n</i> the current one for codes with high
bit zero. The function LS<i>n</i>R makes character set
G<i>n</i> the current one for codes with high bit one. The
function SS<i>n</i> makes character set G<i>n</i>
(<i>n</i>=2 or 3) the current one for the next character
only (regardless of the value of its high order bit).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A 94-character
set is designated as G<i>n</i> character set by an escape
sequence ESC ( xx (for G0), ESC ) xx (for G1), ESC * xx (for
G2), ESC + xx (for G3), where xx is a symbol or a pair of
symbols found in the ISO 2375 International Register of
Coded Character Sets. For example, ESC ( @ selects the ISO
646 character set as G0, ESC ( A selects the UK standard
character set (with pound instead of number sign), ESC ( B
selects ASCII (with dollar instead of currency sign), ESC (
M selects a character set for African languages, ESC ( ! A
selects the Cuban character set, and so on.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A 96-character
set is designated as G<i>n</i> character set by an escape
sequence ESC &minus; xx (for G1), ESC . xx (for G2) or ESC /
xx (for G3). For example, ESC &minus; G selects the Hebrew
alphabet as G1.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A multibyte
character set is designated as G<i>n</i> character set by an
escape sequence ESC $ xx or ESC $ ( xx (for G0), ESC $ ) xx
(for G1), ESC $ * xx (for G2), ESC $ + xx (for G3). For
example, ESC $ ( C selects the Korean character set for G0.
The Japanese character set selected by ESC $ B has a more
recent version selected by ESC &amp; @ ESC $ B.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">ISO 4873
stipulates a narrower use of character sets, where G0 is
fixed (always ASCII), so that G1, G2 and G3 can be invoked
only for codes with the high order bit set. In particular,
<b>^N</b> and <b>^O</b> are not used anymore, ESC ( xx can
be used only with xx=B, and ESC ) xx, ESC * xx, ESC + xx are
equivalent to ESC &minus; xx, ESC . xx, ESC / xx,
respectively.</p>
