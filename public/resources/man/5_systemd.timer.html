&minus; Timer unit configuration</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>timer</i>.timer</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A unit
configuration file whose name ends in &quot;.timer&quot;
encodes information about a timer controlled and supervised
by systemd, for timer&minus;based activation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This man page
lists the configuration options specific to this unit type.
See <b>systemd.unit</b>(5) for the common options of all
unit configuration files. The common configuration items are
configured in the generic [Unit] and [Install] sections. The
timer specific configuration options are configured in the
[Timer] section.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For each timer
file, a matching unit file must exist, describing the unit
to activate when the timer elapses. By default, a service by
the same name as the timer (except for the suffix) is
activated. Example: a timer file foo.timer activates a
matching service foo.service. The unit to activate may be
controlled by <i>Unit=</i> (see below).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Unless
<i>DefaultDependencies=</i> is set to <b>false</b>, all
timer units will implicitly have dependencies of type
<i>Conflicts=</i> and <i>Before=</i> on shutdown.target to
ensure that they are stopped cleanly prior to system
shutdown. Timer units with at least one <i>OnCalendar=</i>
directive will have an additional <i>After=</i> dependency
on timer&minus;sync.target to avoid being started before the
system clock has been correctly set. Only timer units
involved with early boot or late system shutdown should
disable the <i>DefaultDependencies=</i> option.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Timer files
must include a [Timer] section, which carries information
about the timer it defines. The options specific to the
[Timer] section of timer units are the following:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>OnActiveSec=</i>,
<i>OnBootSec=</i>, <i>OnStartupSec=</i>,
<i>OnUnitActiveSec=</i>, <i>OnUnitInactiveSec=</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Defines monotonic timers
relative to different starting points: <i>OnActiveSec=</i>
defines a timer relative to the moment the timer itself is
activated. <i>OnBootSec=</i> defines a timer relative to
when the machine was booted up. <i>OnStartupSec=</i> defines
a timer relative to when systemd was first started.
<i>OnUnitActiveSec=</i> defines a timer relative to when the
unit the timer is activating was last activated.
<i>OnUnitInactiveSec=</i> defines a timer relative to when
the unit the timer is activating was last deactivated.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Multiple
directives may be combined of the same and of different
types. For example, by combining <i>OnBootSec=</i> and
<i>OnUnitActiveSec=</i>, it is possible to define a timer
that elapses in regular intervals and activates a specific
service each time.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The arguments
to the directives are time spans configured in seconds.
Example: &quot;OnBootSec=50&quot; means 50s after
boot&minus;up. The argument may also include time units.
Example: &quot;OnBootSec=5h 30min&quot; means 5 hours and 30
minutes after boot&minus;up. For details about the syntax of
time spans, see <b>systemd.unit</b>(5).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If a timer
configured with <i>OnBootSec=</i> or <i>OnStartupSec=</i> is
already in the past when the timer unit is activated, it
will immediately elapse and the configured unit is started.
This is not the case for timers defined in the other
directives.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">These are
monotonic timers, independent of wall&minus;clock time and
timezones. If the computer is temporarily suspended, the
monotonic clock stops too.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If the empty
string is assigned to any of these options, the list of
timers is reset, and all prior assignments will have no
effect.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
timers do not necessarily expire at the precise time
configured with these settings, as they are subject to the
<i>AccuracySec=</i> setting below.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>OnCalendar=</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Defines realtime (i.e.
wallclock) timers with calendar event expressions. See
<b>systemd.time</b>(7) for more information on the syntax of
calendar event expressions. Otherwise, the semantics are
similar to <i>OnActiveSec=</i> and related settings.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
timers do not necessarily expire at the precise time
configured with this setting, as it is subject to the
<i>AccuracySec=</i> setting below.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>AccuracySec=</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Specify the accuracy the timer
shall elapse with. Defaults to 1min. The timer is scheduled
to elapse within a time window starting with the time
specified in <i>OnCalendar=</i>, <i>OnActiveSec=</i>,
<i>OnBootSec=</i>, <i>OnStartupSec=</i>,
<i>OnUnitActiveSec=</i> or <i>OnUnitInactiveSec=</i> and
ending the time configured with <i>AccuracySec=</i> later.
Within this time window, the expiry time will be placed at a
host&minus;specific, randomized but stable position that is
synchronized between all local timer units. This is done in
order to distribute the wake&minus;up time in networked
installations, as well as optimizing power consumption to
suppress unnecessary CPU wake&minus;ups. To get best
accuracy, set this option to 1us. Note that the timer is
still subject to the timer slack configured via
<b>systemd-system.conf</b>(5)'s <i>TimerSlackNSec=</i>
setting. See <b>prctl</b>(2) for details. To optimize power
consumption, make sure to set this value as high as possible
and as low as necessary.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Unit=</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The unit to activate when this
timer elapses. The argument is a unit name, whose suffix is
not &quot;.timer&quot;. If not specified, this value
defaults to a service that has the same name as the timer
unit, except for the suffix. (See above.) It is recommended
that the unit name that is activated and the unit name of
the timer unit are named identically, except for the
suffix.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Persistent=</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Takes a boolean argument. If
true, the time when the service unit was last triggered is
stored on disk. When the timer is activated, the service
unit is triggered immediately if it would have been
triggered at least once during the time when the timer was
inactive. This is useful to catch up on missed runs of the
service when the machine was off. Note that this setting
only has an effect on timers configured with
<i>OnCalendar=</i>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>WakeSystem=</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Takes a boolean argument. If
true, an elapsing timer will cause the system to resume from
suspend, should it be suspended and if the system supports
this. Note that this option will only make sure the system
resumes on the appropriate times, it will not take care of
suspending it again after any work that is to be done is
finished. Defaults to <i>false</i>.</p>
