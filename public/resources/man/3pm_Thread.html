<h2>NAME
<a name="NAME"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Thread &minus;
Manipulate threads in Perl (for old code only)</p>

<h2>DEPRECATED
<a name="DEPRECATED"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<tt>&quot;Thread&quot;</tt> module served as the frontend to
the old-style thread model, called <i>5005threads</i>, that
was introduced in release 5.005. That model was deprecated,
and has been removed in version 5.10.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For old code
and interim backwards compatibility, the
<tt>&quot;Thread&quot;</tt> module has been reworked to
function as a frontend for the new interpreter threads
(<i>ithreads</i>) model. However, some previous
functionality is not available. Further, the data sharing
models between the two thread models are completely
different, and anything to do with data sharing has to be
thought differently. With <i>ithreads</i>, you must
explicitly <tt>&quot;share()&quot;</tt> variables between
the threads.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You are
strongly encouraged to migrate any existing threaded code to
the new model (i.e., use the <tt>&quot;threads&quot;</tt>
and <tt>&quot;threads::shared&quot;</tt> modules) as soon as
possible.</p>

<h2>HISTORY
<a name="HISTORY"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In Perl 5.005,
the thread model was that all data is implicitly shared, and
shared access to data has to be explicitly synchronized.
This model is called <i>5005threads</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In Perl 5.6, a
new model was introduced in which all is was thread local
and shared access to data has to be explicitly declared.
This model is called <i>ithreads</i>, for &quot;interpreter
threads&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In Perl 5.6,
the <i>ithreads</i> model was not available as a public
<small>API</small> ; only as an internal <small>API</small>
that was available for extension writers, and to implement
<i>fork()</i> emulation on Win32 platforms.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In Perl 5.8,
the <i>ithreads</i> model became available through the
<tt>&quot;threads&quot;</tt> module, and the
<i>5005threads</i> model was deprecated.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In Perl 5.10,
the <i>5005threads</i> model was removed from the Perl
interpreter.</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS

    my $t = Thread&minus;&gt;new(\&amp;start_sub, @start_args);

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<tt>&quot;Thread&quot;</tt> module provides multithreading
support for Perl.</p>

<h2>FUNCTIONS
<a name="FUNCTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$thread =
Thread&minus;&gt;new(\&amp;start_sub) <br>
$thread = Thread&minus;&gt;new(\&amp;start_sub,
<small>LIST</small> )</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;"><tt>&quot;new&quot;</tt> starts
a new thread of execution in the referenced subroutine. The
optional list is passed as parameters to the subroutine.
Execution continues in both the subroutine and the code
after the <tt>&quot;new&quot;</tt> call.</p>


<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em"><tt>&quot;Thread&minus;&amp;gt;new&quot;</tt>
returns a thread object representing the newly created
thread.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">lock
<small>VARIABLE</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;"><tt>&quot;lock&quot;</tt>
places a lock on a variable until the lock goes out of
scope.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">If the variable
is locked by another thread, the <tt>&quot;lock&quot;</tt>
call will block until it&rsquo;s available.
<tt>&quot;lock&quot;</tt> is recursive, so multiple calls to
<tt>&quot;lock&quot;</tt> are safe--the variable will remain
locked until the outermost lock on the variable goes out of
scope.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">Locks on
variables only affect <tt>&quot;lock&quot;</tt> calls--they
do <i>not</i> affect normal access to a variable. (Locks on
subs are different, and covered in a bit.) If you really,
<i>really</i> want locks to block access, then go ahead and
tie them to something and manage this yourself. This is done
on purpose. While managing access to variables is a good
thing, Perl doesn&rsquo;t force you out of its living
room...</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">If a container
object, such as a hash or array, is locked, all the elements
of that container are not locked. For example, if a thread
does a <tt>&quot;lock @a&quot;</tt>, any other thread doing
a <tt>&quot;lock($a[12])&quot;</tt> won&rsquo;t block.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">Finally,
<tt>&quot;lock&quot;</tt> will traverse up references
exactly <i>one</i> level. <tt>&quot;lock(\$a)&quot;</tt> is
equivalent to <tt>&quot;lock($a)&quot;</tt>, while
<tt>&quot;lock(\\$a)&quot;</tt> is not.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">async <small>BLOCK</small>
;</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;"><tt>&quot;async&quot;</tt>
creates a thread to execute the block immediately following
it. This block is treated as an anonymous sub, and so must
have a semi-colon after the closing brace. Like
<tt>&quot;Thread&minus;&amp;gt;new&quot;</tt>,
<tt>&quot;async&quot;</tt> returns a thread object.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Thread&minus;&gt;self</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">The
<tt>&quot;Thread&minus;&gt;self&quot;</tt> function returns
a thread object that represents the thread making the
<tt>&quot;Thread&minus;&gt;self&quot;</tt> call.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Thread&minus;&gt;list</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">Returns a list of all
non-joined, non-detached Thread objects.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">cond_wait
<small>VARIABLE</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">The
<tt>&quot;cond_wait&quot;</tt> function takes a
<b>locked</b> variable as a parameter, unlocks the variable,
and blocks until another thread does a
<tt>&quot;cond_signal&quot;</tt> or
<tt>&quot;cond_broadcast&quot;</tt> for that same locked
variable. The variable that <tt>&quot;cond_wait&quot;</tt>
blocked on is relocked after the
<tt>&quot;cond_wait&quot;</tt> is satisfied. If there are
multiple threads <tt>&quot;cond_wait&quot;</tt>ing on the
same variable, all but one will reblock waiting to reaquire
the lock on the variable. (So if you&rsquo;re only using
<tt>&quot;cond_wait&quot;</tt> for synchronization, give up
the lock as soon as possible.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">cond_signal
<small>VARIABLE</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">The
<tt>&quot;cond_signal&quot;</tt> function takes a locked
variable as a parameter and unblocks one thread that&rsquo;s
<tt>&quot;cond_wait&quot;</tt>ing on that variable. If more
than one thread is blocked in a
<tt>&quot;cond_wait&quot;</tt> on that variable, only one
(and which one is indeterminate) will be unblocked.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">If there are no
threads blocked in a <tt>&quot;cond_wait&quot;</tt> on the
variable, the signal is discarded.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">cond_broadcast
<small>VARIABLE</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">The
<tt>&quot;cond_broadcast&quot;</tt> function works similarly
to <tt>&quot;cond_signal&quot;</tt>.
<tt>&quot;cond_broadcast&quot;</tt>, though, will unblock
<b>all</b> the threads that are blocked in a
<tt>&quot;cond_wait&quot;</tt> on the locked variable,
rather than only one.</p>
