_________________________________________________________________</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This command
provides information about various internals of the Tcl
interpreter. The legal <i>option</i>s (which may be
abbreviated) are: <b><br>
info args</b> <i>procname</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Returns a list containing the
names of the arguments to procedure <i>procname</i>, in
order. <i>Procname</i> must be the name of a Tcl command
procedure.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>info body</b>
<i>procname</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Returns the body of procedure
<i>procname</i>. <i>Procname</i> must be the name of a Tcl
command procedure.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>info cmdcount</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Returns a count of the total
number of commands that have been invoked in this
interpreter.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>info commands</b>
?<i>pattern</i>?</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If <i>pattern</i> is not
specified, returns a list of names of all the
<big>&#9474;</big> Tcl commands visible (i.e. executable
without using a qualified <big>&#9474;</big> name) to the
current namespace, including both the built-in
<big>&#9474;</big> commands written in C and the command
procedures defined using <big>&#9474;</big> the <b>proc</b>
command. If <i>pattern</i> is specified, only those names
<big>&#9474;</big> matching <i>pattern</i> are returned.
Matching is determined using the <big>&#9474;</big> same
rules as for <b>string match</b>. <i>pattern</i> can be a
qualified name <big>&#9474;</big> like <b>Foo::print*</b>.
That is, it may specify a particular <big>&#9474;</big>
namespace using a sequence of namespace names separated by
<big>&#9474;</big> double colons (<b>::</b>), and may have
pattern matching special <big>&#9474;</big> characters at
the end to specify a set of commands in that
<big>&#9474;</big> namespace. If <i>pattern</i> is a
qualified name, the resulting list <big>&#9474;</big> of
command names has each one qualified with the name of the
<big>&#9474;</big> specified namespace, and only the
commands defined in the named <big>&#9474;</big> namespace
are returned.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>info complete</b>
<i>command</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Returns 1 if <i>command</i> is
a complete Tcl command in the sense of having no unclosed
quotes, braces, brackets or array element names. If the
command does not appear to be complete then 0 is returned.
This command is typically used in line-oriented input
environments to allow users to type in commands that span
multiple lines; if the command is not complete, the script
can delay evaluating it until additional lines have been
typed to complete the command.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>info default</b> <i>procname
arg varname</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><i>Procname</i> must be the
name of a Tcl command procedure and <i>arg</i> must be the
name of an argument to that procedure. If <i>arg</i> does
not have a default value then the command returns <b>0</b>.
Otherwise it returns <b>1</b> and places the default value
of <i>arg</i> into variable <i>varname</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>info exists</b>
<i>varName</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Returns <b>1</b> if the
variable named <i>varName</i> exists in the current context
(either as a global or local variable) and has been defined
by being given a value, returns <b>0</b> otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>info frame</b>
?<i>number</i>?</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This command provides access to
all frames on the stack, even those hidden from <b>info
level</b>. If <i>number</i> is not specified, this command
returns a number giving the frame level of the command. This
is 1 if the command is invoked at top-level. If
<i>number</i> is specified, then the result is a dictionary
containing the location information for the command at the
<i>number</i>ed level on the stack.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If
<i>number</i> is positive (&gt; 0) then it selects a
particular stack level (1 refers to the top-most active
command, i.e., <b>info frame</b> itself, 2 to the command it
was called from, and so on); otherwise it gives a level
relative to the current command (0 refers to the current
command, i.e., <b>info frame</b> itself, -1 to its caller,
and so on).</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">This is similar
to how <b>info level</b> works, except that this subcommand
reports all frames, like <b>source</b>d scripts,
<b>eval</b>s, <b>uplevel</b>s, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Note that for
nested commands, like &ldquo;foo [bar [x]]&rdquo;, only
&ldquo;x&rdquo; will be seen by an <b>info frame</b> invoked
within &ldquo;x&rdquo;. This is the same as for <b>info
level</b> and error stack traces.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The result
dictionary may contain the keys listed below, with the
specified meanings for their values:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="22%"></td>
<td width="6%">


<p><b>type</b></p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="68%">


<p>This entry is always present and describes the nature of
the location for the command. The recognized values are
<b>source</b>, <b>proc</b>, <b>eval</b>, and
<b>precompiled</b>.</p> </td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:32%;"><b>source</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:43%;">means that the command is found
in a script loaded by the <b>source</b> command.</p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;"><b>proc</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:43%;">means that the command is found
in dynamically created procedure body.</p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;"><b>eval</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:43%;">means that the command is
executed by <b>eval</b> or <b>uplevel</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;"><b>precompiled</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:43%;">means that the command is found
in a precompiled script (loadable by the package
<b>tbcload</b>), and no further information will be
available.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="22%"></td>
<td width="9%">


<p><b>line</b></p></td>
<td width="1%"></td>
<td width="68%">


<p>This entry provides the number of the line the command
is at inside of the script it is a part of. This information
is not present for type <b>precompiled</b>. For type
<b>source</b> this information is counted relative to the
beginning of the file, whereas for the last two types the
line is counted relative to the start of the script.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="22%"></td>
<td width="9%">


<p><b>file</b></p></td>
<td width="1%"></td>
<td width="68%">


<p>This entry is present only for type <b>source</b>. It
provides the normalized path of the file the command is
in.</p> </td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="22%"></td>
<td width="9%">


<p><b>cmd</b></p></td>
<td width="1%"></td>
<td width="68%">


<p>This entry provides the string representation of the
command. This is usually the unsubstituted form, however for
commands which are a pure list executed by eval it is the
substituted form as they have no other string
representation. Care is taken that the pure-List property of
the latter is not spoiled.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="22%"></td>
<td width="9%">


<p><b>proc</b></p></td>
<td width="1%"></td>
<td width="68%">


<p>This entry is present only if the command is found in
the body of a regular Tcl procedure. It then provides the
name of that procedure.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="22%"></td>
<td width="9%">


<p><b>lambda</b></p></td>
<td width="1%"></td>
<td width="68%">


<p>This entry is present only if the command is found in
the body of an anonymous Tcl procedure, i.e. a lambda. It
then provides the entire definition of the lambda in
question.</p> </td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="22%"></td>
<td width="9%">


<p><b>level</b></p></td>
<td width="1%"></td>
<td width="68%">


<p>This entry is present only if the queried frame has a
corresponding frame returned by <b>info level</b>. It
provides the index of this frame, relative to the current
level (0 and negative numbers).</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">A thing of note
is that for procedures statically defined in files the
locations of commands in their bodies will be reported with
type <b>source</b> and absolute line numbers, and not as
type <b>proc</b>. The same is true for procedures nested in
statically defined procedures, and literal eval scripts in
files or statically defined procedures.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">In contrast, a
procedure definition or <b>eval</b> within a dynamically
<b>eval</b>uated environment count linenumbers relative to
the start of their script, even if they would be able to
count relative to the start of the outer dynamic script.
That type of number usually makes more sense.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">A different way
of describing this behaviour is that file based locations
are tracked as deeply as possible, and where this is not
possible the lines are counted based on the smallest
possible <b>eval</b> or procedure body, as that scope is
usually easier to find than any dynamic outer scope.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The syntactic
form <b>{*}</b> is handled like <b>eval</b>. I.e. if it is
given a literal list argument the system tracks the
linenumber within the list words as well, and otherwise all
linenumbers are counted relative to the start of each word
(smallest scope)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>info functions</b>
?<i>pattern</i>?</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If <i>pattern</i> is not
specified, returns a list of all the math functions
currently defined. If <i>pattern</i> is specified, only
those functions whose name matches <i>pattern</i> are
returned. Matching is determined using the same rules as for
<b>string match</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>info globals</b>
?<i>pattern</i>?</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If <i>pattern</i> is not
specified, returns a list of all the names of
currently-defined global variables. Global variables are
variables in the global namespace. If <i>pattern</i> is
specified, only those names matching <i>pattern</i> are
returned. Matching is determined using the same rules as for
<b>string match</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>info hostname</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Returns the name of the
computer on which this invocation is being executed. Note
that this name is not guaranteed to be the fully qualified
domain name of the host. Where machines have several
different names (as is common on systems with both TCP/IP
(DNS) and NetBIOS-based networking installed,) it is the
name that is suitable for TCP/IP networking that is
returned.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>info level</b>
?<i>number</i>?</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If <i>number</i> is not
specified, this command returns a number giving the stack
level of the invoking procedure, or 0 if the command is
invoked at top-level. If <i>number</i> is specified, then
the result is a list consisting of the name and arguments
for the procedure call at level <i>number</i> on the stack.
If <i>number</i> is positive then it selects a particular
stack level (1 refers to the top-most active procedure, 2 to
the procedure it called, and so on); otherwise it gives a
level relative to the current level (0 refers to the current
procedure, -1 to its caller, and so on). See the
<b>uplevel</b> command for more information on what stack
levels mean.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>info library</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Returns the name of the library
directory in which standard Tcl scripts are stored. This is
actually the value of the <b>tcl_library</b> variable and
may be changed by setting <b>tcl_library</b>. See the
<b>tclvars</b> manual entry for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>info loaded</b>
?<i>interp</i>?</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Returns a list describing all
of the packages that have been loaded into <i>interp</i>
with the <b>load</b> command. Each list element is a
sub-list with two elements consisting of the name of the
file from which the package was loaded and the name of the
package. For statically-loaded packages the file name will
be an empty string. If <i>interp</i> is omitted then
information is returned for all packages loaded in any
interpreter in the process. To get a list of just the
packages in the current interpreter, specify an empty string
for the <i>interp</i> argument.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>info locals</b>
?<i>pattern</i>?</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If <i>pattern</i> is not
specified, returns a list of all the names of
currently-defined local variables, including arguments to
the current procedure, if any. Variables defined with the
<b>global</b>, <b>upvar</b> and <b>variable</b> commands
will not be returned. If <i>pattern</i> is specified, only
those names matching <i>pattern</i> are returned. Matching
is determined using the same rules as for <b>string
match</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>info
nameofexecutable</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Returns the full path name of
the binary file from which the application was invoked. If
Tcl was unable to identify the file, then an empty string is
returned.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>info patchlevel</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Returns the value of the global
variable <b>tcl_patchLevel</b>; see the <b>tclvars</b>
manual entry for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>info procs</b>
?<i>pattern</i>?</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If <i>pattern</i> is not
specified, returns a list of all the names of Tcl command
procedures in the current namespace. If <i>pattern</i> is
specified, only those procedure names in the current
namespace matching <i>pattern</i> are returned. Matching is
determined using the same rules as for <b>string match</b>.
If <i>pattern</i> contains any namespace separators, they
are used to select a namespace relative to the current
namespace (or relative to the global namespace if
<i>pattern</i> starts with <b>::</b>) to match within; the
matching pattern is taken to be the part after the last
namespace separator.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>info script</b>
?<i>filename</i>?</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If a Tcl script file is
currently being evaluated (i.e. there is a call to
<b>Tcl_EvalFile</b> active or there is an active invocation
of the <b>source</b> command), then this command returns the
name of the innermost file being processed. If
<i>filename</i> is specified, then the return value of this
command will be modified for the duration of the active
invocation to return that name. This is useful in virtual
file system applications. Otherwise the command returns an
empty string.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>info
sharedlibextension</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Returns the extension used on
this platform for the names of files containing shared
libraries (for example, <b>.so</b> under Solaris). If shared
libraries are not supported on this platform then an empty
string is returned.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>info tclversion</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Returns the value of the global
variable <b>tcl_version</b>; see the <b>tclvars</b> manual
entry for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>info vars</b>
?<i>pattern</i>?</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If <i>pattern</i> is not
specified, returns a list of all the names of
currently-visible variables. This includes locals and
currently-visible globals. If <i>pattern</i> is specified,
only those names matching <i>pattern</i> are returned.
Matching is determined using the same rules as for <b>string
match</b>. <i>pattern</i> can be a qualified name like
<b>Foo::option*</b>. That is, it may specify a particular
namespace using a sequence of namespace names separated by
double colons (<b>::</b>), and may have pattern matching
special characters at the end to specify a set of variables
in that namespace. If <i>pattern</i> is a qualified name,
the resulting list of variable names has each matching
namespace variable qualified with the name of its namespace.
Note that a currently-visible variable may not yet
&ldquo;exist&rdquo; if it has not been set (e.g. a variable
declared but not set by <b>variable</b>).</p>
