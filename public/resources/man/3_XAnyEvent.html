XEvent &minus; generic X event structures</p>

<h2>STRUCTURES
<a name="STRUCTURES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">All the event
structures declared in &lt;<i>X11/Xlib.h</i>&gt; have the
following common members:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%;">typedef struct {
        int type;
        unsigned long serial;   /* # of last request processed by server */
        Bool send_event;        /* true if this came from a SendEvent request */
        Display *display;       /* Display the event was read from */
        Window window;
} XAnyEvent;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The type member
is set to the event type constant name that uniquely
identifies it. For example, when the X server reports a
<i>GraphicsExpose</i> event to a client application, it
sends an <i>XGraphicsExposeEvent</i> structure with the type
member set to <i>GraphicsExpose</i>. The display member is
set to a pointer to the display the event was read on. The
send_event member is set to <i>True</i> if the event came
from a <i>SendEvent</i> protocol request. The serial member
is set from the serial number reported in the protocol but
expanded from the 16-bit least-significant bits to a full
32-bit value. The window member is set to the window that is
most useful to toolkit dispatchers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>XEvent</i> structure is a union of the individual
structures declared for each event type:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%;">typedef union _XEvent {
        int type;       /* must not be changed */
        XAnyEvent xany;
        XKeyEvent xkey;
        XButtonEvent xbutton;
        XMotionEvent xmotion;
        XCrossingEvent xcrossing;
        XFocusChangeEvent xfocus;
        XExposeEvent xexpose;
        XGraphicsExposeEvent xgraphicsexpose;
        XNoExposeEvent xnoexpose;
        XVisibilityEvent xvisibility;
        XCreateWindowEvent xcreatewindow;
        XDestroyWindowEvent xdestroywindow;
        XUnmapEvent xunmap;
        XMapEvent xmap;
        XMapRequestEvent xmaprequest;
        XReparentEvent xreparent;
        XConfigureEvent xconfigure;
        XGravityEvent xgravity;
        XResizeRequestEvent xresizerequest;
        XConfigureRequestEvent xconfigurerequest;
        XCirculateEvent xcirculate;
        XCirculateRequestEvent xcirculaterequest;
        XPropertyEvent xproperty;
        XSelectionClearEvent xselectionclear;
        XSelectionRequestEvent xselectionrequest;
        XSelectionEvent xselection;
        XColormapEvent xcolormap;
        XClientMessageEvent xclient;
        XMappingEvent xmapping;
        XErrorEvent xerror;
        XKeymapEvent xkeymap;
        long pad[24];
} XEvent;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">An
<i>XEvent</i> structure&rsquo;s first entry always is the
type member, which is set to the event type. The second
member always is the serial number of the protocol request
that generated the event. The third member always is
send_event, which is a <i>Bool</i> that indicates if the
event was sent by a different client. The fourth member
always is a display, which is the display that the event was
read from. Except for keymap events, the fifth member always
is a window, which has been carefully selected to be useful
to toolkit dispatchers. To avoid breaking toolkits, the
order of these first five entries is not to change. Most
events also contain a time member, which is the time at
which an event occurred. In addition, a pointer to the
generic event must be cast before it is used to access any
other information in the structure.</p>
