<h2>NAME

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">PCRE -
Perl-compatible regular expressions</p>

<h2>PCRE PERFORMANCE
<a name="PCRE PERFORMANCE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Two aspects of
performance are discussed below: memory usage and processing
time. The way you express your pattern as a regular
expression can affect both of them.</p>

<h2>COMPILED PATTERN MEMORY USAGE
<a name="COMPILED PATTERN MEMORY USAGE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Patterns are
compiled by PCRE into a reasonably efficient interpretive
code, so that most simple patterns do not use much memory.
However, there is one case where the memory usage of a
compiled pattern can be unexpectedly large. If a
parenthesized subpattern has a quantifier with a minimum
greater than 1 and/or a limited maximum, the whole
subpattern is repeated in the compiled code. For example,
the pattern</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">(abc|def){2,4}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">is compiled as
if it were</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">(abc|def)(abc|def)((abc|def)(abc|def)?)?</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">(Technical
aside: It is done this way so that backtrack points within
each of the repetitions can be independently
maintained.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For regular
expressions whose quantifiers use only small numbers, this
is not usually a problem. However, if the numbers are large,
and particularly if such repetitions are nested, the memory
usage can become an embarrassment. For example, the very
simple pattern</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">((ab){1,1000}c){1,3}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">uses 51K bytes
when compiled using the 8-bit library. When PCRE is compiled
with its default internal pointer size of two bytes, the
size limit on a compiled pattern is 64K data units, and this
is reached with the above pattern if the outer repetition is
increased from 3 to 4. PCRE can be compiled to use larger
internal pointers and thus handle larger compiled patterns,
but it is better to try to rewrite your pattern to use less
memory if you can.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">One way of
reducing the memory usage for such patterns is to make use
of PCRE&rsquo;s &quot;subroutine&quot; facility. Re-writing
the above pattern as</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">((ab)(?2){0,999}c)(?1){0,2}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">reduces the
memory requirements to 18K, and indeed it remains under 20K
even with the outer repetition increased to 100. However,
this pattern is not exactly equivalent, because the
&quot;subroutine&quot; calls are treated as atomic groups
into which there can be no backtracking if there is a
subsequent matching failure. Therefore, PCRE cannot do this
kind of rewriting automatically. Furthermore, there is a
noticeable loss of speed when executing the modified
pattern. Nevertheless, if the atomic grouping is not a
problem and the loss of speed is acceptable, this kind of
rewriting will allow you to process patterns that PCRE
cannot otherwise handle.</p>

<h2>STACK USAGE AT RUN TIME
<a name="STACK USAGE AT RUN TIME"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When
<b>pcre_exec()</b> or <b>pcre[16|32]_exec()</b> is used for
matching, certain kinds of pattern can cause it to use large
amounts of the process stack. In some environments the
default process stack is quite small, and if it runs out the
result is often SIGSEGV. This issue is probably the most
frequently raised problem with PCRE. Rewriting your pattern
can often help. The <b>pcrestack</b> documentation discusses
this issue in detail.</p>

<h2>PROCESSING TIME
<a name="PROCESSING TIME"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Certain items
in regular expression patterns are processed more
efficiently than others. It is more efficient to use a
character class like [aeiou] than a set of single-character
alternatives such as (a|e|i|o|u). In general, the simplest
construction that provides the required behaviour is usually
the most efficient. Jeffrey Friedl&rsquo;s book contains a
lot of useful general discussion about optimizing regular
expressions for efficient performance. This document
contains a few observations about PCRE.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Using Unicode
character properties (the \p, \P, and \X escapes) is slow,
because PCRE has to use a multi-stage table lookup whenever
it needs a character&rsquo;s property. If you can find an
alternative pattern that does not use character properties,
it will probably be faster.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">By default, the
escape sequences \b, \d, \s, and \w, and the POSIX character
classes such as [:alpha:] do not use Unicode properties,
partly for backwards compatibility, and partly for
performance reasons. However, you can set PCRE_UCP if you
want Unicode character properties to be used. This can
double the matching time for items such as \d, when matched
with a traditional matching function; the performance loss
is less with a DFA matching function, and in both cases
there is not much difference for \b.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When a pattern
begins with .* not in parentheses, or in parentheses that
are not the subject of a backreference, and the PCRE_DOTALL
option is set, the pattern is implicitly anchored by PCRE,
since it can match only at the start of a subject string.
However, if PCRE_DOTALL is not set, PCRE cannot make this
optimization, because the . metacharacter does not then
match a newline, and if the subject string contains
newlines, the pattern may match from the character
immediately following one of them instead of from the very
start. For example, the pattern</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">.*second</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">matches the
subject &quot;first\nand second&quot; (where \n stands for a
newline character), with the match starting at the seventh
character. In order to do this, PCRE has to retry the match
starting after every newline in the subject.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you are
using such a pattern with subject strings that do not
contain newlines, the best performance is obtained by
setting PCRE_DOTALL, or starting the pattern with ^.* or
^.*? to indicate explicit anchoring. That saves PCRE from
having to scan along the subject looking for a newline to
restart at.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Beware of
patterns that contain nested indefinite repeats. These can
take a long time to run when applied to a string that does
not match. Consider the pattern fragment</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">^(a+)*</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This can match
&quot;aaaa&quot; in 16 different ways, and this number
increases very rapidly as the string gets longer. (The *
repeat can match 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 times, and for each of
those cases other than 0 or 4, the + repeats can match
different numbers of times.) When the remainder of the
pattern is such that the entire match is going to fail, PCRE
has in principle to try every possible variation, and this
can take an extremely long time, even for relatively short
strings.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">An optimization
catches some of the more simple cases such as</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">(a+)*b</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">where a literal
character follows. Before embarking on the standard matching
procedure, PCRE checks that there is a &quot;b&quot; later
in the subject string, and if there is not, it fails the
match immediately. However, when there is no following
literal this optimization cannot be used. You can see the
difference by comparing the behaviour of</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">(a+)*\d</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">with the
pattern above. The former gives a failure almost instantly
when applied to a whole line of &quot;a&quot; characters,
whereas the latter takes an appreciable time with strings
longer than about 20 characters.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In many cases,
the solution to this kind of performance issue is to use an
atomic group or a possessive quantifier.</p>
