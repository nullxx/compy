<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This command
causes Tcl commands to be executed whenever certain
operations are invoked. The legal <i>option</i>s (which may
be abbreviated) are: <b><br>
trace add</b> <i>type name ops ?args?</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Where <i>type</i> is
<b>command</b>, <b>execution</b>, or <b>variable</b>.
<b><br>
trace add command</b> <i>name ops commandPrefix</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Arrange for
<i>commandPrefix</i> to be executed (with additional
arguments) whenever command <i>name</i> is modified in one
of the ways given by the list <i>ops</i>. <i>Name</i> will
be resolved using the usual namespace resolution rules used
by commands. If the command does not exist, an error will be
thrown.</p>

<p style="margin-left:32%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Ops</i>
indicates which operations are of interest, and is a list of
one or more of the following items:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="32%"></td>
<td width="10%">


<p><b>rename</b></p></td>
<td width="1%"></td>
<td width="57%">


<p>Invoke <i>commandPrefix</i> whenever the traced command
is renamed. Note that renaming to the empty string is
considered deletion, and will not be traced with
&ldquo;<b>rename</b>&rdquo;.</p> </td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="32%"></td>
<td width="10%">


<p><b>delete</b></p></td>
<td width="1%"></td>
<td width="57%">


<p>Invoke <i>commandPrefix</i> when the traced command is
deleted. Commands can be deleted explicitly by using the
<b>rename</b> command to rename the command to an empty
string. Commands are also deleted when the interpreter is
deleted, but traces will not be invoked because there is no
interpreter in which to execute them.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:32%; margin-top: 1em">When the trace
triggers, depending on the operations being traced, a number
of arguments are appended to <i>commandPrefix</i> so that
the actual command is as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-left:43%;"><i>commandPrefix oldName
newName op</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;"><i>OldName</i> and
<i>newName</i> give the traced command&rsquo;s current (old)
name, and the name to which it is being renamed (the empty
string if this is a &ldquo;delete&rdquo; operation).
<i>Op</i> indicates what operation is being performed on the
command, and is one of <b>rename</b> or <b>delete</b> as
defined above. The trace operation cannot be used to stop a
command from being deleted. Tcl will always remove the
command once the trace is complete. Recursive renaming or
deleting will not cause further traces of the same type to
be evaluated, so a delete trace which itself deletes the
command, or a rename trace which itself renames the command
will not cause further trace evaluations to occur. Both
<i>oldName</i> and <i>newName</i> are fully qualified with
any namespace(s) in which they appear.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>trace add execution</b>
<i>name ops commandPrefix</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Arrange for
<i>commandPrefix</i> to be executed (with additional
arguments) whenever command <i>name</i> is executed, with
traces occurring at the points indicated by the list
<i>ops</i>. <i>Name</i> will be resolved using the usual
namespace resolution rules used by commands. If the command
does not exist, an error will be thrown.</p>

<p style="margin-left:32%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Ops</i>
indicates which operations are of interest, and is a list of
one or more of the following items:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

<td width="3%"></td>

<p>Invoke <i>commandPrefix</i> whenever the command
<i>name</i> is executed, just after the actual execution
takes place.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:32%;"><b>enterstep</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:43%;">Invoke <i>commandPrefix</i> for
every Tcl command which is executed from the start of the
execution of the procedure <i>name</i> until that procedure
finishes. <i>CommandPrefix</i> is invoked just before the
actual execution of the Tcl command being reported takes
place. For example if we have &ldquo;proc foo {} { puts
&quot;hello&quot; }&rdquo;, then an <i>enterstep</i> trace
would be invoked just before &ldquo;<i>puts
&quot;hello&quot;</i>&rdquo; is executed. Setting an
<i>enterstep</i> trace on a command <i>name</i> that does
not refer to a procedure will not result in an error and is
simply ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;"><b>leavestep</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:43%;">Invoke <i>commandPrefix</i> for
every Tcl command which is executed from the start of the
execution of the procedure <i>name</i> until that procedure
finishes. <i>CommandPrefix</i> is invoked just after the
actual execution of the Tcl command being reported takes
place. Setting a <i>leavestep</i> trace on a command
<i>name</i> that does not refer to a procedure will not
result in an error and is simply ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-left:32%; margin-top: 1em">When the trace
triggers, depending on the operations being traced, a number
of arguments are appended to <i>commandPrefix</i> so that
the actual command is as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-left:32%; margin-top: 1em">For
<b>enter</b> and <b>enterstep</b> operations:</p>

<p style="margin-left:43%;"><i>commandPrefix command-string
op</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;"><i>Command-string</i> gives the
complete current command being executed (the traced command
for a <b>enter</b> operation, an arbitrary command for a
<b>enterstep</b> operation), including all arguments in
their fully expanded form. <i>Op</i> indicates what
operation is being performed on the command execution, and
is one of <b>enter</b> or <b>enterstep</b> as defined above.
The trace operation can be used to stop the command from
executing, by deleting the command in question. Of course
when the command is subsequently executed, an &ldquo;invalid
command&rdquo; error will occur.</p>

<p style="margin-left:32%; margin-top: 1em">For
<b>leave</b> and <b>leavestep</b> operations:</p>

<p style="margin-left:43%;"><i>commandPrefix command-string
code result op</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;"><i>Command-string</i> gives the
complete current command being executed (the traced command
for a <b>enter</b> operation, an arbitrary command for a
<b>enterstep</b> operation), including all arguments in
their fully expanded form. <i>Code</i> gives the result code
of that execution, and <i>result</i> the result string.
<i>Op</i> indicates what operation is being performed on the
command execution, and is one of <b>leave</b> or
<b>leavestep</b> as defined above. Note that the creation of
many <b>enterstep</b> or <b>leavestep</b> traces can lead to
unintuitive results, since the invoked commands from one
trace can themselves lead to further command invocations for
other traces.</p>


<p style="margin-left:32%; margin-top: 1em"><i>CommandPrefix</i>
executes in the same context as the code that invoked the
traced operation: thus the <i>commandPrefix</i>, if invoked
from a procedure, will have access to the same local
variables as code in the procedure. This context may be
different than the context in which the trace was created.
If <i>commandPrefix</i> invokes a procedure (which it
normally does) then the procedure will have to use
<b>upvar</b> or <b>uplevel</b> commands if it wishes to
access the local variables of the code which invoked the
trace operation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:32%; margin-top: 1em">While
<i>commandPrefix</i> is executing during an execution trace,
traces on <i>name</i> are temporarily disabled. This allows
the <i>commandPrefix</i> to execute <i>name</i> in its body
without invoking any other traces again. If an error occurs
while executing the <i>commandPrefix</i>, then the command
<i>name</i> as a whole will return that same error.</p>

<p style="margin-left:32%; margin-top: 1em">When multiple
traces are set on <i>name</i>, then for <i>enter</i> and
<i>enterstep</i> operations, the traced commands are invoked
in the reverse order of how the traces were originally
created; and for <i>leave</i> and <i>leavestep</i>
operations, the traced commands are invoked in the original
order of creation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:32%; margin-top: 1em">The behavior of
execution traces is currently undefined for a command
<i>name</i> imported into another namespace.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>trace add variable</b>
<i>name ops commandPrefix</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Arrange for
<i>commandPrefix</i> to be executed whenever variable
<i>name</i> is accessed in one of the ways given by the list
<i>ops</i>. <i>Name</i> may refer to a normal variable, an
element of an array, or to an array as a whole (i.e.
<i>name</i> may be just the name of an array, with no
parenthesized index). If <i>name</i> refers to a whole
array, then <i>commandPrefix</i> is invoked whenever any
element of the array is manipulated. If the variable does
not exist, it will be created but will not be given a value,
so it will be visible to <b>namespace which</b> queries, but
not to <b>info exists</b> queries.</p>

<p style="margin-left:32%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Ops</i>
indicates which operations are of interest, and is a list of
one or more of the following items:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="32%"></td>
<td width="8%">


<p><b>array</b></p></td>
<td width="3%"></td>
<td width="57%">


<p>Invoke <i>commandPrefix</i> whenever the variable is
accessed or modified via the <b>array</b> command, provided
that <i>name</i> is not a scalar variable at the time that
the <b>array</b> command is invoked. If <i>name</i> is a
scalar variable, the access via the <b>array</b> command
will not trigger the trace.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="32%"></td>
<td width="8%">


<p><b>read</b></p></td>
<td width="3%"></td>
<td width="57%">


<p>Invoke <i>commandPrefix</i> whenever the variable is

<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="32%"></td>
<td width="8%">


<p><b>write</b></p></td>
<td width="3%"></td>
<td width="57%">


<p>Invoke <i>commandPrefix</i> whenever the variable is

<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="32%"></td>
<td width="8%">


<p><b>unset</b></p></td>
<td width="3%"></td>
<td width="57%">


<p>Invoke <i>commandPrefix</i> whenever the variable is
unset. Variables can be unset explicitly with the
<b>unset</b> command, or implicitly when procedures return
(all of their local variables are unset). Variables are also
unset when interpreters are deleted, but traces will not be
invoked because there is no interpreter in which to execute
them.</p> </td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:32%; margin-top: 1em">When the trace
triggers, three arguments are appended to
<i>commandPrefix</i> so that the actual command is as
follows:</p>

<p style="margin-left:43%;"><i>commandPrefix name1 name2
op</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;"><i>Name1</i> and <i>name2</i>
give the name(s) for the variable being accessed: if the
variable is a scalar then <i>name1</i> gives the
variable&rsquo;s name and <i>name2</i> is an empty string;
if the variable is an array element then <i>name1</i> gives
the name of the array and name2 gives the index into the
array; if an entire array is being deleted and the trace was
registered on the overall array, rather than a single
element, then <i>name1</i> gives the array name and
<i>name2</i> is an empty string. <i>Name1</i> and
<i>name2</i> are not necessarily the same as the name used
in the <b>trace variable</b> command: the <b>upvar</b>
command allows a procedure to reference a variable under a
different name. <i>Op</i> indicates what operation is being
performed on the variable, and is one of <b>read</b>,
<b>write</b>, or <b>unset</b> as defined above.</p>


<p style="margin-left:32%; margin-top: 1em"><i>CommandPrefix</i>
executes in the same context as the code that invoked the
traced operation: if the variable was accessed as part of a
Tcl procedure, then <i>commandPrefix</i> will have access to
the same local variables as code in the procedure. This
context may be different than the context in which the trace
was created. If <i>commandPrefix</i> invokes a procedure
(which it normally does) then the procedure will have to use
<b>upvar</b> or <b>uplevel</b> if it wishes to access the
traced variable. Note also that <i>name1</i> may not
necessarily be the same as the name used to set the trace on
the variable; differences can occur if the access is made
through a variable defined with the <b>upvar</b>
command.</p>

<p style="margin-left:32%; margin-top: 1em">For read and
write traces, <i>commandPrefix</i> can modify the variable
to affect the result of the traced operation. If
<i>commandPrefix</i> modifies the value of a variable during
a read or write trace, then the new value will be returned
as the result of the traced operation. The return value from
<i>commandPrefix</i> is ignored except that if it returns an
error of any sort then the traced operation also returns an
error with the same error message returned by the trace
command (this mechanism can be used to implement read-only
variables, for example). For write traces,
<i>commandPrefix</i> is invoked after the variable&rsquo;s
value has been changed; it can write a new value into the
variable to override the original value specified in the
write operation. To implement read-only variables,
<i>commandPrefix</i> will have to restore the old value of
the variable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:32%; margin-top: 1em">While
<i>commandPrefix</i> is executing during a read or write
trace, traces on the variable are temporarily disabled. This
means that reads and writes invoked by <i>commandPrefix</i>
will occur directly, without invoking <i>commandPrefix</i>
(or any other traces) again. However, if
<i>commandPrefix</i> unsets the variable then unset traces
will be invoked.</p>

<p style="margin-left:32%; margin-top: 1em">When an unset
trace is invoked, the variable has already been deleted: it
will appear to be undefined with no traces. If an unset
occurs because of a procedure return, then the trace will be
invoked in the variable context of the procedure being
returned to: the stack frame of the returning procedure will
no longer exist. Traces are not disabled during unset
traces, so if an unset trace command creates a new trace and
accesses the variable, the trace will be invoked. Any errors
in unset traces are ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-left:32%; margin-top: 1em">If there are
multiple traces on a variable they are invoked in order of
creation, most-recent first. If one trace returns an error,
then no further traces are invoked for the variable. If an
array element has a trace set, and there is also a trace set
on the array as a whole, the trace on the overall array is
invoked before the one on the element.</p>

<p style="margin-left:32%; margin-top: 1em">Once created,
the trace remains in effect either until the trace is
removed with the <b>trace remove variable</b> command
described below, until the variable is unset, or until the
interpreter is deleted. Unsetting an element of array will
remove any traces on that element, but will not remove
traces on the overall array.</p>

<p style="margin-left:32%; margin-top: 1em">This command
returns an empty string.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>trace remove</b> <i>type
name opList commandPrefix</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Where <i>type</i> is either
<b>command</b>, <b>execution</b> or <b>variable</b>. <b><br>
trace remove command</b> <i>name opList

<p style="margin-left:32%;">If there is a trace set on
command <i>name</i> with the operations and command given by
<i>opList</i> and <i>commandPrefix</i>, then the trace is
removed, so that <i>commandPrefix</i> will never again be
invoked. Returns an empty string. If <i>name</i> does not
exist, the command will throw an error.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>trace remove execution</b>
<i>name opList commandPrefix</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">If there is a trace set on
command <i>name</i> with the operations and command given by

removed, so that <i>commandPrefix</i> will never again be
invoked. Returns an empty string. If <i>name</i> does not
exist, the command will throw an error.</p>

<i>name opList commandPrefix</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">If there is a trace set on
variable <i>name</i> with the operations and command given
by <i>opList</i> and <i>commandPrefix</i>, then the trace is
removed, so that <i>commandPrefix</i> will never again be
invoked. Returns an empty string.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>trace info</b> <i>type

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Where <i>type</i> is either
<b>command</b>, <b>execution</b> or <b>variable</b>. <b><br>
trace info command</b> <i>name</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Returns a list containing one
element for each trace currently set on command <i>name</i>.
Each element of the list is itself a list containing two
elements, which are the <i>opList</i> and
<i>commandPrefix</i> associated with the trace. If
<i>name</i> does not have any traces set, then the result of
the command will be an empty string. If <i>name</i> does not
exist, the command will throw an error.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>trace info execution</b>
<i>name</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Returns a list containing one
element for each trace currently set on command <i>name</i>.
Each element of the list is itself a list containing two
elements, which are the <i>opList</i> and
<i>commandPrefix</i> associated with the trace. If
<i>name</i> does not have any traces set, then the result of
the command will be an empty string. If <i>name</i> does not
exist, the command will throw an error.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>trace info variable</b>
<i>name</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Returns a list containing one
element for each trace currently set on variable
<i>name</i>. Each element of the list is itself a list
containing two elements, which are the <i>opList</i> and
<i>commandPrefix</i> associated with the trace. If
<i>name</i> does not exist or does not have any traces set,
then the result of the command will be an empty string.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For backwards
compatibility, three other subcommands are available:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>trace variable</b> <i>name
ops command</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">This is equivalent to <b>trace
add variable</b> <i>name ops command</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>trace vdelete</b> <i>name
ops command</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">This is equivalent to <b>trace
remove variable</b> <i>name ops command</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>trace vinfo</b>
<i>name</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">This is equivalent to <b>trace
info variable</b> <i>name</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These
subcommands are deprecated and will likely be removed in a
future version of Tcl. They use an older syntax in which
<b>array</b>, <b>read</b>, <b>write</b>, <b>unset</b> are
replaced by <b>a</b>, <b>r</b>, <b>w</b> and <b>u</b>
respectively, and the <i>ops</i> argument is not a list, but
simply a string concatenation of the operations, such as
<b>rwua</b>.</p>
