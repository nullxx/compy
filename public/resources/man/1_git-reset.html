</h2>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In the first
and second form, copy entries from &lt;tree&minus;ish&gt; to
the index. In the third form, set the current branch head
(HEAD) to &lt;commit&gt;, optionally modifying index and
working tree to match. The
&lt;tree&minus;ish&gt;/&lt;commit&gt; defaults to HEAD in
all forms.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>git
reset</i> [&minus;q] [&lt;tree&minus;ish&gt;]
[&minus;&minus;] &lt;paths&gt;...</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This form resets the index
entries for all &lt;paths&gt; to their state at
&lt;tree&minus;ish&gt;. (It does not affect the working
tree, nor the current branch.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This means that
git reset &lt;paths&gt; is the opposite of git add
&lt;paths&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">After running
git reset &lt;paths&gt; to update the index entry, you can
use <b>git-checkout</b>(1) to check the contents out of the
index to the working tree. Alternatively, using
<b>git-checkout</b>(1) and specifying a commit, you can copy
the contents of a path out of a commit to the index and to
the working tree in one go.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>git
reset</i> (&minus;&minus;patch | &minus;p)
[&lt;tree&minus;ish&gt;] [&minus;&minus;]
[&lt;paths&gt;...]</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Interactively select hunks in
the difference between the index and &lt;tree&minus;ish&gt;
(defaults to HEAD). The chosen hunks are applied in reverse
to the index.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This means that
git reset &minus;p is the opposite of git add &minus;p, i.e.
you can use it to selectively reset hunks. See the
&ldquo;Interactive Mode&rdquo; section of <b>git-add</b>(1)
to learn how to operate the &minus;&minus;patch mode.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>git
reset</i> [&lt;mode&gt;] [&lt;commit&gt;]</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This form resets the current
branch head to &lt;commit&gt; and possibly updates the index
(resetting it to the tree of &lt;commit&gt;) and the working
tree depending on &lt;mode&gt;. If &lt;mode&gt; is omitted,
defaults to &quot;&minus;&minus;mixed&quot;. The
&lt;mode&gt; must be one of the following:</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;soft</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">Does not touch the index file
nor the working tree at all (but resets the head to
&lt;commit&gt;, just like all modes do). This leaves all
your changed files &quot;Changes to be committed&quot;, as
<i>git status</i> would put it.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;mixed</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">Resets the index but not the
working tree (i.e., the changed files are preserved but not
marked for commit) and reports what has not been updated.
This is the default action.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;hard</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">Resets the index and working
tree. Any changes to tracked files in the working tree since
&lt;commit&gt; are discarded.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;merge</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">Resets the index and updates
the files in the working tree that are different between
&lt;commit&gt; and HEAD, but keeps those which are different
between the index and working tree (i.e. which have changes
which have not been added). If a file that is different
between &lt;commit&gt; and the index has unstaged changes,
reset is aborted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">In other words,
&minus;&minus;merge does something like a <i>git
read&minus;tree &minus;u &minus;m &lt;commit&gt;</i>, but
carries forward unmerged index entries.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;keep</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">Resets index entries and
updates files in the working tree that are different between
&lt;commit&gt; and HEAD. If a file that is different between
&lt;commit&gt; and HEAD has local changes, reset is
aborted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you want to
undo a commit other than the latest on a branch,
<b>git-revert</b>(1) is your friend.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><b>1.</b> You
are happily working on something, and find the changes in
these files are in good order. You do not want to see them
when you run &quot;git diff&quot;, because you plan to work
on other files and changes with these files are distracting.
<b><br>
2.</b> Somebody asks you to pull, and the changes sounds
worthy of merging. <b><br>
3.</b> However, you already dirtied the index (i.e. your
index does not match the HEAD commit). But you know the pull
you are going to make does not affect frotz.c nor filfre.c,
so you revert the index changes for these two files. Your
changes in working tree remain there. <b><br>
4.</b> Then you can pull and merge, leaving frotz.c and
filfre.c changes still in the working tree.</p>

have made some commits, but realize they were premature to
be in the &quot;master&quot; branch. You want to continue
polishing them in a topic branch, so create
&quot;topic/wip&quot; branch off of the current HEAD.
<b><br>

you were not ready to spend a lot of time merging right now,
so you decide to do that later. <b><br>
2.</b> &quot;pull&quot; has not made merge commit, so
&quot;git reset &minus;&minus;hard&quot; which is a synonym
for &quot;git reset &minus;&minus;hard HEAD&quot; clears the
mess from the index file and the working tree. <b><br>
3.</b> Merge a topic branch into the current branch, which
resulted in a fast&minus;forward. <b><br>
4.</b> But you decided that the topic branch is not ready
for public consumption yet. &quot;pull&quot; or
&quot;merge&quot; always leaves the original tip of the
current branch in ORIG_HEAD, so resetting hard to it brings
your index file and the working tree back to that state, and
resets the tip of the branch to that commit.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><b>1.</b> Even
if you may have local modifications in your working tree,
you can safely say &quot;git pull&quot; when you know that
the change in the other branch does not overlap with them.
<b><br>
2.</b> After inspecting the result of the merge, you may
find that the change in the other branch is unsatisfactory.
Running &quot;git reset &minus;&minus;hard ORIG_HEAD&quot;
will let you go back to where you were, but it will discard
your local changes, which you do not want. &quot;git reset
&minus;&minus;merge&quot; keeps your local changes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Interrupted
workflow</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Suppose you are interrupted by
an urgent fix request while you are in the middle of a large
change. The files in your working tree are not in any shape
to be committed yet, but you need to get to the other branch
for a quick bugfix.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><b>1.</b> This
commit will get blown away so a throw&minus;away log message
is OK. <b><br>
2.</b> This removes the <i>WIP</i> commit from the commit
history, and sets your working tree to the state just before
you made that snapshot. <b><br>
3.</b> At this point the index file still has all the WIP
changes you committed as <i>snapshot WIP</i>. This updates
the index to show your WIP files as uncommitted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Reset a single
file in the index</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Suppose you have added a file
to your index, but later decide you do not want to add it to
your commit. You can remove the file from the index while
keeping your changes with git reset.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">$ git reset

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><b>1.</b> This
removes the file from the index while keeping it in the
working directory. <b><br>
2.</b> This commits all other changes in the index. <b><br>
3.</b> Adds the file to the index again.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Keep changes in
working tree while discarding some previous commits</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Suppose you are working on
something and you commit it, and then you continue working a
bit more, but now you think that what you have in your
working tree should be in another branch that has nothing to
do with what you committed previously. You can start a new
branch and reset it while keeping the changes in your
working tree.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">$ git tag start
<br>
$ git checkout &minus;b branch1 <br>
$ edit <br>
$ git commit ... <b>(1)</b> <br>
$ edit <br>
$ git checkout &minus;b branch2 <b>(2)</b> <br>
$ git reset &minus;&minus;keep start <b>(3)</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><b>1.</b> This
commits your first edits in branch1. <b><br>
2.</b> In the ideal world, you could have realized that the
earlier commit did not belong to the new topic when you
created and switched to branch2 (i.e. &quot;git checkout
&minus;b branch2 start&quot;), but nobody is perfect.
<b><br>
3.</b> But you can use &quot;reset &minus;&minus;keep&quot;
to remove the unwanted commit after you switched to
&quot;branch2&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The tables

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">to reset the

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In these
tables, A, B, C and D are some different states of a file.
For example, the first line of the first table means that if
a file is in state A in the working tree, in state B in the
index, in state C in HEAD and in state D in the target, then
&quot;git reset &minus;&minus;soft target&quot; will leave
the file in the working tree in state A and in the index in
state B. It resets (i.e. moves) the HEAD (i.e. the tip of
the current branch, if you are on one) to &quot;target&quot;
(which has the file in state D).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;reset
&minus;&minus;merge&quot; is meant to be used when resetting
out of a conflicted merge. Any mergy operation guarantees
that the working tree file that is involved in the merge
does not have local change wrt the index before it starts,
and that it writes the result out to the working tree. So if
we see some difference between the index and the target and
also between the index and the working tree, then it means
that we are not resetting out from a state that a mergy
operation left after failing with a conflict. That is why we
disallow &minus;&minus;merge option in this case.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;reset
&minus;&minus;keep&quot; is meant to be used when removing
some of the last commits in the current branch while keeping
changes in the working tree. If there could be conflicts
between the changes in the commit we want to remove and the
changes in the working tree we want to keep, the reset is
disallowed. That&rsquo;s why it is disallowed if there are
both changes between the working tree and HEAD, and between
HEAD and the target. To be safe, it is also disallowed when
there are unmerged entries.</p>
