<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>hwclock</b>
[<i>function</i>] [<i>option</i>...]</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>hwclock</b>
is a tool for accessing the Hardware Clock. You can display
the current time, set the Hardware Clock to a specified
time, set the Hardware Clock from the System Time, or set
the System Time from the Hardware Clock.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can also
run <b>hwclock</b> periodically to add or subtract time from
the Hardware Clock to compensate for systematic drift (where
the clock consistently loses or gains time at a certain rate
when left to run).</p>

<h2>FUNCTIONS
<a name="FUNCTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You need
exactly one of the following options to tell <b>hwclock</b>
what function to perform: <b><br>
&minus;r</b>,&nbsp;<b>&minus;&minus;show</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Read the Hardware Clock and
print the time on standard output. The time shown is always
in local time, even if you keep your Hardware Clock in
Coordinated Universal Time. See the <b>&minus;&minus;utc</b>
option. Showing the Hardware Clock time is the default when
no function is specified.</p>

</table>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;s</b>,&nbsp;<b>&minus;&minus;hctosys</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set the System Time from the
Hardware Clock.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Also set the
kernel&rsquo;s timezone value to the local timezone as
indicated by the TZ environment variable and/or
<i>/usr/share/zoneinfo</i>, as <b>tzset</b>(3) would
interpret them. The obsolete tz_dsttime field of the
kernel&rsquo;s timezone value is set to DST_NONE. (For
details on what this field used to mean, see
<b>settimeofday</b>(2).)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">This is a good
option to use in one of the system startup scripts.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;w</b>,&nbsp;<b>&minus;&minus;systohc</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set the Hardware Clock to the
current System Time.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;systz</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set the kernel&rsquo;s timezone
and reset the System Time based on the current timezone.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The system time
is only reset on the first call after boot.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The local
timezone is taken to be what is indicated by the TZ
environment variable and/or <i>/usr/share/zoneinfo</i>, as
<b>tzset</b>(3) would interpret them. The obsolete
tz_dsttime field of the kernel&rsquo;s timezone value is set
to DST_NONE. (For details on what this field used to mean,
see <b>settimeofday</b>(2).)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">This is an
alternate option to <b>&minus;&minus;hctosys</b> that does
not read the hardware clock, and may be used in system
startup scripts for recent 2.6 kernels where you know the
System Time contains the Hardware Clock time. If the
Hardware Clock is already in UTC, it is not reset.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;adjust</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Add or subtract time from the
Hardware Clock to account for systematic drift since the
last time the clock was set or adjusted. See discussion
below.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;getepoch</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Print the kernel&rsquo;s
Hardware Clock epoch value to standard output. This is the
number of years into AD to which a zero year value in the
Hardware Clock refers. For example, if you are using the
convention that the year counter in your Hardware Clock
contains the number of full years since 1952, then the
kernel&rsquo;s Hardware Clock epoch value must be 1952.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">This epoch
value is used whenever <b>hwclock</b> reads or sets the
Hardware Clock.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;setepoch</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set the kernel&rsquo;s Hardware
Clock epoch value to the value specified by the
<b>&minus;&minus;epoch</b> option. See the
<b>&minus;&minus;getepoch</b> option for details.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;predict</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Predict what the RTC will read
at time given by the <b>&minus;&minus;date</b> option based
on the adjtime file. This is useful for example if you need
to set an RTC wakeup time to distant future and want to
account for the RTC drift.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;c</b>,&nbsp;<b>&minus;&minus;compare</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Periodically compare the
Hardware Clock to the System Time and output the difference
every 10 seconds. This will also print the frequency offset
and tick.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;h</b>,&nbsp;<b>&minus;&minus;help</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Display a help text and
exit.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;V</b>,&nbsp;<b>&minus;&minus;version</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Display the version of
<b>hwclock</b> and exit.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The first two
options apply to just a few specific functions, the others
apply to most functions. <b><br>
&minus;&minus;date=</b><i>date_string</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">You need this option if you
specify the <b>&minus;&minus;set</b> or
<b>&minus;&minus;predict</b> functions, otherwise it is
ignored. It specifies the time to which to set the Hardware
Clock, or the time for which to predict the Hardware Clock
reading. The value of this option is an argument to the
<b>date</b>(1) program. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>hwclock
--set --date=&quot;2011-08-14 16:45:05&quot;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The argument
must be in local time, even if you keep your Hardware Clock
in Coordinated Universal time. See the
<b>&minus;&minus;utc</b> option.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;epoch=</b><i>year</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specifies the year which is the
beginning of the Hardware Clock&rsquo;s epoch, that is the
number of years into AD to which a zero value in the
Hardware Clock&rsquo;s year counter refers. It is used
together with the <b>&minus;&minus;setepoch</b> option to
set the kernel&rsquo;s idea of the epoch of the Hardware
Clock, or otherwise to specify the epoch for use with direct
ISA access.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">For example, on
a Digital Unix machine:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>hwclock
--setepoch --epoch=1952</b></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;u</b>,&nbsp;<b>&minus;&minus;utc
<br>
&minus;&minus;localtime</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Indicates that the Hardware
Clock is kept in Coordinated Universal Time or local time,
respectively. It is your choice whether to keep your clock
in UTC or local time, but nothing in the clock tells which
you&rsquo;ve chosen. So this option is how you give that
information to <b>hwclock</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If you specify
the wrong one of these options (or specify neither and take
a wrong default), both setting and querying of the Hardware
Clock will be messed up.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If you specify
neither <b>&minus;&minus;utc</b> nor
<b>&minus;&minus;localtime</b>, the default is whichever was
specified the last time <b>hwclock</b> was used to set the
clock (i.e. <b>hwclock</b> was successfully run with the
<b>&minus;&minus;set</b>, <b>&minus;&minus;systohc</b>, or
<b>&minus;&minus;adjust</b> options), as recorded in the
adjtime file. If the adjtime file doesn&rsquo;t exist, the
default is UTC time.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;noadjfile</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Disables the facilities
provided by <i>/etc/adjtime</i>. <b>hwclock</b> will not
read nor write to that file with this option. Either
<b>&minus;&minus;utc</b> or <b>&minus;&minus;localtime</b>
must be specified when using this option.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;adjfile=</b><i>filename</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Overrides the default
/etc/adjtime.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;f</b>,&nbsp;<b>&minus;&minus;rtc=</b><i>filename</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Overrides the default /dev file
name, which is <i>/dev/rtc</i> on many platforms but may be
<i>/dev/rtc0</i>, <i>/dev/rtc1</i>, and so on.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;directisa</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This option is meaningful only
on an ISA machine or an Alpha (which implements enough of
ISA to be, roughly speaking, an ISA machine for
<b>hwclock</b>&rsquo;s purposes). For other machines, it has
no effect. This option tells <b>hwclock</b> to use explicit
I/O instructions to access the Hardware Clock. Without this
option, <b>hwclock</b> will try to use the /dev/rtc device
(which it assumes to be driven by the RTC device driver). If
it is unable to open the device (for reading), it will use
the explicit I/O instructions anyway.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;badyear</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Indicates that the Hardware
Clock is incapable of storing years outside the range
1994-1999. There is a problem in some BIOSes (almost all
Award BIOSes made between 4/26/94 and 5/31/95) wherein they
are unable to deal with years after 1999. If one attempts to
set the year-of-century value to something less than 94 (or
95 in some cases), the value that actually gets set is 94
(or 95). Thus, if you have one of these machines,
<b>hwclock</b> cannot set the year after 1999 and cannot use
the value of the clock as the true time in the normal
way.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">To compensate
for this (without your getting a BIOS update, which would
definitely be preferable), always use
<b>&minus;&minus;badyear</b> if you have one of these
machines. When <b>hwclock</b> knows it&rsquo;s working with
a brain-damaged clock, it ignores the year part of the
Hardware Clock value and instead tries to guess the year
based on the last calibrated date in the adjtime file, by
assuming that date is within the past year. For this to
work, you had better do a <b>hwclock &minus;&minus;set</b>
or <b>hwclock &minus;&minus;systohc</b> at least once a
year!</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Though
<b>hwclock</b> ignores the year value when it reads the
Hardware Clock, it sets the year value when it sets the
clock. It sets it to 1995, 1996, 1997, or 1998, whichever
one has the same position in the leap year cycle as the true
year. That way, the Hardware Clock inserts leap days where
they belong. Again, if you let the Hardware Clock run for
more than a year without setting it, this scheme could be
defeated and you could end up losing a day.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>hwclock</b>
warns you that you probably need
<b>&minus;&minus;badyear</b> whenever it finds your Hardware
Clock set to 1994 or 1995.</p>

don&rsquo;t have an Alpha and are usually unnecessary if you
do, because <b>hwclock</b> should be able to determine by
itself what it&rsquo;s running on, at least when
<i>/proc</i> is mounted. (If you find you need one of these
options to make <b>hwclock</b> work, contact the maintainer
to see if the program can be improved to detect your system
automatically. Output of &lsquo;hwclock --debug&rsquo; and
&lsquo;cat /proc/cpuinfo&rsquo; may be of interest.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Option
<b>&minus;&minus;jensen</b> means you are running on a
Jensen model. And <b>&minus;&minus;funky&minus;toy</b> means
that on your machine one has to use the UF bit instead of
the UIP bit in the Hardware Clock to detect a time

<h2>NOTES
<a name="NOTES"></a>
</h2>


<h2>Clocks in a Linux System
<a name="Clocks in a Linux System"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There are two
main clocks in a Linux system:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>The Hardware
Clock:</b> This is a clock that runs independently of any
control program running in the CPU and even when the machine
is powered off.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On an ISA
system, this clock is specified as part of the ISA standard.
The control program can read or set this clock to a whole
second, but the control program can also detect the edges of
the 1 second clock ticks, so the clock actually has
virtually infinite precision.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This clock is
commonly called the hardware clock, the real time clock, the
RTC, the BIOS clock, and the CMOS clock. Hardware Clock, in
its capitalized form, was coined for use by <b>hwclock</b>
because all of the other names are inappropriate to the
point of being misleading.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">So for example,
some non-ISA systems have a few real time clocks with only
one of them having its own power domain. A very low power
external I2C or SPI clock chip might be used with a backup
battery as the hardware clock to initialize a more
functional integrated real-time clock which is used for most
other purposes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>The System
Time:</b> This is the time kept by a clock inside the Linux
kernel and driven by a timer interrupt. (On an ISA machine,
the timer interrupt is part of the ISA standard). It has
meaning only while Linux is running on the machine. The
System Time is the number of seconds since 00:00:00 January
1, 1970 UTC (or more succinctly, the number of seconds since
1969). The System Time is not an integer, though. It has
virtually infinite precision.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The System Time
is the time that matters. The Hardware Clock&rsquo;s basic
purpose in a Linux system is to keep time when Linux is not
running. You initialize the System Time to the time from the
Hardware Clock when Linux starts up, and then never use the
Hardware Clock again. Note that in DOS, for which ISA was
designed, the Hardware Clock is the only real time
clock.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is important
that the System Time not have any discontinuities such as
would happen if you used the <b>date</b>(1L) program to set
it while the system is running. You can, however, do
whatever you want to the Hardware Clock while the system is
running, and the next time Linux starts up, it will do so
with the adjusted time from the Hardware Clock.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A Linux kernel
maintains a concept of a local timezone for the system. But
don&rsquo;t be misled -- almost nobody cares what timezone
the kernel thinks it is in. Instead, programs that care
about the timezone (perhaps because they want to display a
local time for you) almost always use a more traditional
method of determining the timezone: They use the TZ
environment variable and/or the <i>/usr/share/zoneinfo</i>
directory, as explained in the man page for <b>tzset</b>(3).
However, some programs and fringe parts of the Linux kernel
such as filesystems use the kernel timezone value. An
example is the vfat filesystem. If the kernel timezone value
is wrong, the vfat filesystem will report and set the wrong
timestamps on files.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>hwclock</b>
sets the kernel timezone to the value indicated by TZ and/or
<i>/usr/share/zoneinfo</i> when you set the System Time
using the <b>&minus;&minus;hctosys</b> option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The timezone
value actually consists of two parts: 1) a field
tz_minuteswest indicating how many minutes local time (not
adjusted for DST) lags behind UTC, and 2) a field tz_dsttime
indicating the type of Daylight Savings Time (DST)
convention that is in effect in the locality at the present
time. This second field is not used under Linux and is
always zero. (See also <b>settimeofday</b>(2).)</p>

<h2>Users access and setuid
<a name="Users access and setuid"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Sometimes, you
need to install <b>hwclock</b> setuid root. If you want
users other than the superuser to be able to display the
clock value using the direct ISA I/O method, install it
setuid root. If you have the /dev/rtc interface on your
system or are on a non-ISA system, there&rsquo;s probably no
need for users to use the direct ISA I/O method, so
don&rsquo;t bother.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In any case,
hwclock will not allow you to set anything unless you have
the superuser real uid. (This is restriction is not
necessary if you haven&rsquo;t installed setuid root, but
it&rsquo;s there for now).</p>

<h2>How hwclock Accesses the Hardware Clock
<a name="How hwclock Accesses the Hardware Clock"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>hwclock</b>
uses many different ways to get and set Hardware Clock
values. The most normal way is to do I/O to the device
special file /dev/rtc, which is presumed to be driven by the
rtc device driver. However, this method is not always
available. For one thing, the rtc driver is a relatively
recent addition to Linux. Older systems don&rsquo;t have it.
Also, though there are versions of the rtc driver that work
on DEC Alphas, there appear to be plenty of Alphas on which
the rtc driver does not work (a common symptom is hwclock
hanging). Moreover, recent Linux systems have more generic
support for RTCs, even systems that have more than one, so
you might need to override the default by specifying
<i>/dev/rtc0</i> or <i>/dev/rtc1</i> instead.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On older
systems, the method of accessing the Hardware Clock depends
on the system hardware.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On an ISA
system, <b>hwclock</b> can directly access the &quot;CMOS
memory&quot; registers that constitute the clock, by doing
I/O to Ports 0x70 and 0x71. It does this with actual I/O
instructions and consequently can only do it if running with
superuser effective userid. (In the case of a Jensen Alpha,
there is no way for <b>hwclock</b> to execute those I/O
instructions, and so it uses instead the /dev/port device
special file, which provides almost as low-level an
interface to the I/O subsystem).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This is a
really poor method of accessing the clock, for all the
reasons that user space programs are generally not supposed
to do direct I/O and disable interrupts. Hwclock provides it
because it is the only method available on ISA and Alpha
systems which don&rsquo;t have working rtc device drivers
available.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On an m68k
system, <b>hwclock</b> can access the clock via the console
driver, via the device special file /dev/tty1.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>hwclock</b>
tries to use /dev/rtc. If it is compiled for a kernel that
doesn&rsquo;t have that function or it is unable to open
/dev/rtc (or the alternative special file you&rsquo;ve
defined on the command line) <b>hwclock</b> will fall back
to another method, if available. On an ISA or Alpha machine,
you can force <b>hwclock</b> to use the direct manipulation
of the CMOS registers without even trying <i>/dev/rtc</i> by
specifying the <b>&minus;&minus;directisa</b> option.</p>

<h2>The Adjust Function
<a name="The Adjust Function"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The Hardware
Clock is usually not very accurate. However, much of its
inaccuracy is completely predictable - it gains or loses the
same amount of time every day. This is called systematic
drift. <b>hwclock</b>&rsquo;s &quot;adjust&quot; function
lets you make systematic corrections to correct the
systematic drift.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It works like
this: <b>hwclock</b> keeps a file, <i>/etc/adjtime</i>, that
keeps some historical information. This is called the
adjtime file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Suppose you
start with no adjtime file. You issue a <i>hwclock
&minus;&minus;set</i> command to set the Hardware Clock to
the true current time. <b>Hwclock</b> creates the adjtime
file and records in it the current time as the last time the
clock was calibrated. 5 days later, the clock has gained 10
seconds, so you issue another <i>hwclock
&minus;&minus;set</i> command to set it back 10 seconds.
<b>Hwclock</b> updates the adjtime file to show the current
time as the last time the clock was calibrated, and records
2 seconds per day as the systematic drift rate. 24 hours go
by, and then you issue a <i>hwclock &minus;&minus;adjust</i>
command. <b>Hwclock</b> consults the adjtime file and sees
that the clock gains 2 seconds per day when left alone and
that it has been left alone for exactly one day. So it
subtracts 2 seconds from the Hardware Clock. It then records
the current time as the last time the clock was adjusted.
Another 24 hours goes by and you issue another <i>hwclock
&minus;&minus;adjust</i>. <b>Hwclock</b> does the same
thing: subtracts 2 seconds and updates the adjtime file with
the current time as the last time the clock was
adjusted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Every time you
calibrate (set) the clock (using <i>&minus;&minus;set</i> or
<i>&minus;&minus;systohc</i>), <b>hwclock</b> recalculates
the systematic drift rate based on how long it has been
since the last calibration, how long it has been since the
last adjustment, what drift rate was assumed in any
intervening adjustments, and the amount by which the clock
is presently off.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A small amount
of error creeps in any time <b>hwclock</b> sets the clock,
so it refrains from making an adjustment that would be less
than 1 second. Later on, when you request an adjustment
again, the accumulated drift will be more than a second and
<b>hwclock</b> will do the adjustment then.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is good to
do a <i>hwclock &minus;&minus;adjust</i> just before the
<i>hwclock &minus;&minus;hctosys</i> at system startup time,
and maybe periodically while the system is running via
cron.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The adjtime
file, while named for its historical purpose of controlling
adjustments only, actually contains other information for
use by hwclock in remembering information from one
invocation to the next.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The format of
the adjtime file is, in ASCII:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Line 1: 3
numbers, separated by blanks: 1) systematic drift rate in
seconds per day, floating point decimal; 2) Resulting number
of seconds since 1969 UTC of most recent adjustment or
calibration, decimal integer; 3) zero (for compatibility
with <b>clock</b>(8)) as a decimal integer.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Line 2: 1
number: Resulting number of seconds since 1969 UTC of most
recent calibration. Zero if there has been no calibration
yet or it is known that any previous calibration is moot
(for example, because the Hardware Clock has been found,
since that calibration, not to contain a valid time). This
is a decimal integer.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Line 3:
&quot;UTC&quot; or &quot;LOCAL&quot;. Tells whether the
Hardware Clock is set to Coordinated Universal Time or local
time. You can always override this value with options on the
<b>hwclock</b> command line.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can use an
adjtime file that was previously used with the
<b>clock</b>(8) program with <b>hwclock</b>.</p>

<h2>Automatic Hardware Clock Synchronization By the Kernel
<a name="Automatic Hardware Clock Synchronization By the Kernel"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You should be
aware of another way that the Hardware Clock is kept
synchronized in some systems. The Linux kernel has a mode
wherein it copies the System Time to the Hardware Clock
every 11 minutes. This is a good mode to use when you are
using something sophisticated like ntp to keep your System
Time synchronized. (ntp is a way to keep your System Time
synchronized either to a time server somewhere on the
network or to a radio clock hooked up to your system. See
RFC 1305).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This mode
(we&rsquo;ll call it &quot;11 minute mode&quot;) is off
until something turns it on. The ntp daemon xntpd is one
thing that turns it on. You can turn it off by running
anything, including <i>hwclock &minus;&minus;hctosys</i>,
that sets the System Time the old fashioned way.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If your system
runs with 11 minute mode on, don&rsquo;t use <i>hwclock
&minus;&minus;adjust</i> or <i>hwclock
&minus;&minus;hctosys</i>. You&rsquo;ll just make a mess. It
is acceptable to use a <i>hwclock &minus;&minus;hctosys</i>
at startup time to get a reasonable System Time until your
system is able to set the System Time from the external
source and start 11 minute mode.</p>

<h2>ISA Hardware Clock Century value
<a name="ISA Hardware Clock Century value"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There is some
sort of standard that defines CMOS memory Byte 50 on an ISA
machine as an indicator of what century it is.
<b>hwclock</b> does not use or set that byte because there
are some machines that don&rsquo;t define the byte that way,
and it really isn&rsquo;t necessary anyway, since the
year-of-century does a good job of implying which century it
is.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you have a
bona fide use for a CMOS century byte, contact the
<b>hwclock</b> maintainer; an option may be appropriate.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that this
section is only relevant when you are using the &quot;direct
ISA&quot; method of accessing the Hardware Clock. ACPI
provides a standard way to access century values, when they
are supported by the hardware.</p>
