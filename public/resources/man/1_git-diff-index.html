<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">git-diff-index
&minus; Compares content and mode of blobs between the index
and repository</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>git
diff&minus;index</i> [&minus;m] [&minus;&minus;cached]
[&lt;common diff options&gt;] &lt;tree&minus;ish&gt;
[&lt;path&gt;...]</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Compares the
content and mode of the blobs found via a tree object with
the content of the current index and, optionally ignoring
the stat state of the file on disk. When paths are
specified, compares only those named paths. Otherwise all
entries in the index are compared.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;p,
&minus;u, &minus;&minus;patch</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Generate patch (see section on
generating patches).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;U&lt;n&gt;,
&minus;&minus;unified=&lt;n&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Generate diffs with &lt;n&gt;
lines of context instead of the usual three. Implies
&minus;p.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;raw</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Generate the raw format. This
is the default.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;patch&minus;with&minus;raw</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Synonym for &minus;p
&minus;&minus;raw.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;minimal</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Spend extra time to make sure
the smallest possible diff is produced.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;patience</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Generate a diff using the
&quot;patience diff&quot; algorithm.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;histogram</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Generate a diff using the
&quot;histogram diff&quot; algorithm.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;diff&minus;algorithm={patience|minimal|histogram|myers}</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Choose a diff algorithm. The
variants are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">default,
myers</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">The basic greedy diff
algorithm. Currently, this is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">minimal</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">Spend extra time to make sure
the smallest possible diff is produced.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">patience</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">Use &quot;patience diff&quot;
algorithm when generating patches.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">histogram</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">This algorithm extends the
patience algorithm to &quot;support low&minus;occurrence
common elements&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">For instance,
if you configured diff.algorithm variable to a
non&minus;default value and want to use the default one,
then you have to use
&minus;&minus;diff&minus;algorithm=default option.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;stat[=&lt;width&gt;[,&lt;name&minus;width&gt;[,&lt;count&gt;]]]</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Generate a diffstat. By
default, as much space as necessary will be used for the
filename part, and the rest for the graph part. Maximum
width defaults to terminal width, or 80 columns if not
connected to a terminal, and can be overridden by
&lt;width&gt;. The width of the filename part can be limited
by giving another width &lt;name&minus;width&gt; after a
comma. The width of the graph part can be limited by using
&minus;&minus;stat&minus;graph&minus;width=&lt;width&gt;
(affects all commands generating a stat graph) or by setting
diff.statGraphWidth=&lt;width&gt; (does not affect git
format&minus;patch). By giving a third parameter
&lt;count&gt;, you can limit the output to the first
&lt;count&gt; lines, followed by ... if there are more.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">These
parameters can also be set individually with
&minus;&minus;stat&minus;width=&lt;width&gt;,
&minus;&minus;stat&minus;name&minus;width=&lt;name&minus;width&gt;
and &minus;&minus;stat&minus;count=&lt;count&gt;.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;numstat</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Similar to &minus;&minus;stat,
but shows number of added and deleted lines in decimal
notation and pathname without abbreviation, to make it more
machine friendly. For binary files, outputs two &minus;
instead of saying 0 0.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;shortstat</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Output only the last line of
the &minus;&minus;stat format containing total number of
modified files, as well as number of added and deleted
lines.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;dirstat[=&lt;param1,param2,...&gt;]</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Output the distribution of
relative amount of changes for each sub&minus;directory. The
behavior of &minus;&minus;dirstat can be customized by
passing it a comma separated list of parameters. The
defaults are controlled by the diff.dirstat configuration
variable (see <b>git-config</b>(1)). The following
parameters are available:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">changes</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">Compute the dirstat numbers by
counting the lines that have been removed from the source,
or added to the destination. This ignores the amount of pure
code movements within a file. In other words, rearranging
lines in a file is not counted as much as other changes.
This is the default behavior when no parameter is given.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">lines</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">Compute the dirstat numbers by
doing the regular line&minus;based diff analysis, and
summing the removed/added line counts. (For binary files,
count 64&minus;byte chunks instead, since binary files have
no natural concept of lines). This is a more expensive
&minus;&minus;dirstat behavior than the changes behavior,
but it does count rearranged lines within a file as much as
other changes. The resulting output is consistent with what
you get from the other &minus;&minus;*stat options.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">files</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">Compute the dirstat numbers by
counting the number of files changed. Each changed file
counts equally in the dirstat analysis. This is the
computationally cheapest &minus;&minus;dirstat behavior,
since it does not have to look at the file contents at
all.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">cumulative</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">Count changes in a child
directory for the parent directory as well. Note that when
using cumulative, the sum of the percentages reported may
exceed 100%. The default (non&minus;cumulative) behavior can
be specified with the noncumulative parameter.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&lt;limit&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">An integer parameter specifies
a cut&minus;off percent (3% by default). Directories
contributing less than this percentage of the changes are
not shown in the output.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Example: The
following will count changed files, while ignoring
directories with less than 10% of the total amount of
changed files, and accumulating child directory counts in
the parent directories:
&minus;&minus;dirstat=files,10,cumulative.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;summary</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Output a condensed summary of
extended header information such as creations, renames and
mode changes.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;patch&minus;with&minus;stat</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Synonym for &minus;p
&minus;&minus;stat.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;z</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When &minus;&minus;raw,
&minus;&minus;numstat, &minus;&minus;name&minus;only or
&minus;&minus;name&minus;status has been given, do not munge
pathnames and use NULs as output field terminators.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Without this
option, each pathname output will have TAB, LF, double
quotes, and backslash characters replaced with \t, \n,
\&quot;, and \\, respectively, and the pathname will be
enclosed in double quotes if any of those replacements
occurred.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;name&minus;only</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Show only names of changed
files.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;name&minus;status</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Show only names and status of
changed files. See the description of the
&minus;&minus;diff&minus;filter option on what the status
letters mean.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;submodule[=&lt;format&gt;]</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Specify how differences in
submodules are shown. When &minus;&minus;submodule or
&minus;&minus;submodule=log is given, the <i>log</i> format
is used. This format lists the commits in the range like
<b>git-submodule</b>(1)summary does. Omitting the
&minus;&minus;submodule option or specifying
&minus;&minus;submodule=short, uses the <i>short</i> format.
This format just shows the names of the commits at the
beginning and end of the range. Can be tweaked via the
diff.submodule configuration variable.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;color[=&lt;when&gt;]</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Show colored diff.
&minus;&minus;color (i.e. without <i>=&lt;when&gt;</i>) is
the same as &minus;&minus;color=always. <i>&lt;when&gt;</i>
can be one of always, never, or auto.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;no&minus;color</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Turn off colored diff. It is
the same as &minus;&minus;color=never.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;word&minus;diff[=&lt;mode&gt;]</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Show a word diff, using the
&lt;mode&gt; to delimit changed words. By default, words are
delimited by whitespace; see
&minus;&minus;word&minus;diff&minus;regex below. The
&lt;mode&gt; defaults to <i>plain</i>, and must be one
of:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">color</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">Highlight changed words using
only colors. Implies &minus;&minus;color.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">plain</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">Show words as
[&minus;removed&minus;] and {+added+}. Makes no attempts to
escape the delimiters if they appear in the input, so the
output may be ambiguous.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">porcelain</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">Use a special line&minus;based
format intended for script consumption.
Added/removed/unchanged runs are printed in the usual
unified diff format, starting with a +/&minus;/&lsquo;
&lsquo; character at the beginning of the line and extending
to the end of the line. Newlines in the input are
represented by a tilde ~ on a line of its own.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">none</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">Disable word diff again.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
despite the name of the first mode, color is used to
highlight the changed parts in all modes if enabled.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;word&minus;diff&minus;regex=&lt;regex&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Use &lt;regex&gt; to decide
what a word is, instead of considering runs of
non&minus;whitespace to be a word. Also implies
&minus;&minus;word&minus;diff unless it was already
enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Every
non&minus;overlapping match of the &lt;regex&gt; is
considered a word. Anything between these matches is
considered whitespace and ignored(!) for the purposes of
finding differences. You may want to append |[^[:space:]] to
your regular expression to make sure that it matches all
non&minus;whitespace characters. A match that contains a
newline is silently truncated(!) at the newline.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The regex can
also be set via a diff driver or configuration option, see
<b>gitattributes</b>(1) or <b>git-config</b>(1). Giving it
explicitly overrides any diff driver or configuration
setting. Diff drivers override configuration settings.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;color&minus;words[=&lt;regex&gt;]</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Equivalent to
&minus;&minus;word&minus;diff=color plus (if a regex was
specified)
&minus;&minus;word&minus;diff&minus;regex=&lt;regex&gt;.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;no&minus;renames</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Turn off rename detection, even
when the configuration file gives the default to do so.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;check</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Warn if changes introduce
whitespace errors. What are considered whitespace errors is
controlled by core.whitespace configuration. By default,
trailing whitespaces (including lines that solely consist of
whitespaces) and a space character that is immediately
followed by a tab character inside the initial indent of the
line are considered whitespace errors. Exits with
non&minus;zero status if problems are found. Not compatible
with &minus;&minus;exit&minus;code.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;full&minus;index</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Instead of the first handful of
characters, show the full pre&minus; and post&minus;image
blob object names on the &quot;index&quot; line when
generating patch format output.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;binary</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">In addition to
&minus;&minus;full&minus;index, output a binary diff that
can be applied with git&minus;apply.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;abbrev[=&lt;n&gt;]</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Instead of showing the full
40&minus;byte hexadecimal object name in diff&minus;raw
format output and diff&minus;tree header lines, show only a
partial prefix. This is independent of the
&minus;&minus;full&minus;index option above, which controls
the diff&minus;patch output format. Non default number of
digits can be specified with
&minus;&minus;abbrev=&lt;n&gt;.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;B[&lt;n&gt;][/&lt;m&gt;],
&minus;&minus;break&minus;rewrites[=[&lt;n&gt;][/&lt;m&gt;]]</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Break complete rewrite changes
into pairs of delete and create. This serves two
purposes:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">It affects the
way a change that amounts to a total rewrite of a file not
as a series of deletion and insertion mixed together with a
very few lines that happen to match textually as the
context, but as a single deletion of everything old followed
by a single insertion of everything new, and the number m
controls this aspect of the &minus;B option (defaults to
60%). &minus;B/70% specifies that less than 30% of the
original should remain in the result for Git to consider it
a total rewrite (i.e. otherwise the resulting patch will be
a series of deletion and insertion mixed together with
context lines).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">When used with
&minus;M, a totally&minus;rewritten file is also considered
as the source of a rename (usually &minus;M only considers a
file that disappeared as the source of a rename), and the
number n controls this aspect of the &minus;B option
(defaults to 50%). &minus;B20% specifies that a change with
addition and deletion compared to 20% or more of the
file&rsquo;s size are eligible for being picked up as a
possible source of a rename to another file.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;M[&lt;n&gt;],
&minus;&minus;find&minus;renames[=&lt;n&gt;]</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Detect renames. If n is
specified, it is a threshold on the similarity index (i.e.
amount of addition/deletions compared to the file&rsquo;s
size). For example, &minus;M90% means Git should consider a
delete/add pair to be a rename if more than 90% of the file
hasn&rsquo;t changed. Without a % sign, the number is to be
read as a fraction, with a decimal point before it. I.e.,
&minus;M5 becomes 0.5, and is thus the same as &minus;M50%.
Similarly, &minus;M05 is the same as &minus;M5%. To limit
detection to exact renames, use &minus;M100%.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;C[&lt;n&gt;],
&minus;&minus;find&minus;copies[=&lt;n&gt;]</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Detect copies as well as
renames. See also
&minus;&minus;find&minus;copies&minus;harder. If n is
specified, it has the same meaning as for
&minus;M&lt;n&gt;.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;find&minus;copies&minus;harder</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">For performance reasons, by
default, &minus;C option finds copies only if the original
file of the copy was modified in the same changeset. This
flag makes the command inspect unmodified files as
candidates for the source of copy. This is a very expensive
operation for large projects, so use it with caution. Giving
more than one &minus;C option has the same effect.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;D,
&minus;&minus;irreversible&minus;delete</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Omit the preimage for deletes,
i.e. print only the header but not the diff between the
preimage and /dev/null. The resulting patch is not meant to
be applied with patch nor git apply; this is solely for
people who want to just concentrate on reviewing the text
after the change. In addition, the output obviously lack
enough information to apply such a patch in reverse, even
manually, hence the name of the option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">When used
together with &minus;B, omit also the preimage in the
deletion part of a delete/create pair.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;l&lt;num&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The &minus;M and &minus;C
options require O(n^2) processing time where n is the number
of potential rename/copy targets. This option prevents
rename/copy detection from running if the number of
rename/copy targets exceeds the specified number.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;diff&minus;filter=[(A|C|D|M|R|T|U|X|B)...[*]]</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Select only files that are
Added (A), Copied (C), Deleted (D), Modified (M), Renamed
(R), have their type (i.e. regular file, symlink, submodule,
...) changed (T), are Unmerged (U), are Unknown (X), or have
had their pairing Broken (B). Any combination of the filter
characters (including none) can be used. When *
(All&minus;or&minus;none) is added to the combination, all
paths are selected if there is any file that matches other
criteria in the comparison; if there is no file that matches
other criteria, nothing is selected.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;S&lt;string&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Look for differences that
introduce or remove an instance of &lt;string&gt;. Note that
this is different than the string simply appearing in diff
output; see the <i>pickaxe</i> entry in
<b>gitdiffcore</b>(7) for more details.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;G&lt;regex&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Look for differences whose
added or removed line matches the given &lt;regex&gt;.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;pickaxe&minus;all</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When &minus;S or &minus;G finds
a change, show all the changes in that changeset, not just
the files that contain the change in &lt;string&gt;.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;pickaxe&minus;regex</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Make the &lt;string&gt; not a
plain string but an extended POSIX regex to match.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;O&lt;orderfile&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Output the patch in the order
specified in the &lt;orderfile&gt;, which has one shell glob
pattern per line.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;R</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Swap two inputs; that is, show
differences from index or on&minus;disk file to tree
contents.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;relative[=&lt;path&gt;]</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When run from a subdirectory of
the project, it can be told to exclude changes outside the
directory and show pathnames relative to it with this
option. When you are not in a subdirectory (e.g. in a bare
repository), you can name which subdirectory to make the
output relative to by giving a &lt;path&gt; as an
argument.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;a,
&minus;&minus;text</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Treat all files as text.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;ignore&minus;space&minus;at&minus;eol</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Ignore changes in whitespace at
EOL.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;b,
&minus;&minus;ignore&minus;space&minus;change</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Ignore changes in amount of
whitespace. This ignores whitespace at line end, and
considers all other sequences of one or more whitespace
characters to be equivalent.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;w,
&minus;&minus;ignore&minus;all&minus;space</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Ignore whitespace when
comparing lines. This ignores differences even if one line
has whitespace where the other line has none.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;inter&minus;hunk&minus;context=&lt;lines&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Show the context between diff
hunks, up to the specified number of lines, thereby fusing
hunks that are close to each other.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;W,
&minus;&minus;function&minus;context</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Show whole surrounding
functions of changes.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;exit&minus;code</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Make the program exit with
codes similar to diff(1). That is, it exits with 1 if there
were differences and 0 means no differences.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;quiet</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Disable all output of the
program. Implies &minus;&minus;exit&minus;code.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;ext&minus;diff</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Allow an external diff helper
to be executed. If you set an external diff driver with
<b>gitattributes</b>(5), you need to use this option with
<b>git-log</b>(1) and friends.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;no&minus;ext&minus;diff</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Disallow external diff
drivers.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;textconv,
&minus;&minus;no&minus;textconv</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Allow (or disallow) external
text conversion filters to be run when comparing binary
files. See <b>gitattributes</b>(5) for details. Because
textconv filters are typically a one&minus;way conversion,
the resulting diff is suitable for human consumption, but
cannot be applied. For this reason, textconv filters are
enabled by default only for <b>git-diff</b>(1) and
<b>git-log</b>(1), but not for <b>git-format-patch</b>(1) or
diff plumbing commands.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;ignore&minus;submodules[=&lt;when&gt;]</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Ignore changes to submodules in
the diff generation. &lt;when&gt; can be either
&quot;none&quot;, &quot;untracked&quot;, &quot;dirty&quot;
or &quot;all&quot;, which is the default. Using
&quot;none&quot; will consider the submodule modified when
it either contains untracked or modified files or its HEAD
differs from the commit recorded in the superproject and can
be used to override any settings of the <i>ignore</i> option
in <b>git-config</b>(1) or <b>gitmodules</b>(5). When
&quot;untracked&quot; is used submodules are not considered
dirty when they only contain untracked content (but they are
still scanned for modified content). Using &quot;dirty&quot;
ignores all changes to the work tree of submodules, only
changes to the commits stored in the superproject are shown
(this was the behavior until 1.7.0). Using &quot;all&quot;
hides all changes to submodules.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;src&minus;prefix=&lt;prefix&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Show the given source prefix

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;dst&minus;prefix=&lt;prefix&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Show the given destination
prefix instead of &quot;b/&quot;.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;no&minus;prefix</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Do not show any source or
destination prefix.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For more

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;m</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">By default, files recorded in

&quot;git&minus;diff&minus;files&quot; and
&quot;git&minus;diff &minus;&minus;raw&quot; can take
<i>&minus;c</i> or <i>&minus;&minus;cc</i> option to

<h2>GENERATING PATCHES WITH -P
<a name="GENERATING PATCHES WITH -P"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When
&quot;git&minus;diff&minus;index&quot;,
&quot;git&minus;diff&minus;tree&quot;, or
&quot;git&minus;diff&minus;files&quot; are run with a
<i>&minus;p</i> option, &quot;git diff&quot; without the
<i>&minus;&minus;raw</i> option, or &quot;git log&quot; with
the &quot;&minus;p&quot; option, they do not produce the
output described above; instead they produce a patch file.
You can customize the creation of such patches via the
GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF and the GIT_DIFF_OPTS environment
variables.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">What the
&minus;p option produces is slightly different from the
traditional diff format:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">1. It is
preceded with a &quot;git diff&quot; header that looks like
this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">diff
&minus;&minus;git a/file1 b/file2</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The a/ and b/
filenames are the same unless rename/copy is involved.
Especially, even for a creation or a deletion, /dev/null is
<i>not</i> used in place of the a/ or b/ filenames.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">When
rename/copy is involved, file1 and file2 show the name of
the source file of the rename/copy and the name of the file
that rename/copy produces, respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">2. It is
followed by one or more extended header lines:</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">old mode
&lt;mode&gt; <br>
new mode &lt;mode&gt; <br>
deleted file mode &lt;mode&gt; <br>
new file mode &lt;mode&gt; <br>
copy from &lt;path&gt; <br>
copy to &lt;path&gt; <br>
rename from &lt;path&gt; <br>
rename to &lt;path&gt; <br>
similarity index &lt;number&gt; <br>
dissimilarity index &lt;number&gt; <br>
index &lt;hash&gt;..&lt;hash&gt; &lt;mode&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">File modes are
printed as 6&minus;digit octal numbers including the file
type and file permission bits.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Path names in
extended headers do not include the a/ and b/ prefixes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The similarity
index is the percentage of unchanged lines, and the
dissimilarity index is the percentage of changed lines. It
is a rounded down integer, followed by a percent sign. The
similarity index value of 100% is thus reserved for two
equal files, while 100% dissimilarity means that no line
from the old file made it into the new one.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The index line
includes the SHA&minus;1 checksum before and after the
change. The &lt;mode&gt; is included if the file mode does
not change; otherwise, separate lines indicate the old and
the new mode.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">3. TAB, LF,
double quote and backslash characters in pathnames are
represented as \t, \n, \&quot; and \\, respectively. If
there is need for such substitution then the whole pathname
is put in double quotes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">4. All the
file1 files in the output refer to files before the commit,
and all the file2 files refer to files after the commit. It
is incorrect to apply each change to each file sequentially.
For example, this patch will swap a and b:</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">diff
&minus;&minus;git a/a b/b <br>
rename from a <br>
rename to b <br>
diff &minus;&minus;git a/b b/a <br>
rename from b <br>
rename to a</p>

<h2>COMBINED DIFF FORMAT
<a name="COMBINED DIFF FORMAT"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Any
diff&minus;generating command can take the
&lsquo;&minus;c&lsquo; or &minus;&minus;cc option to produce
a <i>combined diff</i> when showing a merge. This is the
default format when showing merges with <b>git-diff</b>(1)
or <b>git-show</b>(1). Note also that you can give the
&lsquo;&minus;m&rsquo; option to any of these commands to
force generation of diffs with individual parents of a
merge.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A <i>combined

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">1. It is

this (when <i>&minus;c</i> option is used):</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">diff
&minus;&minus;combined file</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">or like this
(when <i>&minus;&minus;cc</i> option is used):</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">diff
&minus;&minus;cc file</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">2. It is
followed by one or more extended header lines (this example
shows a merge with two parents):</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">index
&lt;hash&gt;,&lt;hash&gt;..&lt;hash&gt; <br>
mode &lt;mode&gt;,&lt;mode&gt;..&lt;mode&gt; <br>
new file mode &lt;mode&gt; <br>
deleted file mode &lt;mode&gt;,&lt;mode&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The mode
&lt;mode&gt;,&lt;mode&gt;..&lt;mode&gt; line appears only if
at least one of the &lt;mode&gt; is different from the rest.
Extended headers with information about detected contents
movement (renames and copying detection) are designed to
work with diff of two &lt;tree&minus;ish&gt; and are not
used by combined diff format.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">3. It is
followed by two&minus;line from&minus;file/to&minus;file
header</p>


<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;&minus;
a/file <br>
+++ b/file</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Similar to
two&minus;line header for traditional <i>unified</i> diff
format, /dev/null is used to signal created or deleted
files.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">4. Chunk header
format is modified to prevent people from accidentally
feeding it to patch &minus;p1. Combined diff format was
created for review of merge commit changes, and was not
meant for apply. The change is similar to the change in the
extended <i>index</i> header:</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">@@@
&lt;from&minus;file&minus;range&gt;
&lt;from&minus;file&minus;range&gt;
&lt;to&minus;file&minus;range&gt; @@@</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">There are
(number of parents + 1) @ characters in the chunk header for
combined diff format.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Unlike the
traditional <i>unified</i> diff format, which shows two
files A and B with a single column that has &minus; (minus
&mdash; appears in A but removed in B), + (plus &mdash;
missing in A but added to B), or &quot; &quot; (space
&mdash; unchanged) prefix, this format compares two or more
files file1, file2,... with one file X, and shows how X
differs from each of fileN. One column for each of fileN is
prepended to the output line to note how X&rsquo;s line is
different from it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A &minus;
character in the column N means that the line appears in
fileN but it does not appear in the result. A + character in
the column N means that the line appears in the result, and
fileN does not have that line (in other words, the line was
added, from the point of view of that parent).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In the above
example output, the function signature was changed from both
files (hence two &minus; removals from both file1 and file2,
plus ++ to mean one line that was added does not appear in
either file1 nor file2). Also eight other lines are the same
from file1 but do not appear in file2 (hence prefixed with
+).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When shown by
git diff&minus;tree &minus;c, it compares the parents of a
merge commit with the merge result (i.e. file1..fileN are
the parents). When shown by git diff&minus;files &minus;c,
it compares the two unresolved merge parents with the
working tree file (i.e. file1 is stage 2 aka &quot;our
version&quot;, file2 is stage 3 aka &quot;their
version&quot;).</p>

<h2>OTHER DIFF FORMATS

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
&minus;&minus;summary option describes newly added, deleted,
renamed and copied files. The &minus;&minus;stat option adds
diffstat(1) graph to the output. These options can be
combined with other options, such as &minus;p, and are meant
for human consumption.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When showing a
change that involves a rename or a copy, &minus;&minus;stat
output formats the pathnames compactly by combining common
prefix and suffix of the pathnames. For example, a change
that moves arch/i386/Makefile to arch/x86/Makefile while
modifying 4 lines will be shown like this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">arch/{i386

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">9. a NUL.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The extra NUL
before the preimage path in renamed case is to allow scripts
that read the output to tell if the current record being
read is a single&minus;path record or a rename/copy record
without reading ahead. After reading added and deleted
lines, reading up to NUL would yield the pathname, but if

<a name="OPERATING MODES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can choose
whether you want to trust the index file entirely (using the
<i>&minus;&minus;cached</i> flag) or ask the diff logic to
show any files that don&rsquo;t match the stat state as
being &quot;tentatively changed&quot;. Both of these
operations are very useful indeed.</p>

<h2>CACHED MODE
<a name="CACHED MODE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If
<i>&minus;&minus;cached</i> is specified, it allows you to
ask:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">show me the
differences between HEAD and the current index <br>
contents (the ones I'd write using 'git
write&minus;tree')</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For example,
let&rsquo;s say that you have worked on your working
directory, updated some files in the index and are ready to
commit. You want to see exactly <b>what</b> you are going to
commit, without having to write a new tree object and
compare it that way, and to do that, you just do</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">git
diff&minus;index &minus;&minus;cached HEAD</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Example:
let&rsquo;s say I had renamed commit.c to
git&minus;commit.c, and I had done an update&minus;index to
make that effective in the index file. git diff&minus;files
wouldn&rsquo;t show anything at all, since the index file
matches my working directory. But doing a <i>git
diff&minus;index</i> does:</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">torvalds@ppc970:~/git&gt;
git diff&minus;index &minus;&minus;cached HEAD <br>
&minus;100644 blob 4161aecc6700a2eb579e842af0b7f22b98443f74
commit.c <br>
+100644 blob 4161aecc6700a2eb579e842af0b7f22b98443f74
git&minus;commit.c</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can see
easily that the above is a rename.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In fact, git
diff&minus;index &minus;&minus;cached <b>should</b> always
be entirely equivalent to actually doing a <i>git
write&minus;tree</i> and comparing that. Except this one is
much nicer for the case where you just want to check where
you are.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">So doing a git
diff&minus;index &minus;&minus;cached is basically very
useful when you are asking yourself &quot;what have I
already marked for being committed, and what&rsquo;s the
difference to a previous tree&quot;.</p>

<h2>NON-CACHED MODE
<a name="NON-CACHED MODE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;non&minus;cached&quot; mode takes a different
approach, and is potentially the more useful of the two in
that what it does can&rsquo;t be emulated with a <i>git
write&minus;tree</i> + <i>git diff&minus;tree</i>. Thus
that&rsquo;s the default mode. The non&minus;cached version
asks the question:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">show me the
differences between HEAD and the currently checked out <br>
tree &minus; index contents _and_ files that aren't
up&minus;to&minus;date</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">which is
obviously a very useful question too, since that tells you
what you <b>could</b> commit. Again, the output matches the
<i>git diff&minus;tree &minus;r</i> output to a tee, but
with a twist.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The twist is
that if some file doesn&rsquo;t match the index, we
don&rsquo;t have a backing store thing for it, and we use
the magic &quot;all&minus;zero&quot; sha1 to show that. So
let&rsquo;s say that you have edited kernel/sched.c, but
have not actually done a <i>git update&minus;index</i> on it
yet &minus; there is no &quot;object&quot; associated with
the new state, and you get:</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">torvalds@ppc970:~/v2.6/linux&gt;
git diff&minus;index &minus;&minus;abbrev HEAD <br>
:100644 100664 7476bb... 000000... kernel/sched.c</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">i.e., it shows
that the tree has changed, and that kernel/sched.c has is
not up&minus;to&minus;date and may contain new stuff. The
all&minus;zero sha1 means that to get the real diff, you
need to look at the object in the working directory directly
rather than do an object&minus;to&minus;object diff.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><b><big>Note</big></b>
<br>
As with other commands of this type, <i>git
diff&minus;index</i> does not actually look at the contents
of the file at all. So maybe kernel/sched.c hasn&rsquo;t
actually changed, and it&rsquo;s just that you touched it.
In either case, it&rsquo;s a note that you need to <i>git
update&minus;index</i> it to make the index be in sync.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><b><big>Note</big></b>
<br>
You can have a mixture of files show up as &quot;has been
updated&quot; and &quot;is still dirty in the working
directory&quot; together. You can always tell which file is
in which state, since the &quot;has been updated&quot; ones
show a valid sha1, and the &quot;not in sync with the
index&quot; ones will always have the special all&minus;zero
sha1.</p>
