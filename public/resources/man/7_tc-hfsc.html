Hierarchical Fair Service Curve</p>

<h2>HISTORY &amp; INTRODUCTION

</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">HFSC
(Hierarchical Fair Service Curve) is a network packet
scheduling algorithm that was first presented at
SIGCOMM&rsquo;97. Developed as a part of ALTQ (ALTernative
Queuing) on NetBSD, found its way quickly to other BSD
systems, and then a few years ago became part of the linux
kernel. Still, it&rsquo;s not the most popular scheduling
algorithm &minus; especially if compared to HTB &minus; and
it&rsquo;s not well documented for the enduser. This
introduction aims to explain how HFSC works without using
too much math (although some math it will be
inevitable).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In short HFSC
aims to:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The main
&quot;selling&quot; point of HFSC is feature <b>(1)</b>,
which is achieved by using nonlinear service curves (more
about what it actually is later). This is particularly
useful in VoIP or games, where not only a guarantee of
consistent bandwidth is important, but also limiting the
initial delay of a data stream. Note that it matters only
for leaf classes (where the actual queues are) &minus; thus
class hierarchy is ignored in the realtime case.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Feature
<b>(2)</b> is well, obvious &minus; any algorithm featuring
class hierarchy (such as HTB or CBQ) strives to achieve
that. HFSC does that well, although you might end with
unusual situations, if you define service curves carelessly
&minus; see section CORNER CASES for examples.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Feature
<b>(3)</b> is mentioned due to the nature of the problem.
There may be situations where it&rsquo;s either not possible
to guarantee service of all curves at the same time, and/or
it&rsquo;s impossible to do so fairly. Both will be
explained later. Note that this is mainly related to
interior (aka aggregate) classes, as the leafs are already
handled by <b>(1)</b>. Still, it&rsquo;s perfectly possible
to create a leaf class without realtime service, and in such
a case the caveats will naturally extend to leaf classes as
well.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For the

<h2>BASICS OF HFSC
<a name="BASICS OF HFSC"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To understand
how HFSC works, we must first introduce a service curve.
Overall, it&rsquo;s a nondecreasing function of some time
unit, returning the amount of service (an allowed or
allocated amount of bandwidth) at some specific point in
time. The purpose of it should be subconsciously obvious: if
a class was allowed to transfer not less than the amount
specified by its service curve, then the service curve is
not violated.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Still, we need
more elaborate criterion than just the above (although in
the most generic case it can be reduced to it). The
criterion has to take two things into account:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="17%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&bull;</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="77%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">idling periods</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="17%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>&bull;</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="77%">


<p>the ability to &quot;look back&quot;, so if during
current active period the service curve is violated, maybe
it isn&rsquo;t if we count excess bandwidth received during
earlier active period(s)</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Let&rsquo;s
define the criterion as follows:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="17%"></td>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>(1)</b></p></td>
<td width="1%"></td>
<td width="77%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">For each t1, there must exist t0
in set B, so S(t1&minus;t0)&nbsp;&lt;=&nbsp;w(t0,t1)</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Here
&rsquo;w&rsquo; denotes the amount of service received
during some time period between t0 and t1. B is a set of all
times, where a session becomes active after idling period
(further denoted as &rsquo;becoming backlogged&rsquo;). For
a clearer picture, imagine two situations:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="17%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>a)</b></p></td>
<td width="3%"></td>
<td width="77%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">our session was active during
two periods, with a small time gap between them</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="17%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p><b>b)</b></p></td>
<td width="3%"></td>
<td width="77%">


<p>as in (a), but with a larger gap</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Consider
<b>(a)</b>: if the service received during both periods
meets <b>(1)</b>, then all is well. But what if it
doesn&rsquo;t do so during the 2nd period? If the amount of
service received during the 1st period is larger than the
service curve, then it might compensate for smaller service
during the 2nd period <i>and</i> the gap &minus; if the gap
is small enough.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the gap is
larger <b>(b)</b> &minus; then it&rsquo;s less likely to
happen (unless the excess bandwidth allocated during the 1st
part was really large). Still, the larger the gap &minus;
the less interesting is what happened in the past (e.g. 10
minutes ago) &minus; what matters is the current traffic
that just started.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">From
HFSC&rsquo;s perspective, more interesting is answering the
following question: when should we start transferring
packets, so a service curve of a class is not violated. Or
rephrasing it: How much X() amount of service should a
session receive by time t, so the service curve is not
violated. Function X() defined as below is the basic
building block of HFSC, used in: eligible, deadline,
virtual&minus;time and fit&minus;time curves. Of course, X()
is based on equation <b>(1)</b> and is defined
recursively:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="17%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&bull;</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="77%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">At the 1st backlogged period
beginning function X is initialized to generic service curve
assigned to a class</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="17%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>&bull;</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="77%">


<p>At any subsequent backlogged period, X() is:</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:23%;"><b>min(X() from previous period
; w(t0)+S(t&minus;t0) for t&gt;=t0),</b> <br>
... where t0 denotes the beginning of the current backlogged
period.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">HFSC uses
either linear, or two&minus;piece linear service curves. In
case of linear or two&minus;piece linear convex functions
(first slope &lt; second slope), min() in X&rsquo;s
definition reduces to the 2nd argument. But in case of
two&minus;piece concave functions, the 1st argument might
quickly become lesser for some t&gt;=t0. Note, that for some
backlogged period, X() is defined only from that
period&rsquo;s beginning. We also define X^(&minus;1)(w) as
smallest t&gt;=t0, for which X(t)&nbsp;=&nbsp;w. We have to
define it this way, as X() is usually not an injection.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The above
generic X() can be one of the following:</p>

functions.</p>

<h2>REALTIME CRITERION
<a name="REALTIME CRITERION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">RT criterion
<i>ignores class hierarchy</i> and guarantees precise
bandwidth and delay allocation. We say that a packet is
eligible for sending, when the current real time is later
than the eligible time of the packet. From all eligible
packets, the one most suited for sending is the one with the
shortest deadline time. This sounds simple, but consider the
following example:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Interface
10Mbit, two classes, both with two&minus;piece linear
service curves:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="17%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&bull;</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="77%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">1st class &minus; 2Mbit for
100ms, then 7Mbit (convex &minus; 1st slope &lt; 2nd
slope)</p> </td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="17%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>&bull;</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="77%">


<p>2nd class &minus; 7Mbit for 100ms, then 2Mbit (concave
&minus; 1st slope &gt; 2nd slope)</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Assume for a
moment, that we only use D() for both finding eligible
packets, and choosing the most fitting one, thus eligible
time would be computed as D^(&minus;1)(w) and deadline time
would be computed as D^(&minus;1)(w+l). If the 2nd class
starts sending packets 1 second after the 1st class,
it&rsquo;s of course impossible to guarantee 14Mbit, as the
interface capability is only 10Mbit. The only workaround in
this scenario is to allow the 1st class to send the packets
earlier that would normally be allowed. That&rsquo;s where
separate E() comes to help. Putting all the math aside (see
HFSC paper for details), E() for RT concave service curve is
just like D(), but for the RT convex service curve &minus;
it&rsquo;s constructed using <i>only</i> RT service
curve&rsquo;s 2nd slope (in our example <br>
7Mbit).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The effect of
such E() &minus; packets will be sent earlier, and at the
same time D() <i>will</i> be updated &minus; so the current
deadline time calculated from it will be later. Thus, when
the 2nd class starts sending packets later, both the 1st and
the 2nd class will be eligible, but the 2nd session&rsquo;s
deadline time will be smaller and its packets will be sent
first. When the 1st class becomes idle at some later point,
the 2nd class will be able to &quot;buffer&quot; up again
for later active period of the 1st class.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A short remark
&minus; in a situation, where the total amount of bandwidth
available on the interface is larger than the allocated
total realtime parts (imagine a 10 Mbit interface, but
1Mbit/2Mbit and 2Mbit/1Mbit classes), the sole speed of the
interface could suffice to guarantee the times.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Important part
of RT criterion is that apart from updating its D() and E(),
also V() used by LS criterion is updated. Generally the RT
criterion is secondary to LS one, and used <i>only</i> if
there&rsquo;s a risk of violating precise realtime
requirements. Still, the &quot;participation&quot; in
bandwidth distributed by LS criterion is there, so V() has
to be updated along the way. LS criterion can than properly
compensate for non&minus;ideal fair sharing situation,
caused by RT scheduling. If you use UL service curve its F()
will be updated as well (UL service curve is an extension to
LS one &minus; see <b>UPPERLIMIT CRITERION</b> section).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Anyway &minus;
careless specification of LS and RT service curves can lead
to potentially undesired situations (see CORNER CASES for
examples). This wasn&rsquo;t the case in HFSC paper where LS
and RT service curves couldn&rsquo;t be specified
separately.</p>

<h2>LINKSHARING CRITERION
<a name="LINKSHARING CRITERION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">LS
criterion&rsquo;s task is to distribute bandwidth according
to specified class hierarchy. Contrary to RT criterion,
there&rsquo;re no comparisons between current real time and
virtual time &minus; the decision is based solely on direct
comparison of virtual times of all active subclasses &minus;
the one with the smallest vt wins and gets scheduled. One
immediate conclusion from this fact is that absolute values
don&rsquo;t matter &minus; only ratios between them (so for
example, two children classes with simple linear 1Mbit
service curves will get the same treatment from LS
criterion&rsquo;s perspective, as if they were 5Mbit). The
other conclusion is, that in perfectly fluid system with
linear curves, all virtual times across whole class
hierarchy would be equal.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Why is VC
defined in term of virtual time (and what is it)?</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Imagine an
example: class A with two children &minus; A1 and A2, both
with let&rsquo;s say 10Mbit SCs. If A2 is idle, A1 receives
all the bandwidth of A (and update its V() in the process).
When A2 becomes active, A1&rsquo;s virtual time is already
<i>far</i> later than A2&rsquo;s one. Considering the type
of decision made by LS criterion, A1 would become idle for a
long time. We can workaround this situation by adjusting
virtual time of the class becoming active &minus; we do that
by getting such time &quot;up to date&quot;. HFSC uses a
mean of the smallest and the biggest virtual time of
currently active children fit for sending. As it&rsquo;s not
real time anymore (excluding trivial case of situation where
all classes become active at the same time, and never become
idle), it&rsquo;s called virtual time.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Such approach
has its price though. The problem is analogous to what was
presented in previous section and is caused by
non&minus;linearity of service curves:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">either it&rsquo;s impossible to

time periods:</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Recall the
example from RT section, slightly modified (with 3Mbit
slopes instead of 2Mbit ones):</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

</table>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">They sum up
nicely to 10Mbit &minus; the interface&rsquo;s capacity. But
if we wanted to only use LS for guarantees and fairness
&minus; it simply won&rsquo;t work. In LS context, only V()
is used for making decision which class to schedule. If the
2nd class becomes active when the 1st one is in its second
slope, the fairness will be preserved &minus; ratio will be
1:1 (7Mbit:7Mbit), but LS itself is of course unable to
guarantee the absolute values themselves &minus; as it would
have to go beyond of what the interface is capable of.</p>

guarantee service curves of all classes at the same time
[fairly or not]:</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This is similar
to the above case, but a bit more subtle. We will consider
two subtrees, arbitrated by their common (root here)
parent:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">R (root)
-&nbsp;10Mbit</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">A &minus;
7Mbit, then 3Mbit <br>
A1 &minus; 5Mbit, then 2Mbit <br>
A2 &minus; 2Mbit, then 1Mbit</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">B &minus;
3Mbit, then 7Mbit</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">R arbitrates
between left subtree (A) and right (B). Assume that A2 and B
are constantly backlogged, and at some later point A1
becomes backlogged (when all other classes are in their 2nd
linear part).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">What happens
now? B (choice made by R) will <i>always</i> get 7 Mbit as R
is only (obviously) concerned with the ratio between its
direct children. Thus A subtree gets 3Mbit, but its children
would want (at the point when A1 became backlogged) 5Mbit +
1Mbit. That&rsquo;s of course impossible, as they can only
get 3Mbit due to interface limitation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">In the left
subtree &minus; we have the same situation as previously
(fair split between A1 and A2, but violated guarantees), but
in the whole tree &minus; there&rsquo;s no fairness (B got
7Mbit, but A1 and A2 have to fit together in 3Mbit) and
there&rsquo;s no guarantees for all classes (only B got what
it wanted). Even if we violated fairness in the A subtree
and set A2&rsquo;s service curve to 0, A1 would still not
get the required bandwidth.</p>

<h2>UPPERLIMIT CRITERION
<a name="UPPERLIMIT CRITERION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">UL criterion is
an extensions to LS one, that permits sending packets only
if current real time is later than fit&minus;time
(&rsquo;ft&rsquo;). So the modified LS criterion becomes:
choose the smallest virtual time from all active children,
such that fit&minus;time &lt; current real time also holds.
Fit&minus;time is calculated from F(), which is based on UL
service curve. As you can see, its role is kinda similar to
E() used in RT criterion. Also, for obvious reasons &minus;
you can&rsquo;t specify UL service curve without LS one.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The main
purpose of the UL service curve is to limit HFSC to
bandwidth available on the upstream router (think adsl home
modem/router, and linux server as NAT/firewall/etc. with
100Mbit+ connection to mentioned modem/router). Typically,
it&rsquo;s used to create a single class directly under
root, setting a linear UL service curve to available
bandwidth &minus; and then creating your class structure
from that class downwards. Of course, you&rsquo;re free to
add a UL service curve (linear or not) to any class with LS
criterion.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">An important
part about the UL service curve is that whenever at some
point in time a class doesn&rsquo;t qualify for linksharing
due to its fit&minus;time, the next time it does qualify it
will update its virtual time to the smallest virtual time of
all active children fit for linksharing. This way, one of
the main things the LS criterion tries to achieve &minus;
equality of all virtual times across whole hierarchy &minus;
is preserved (in perfectly fluid system with only linear
curves, all virtual times would be equal).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Without that,
&rsquo;vt&rsquo; would lag behind other virtual times, and
could cause problems. Consider an interface with a capacity
of 10Mbit, and the following leaf classes (just in case
you&rsquo;re skipping this text quickly &minus; this example
shows behavior that <b><i>doesn&rsquo;t happen</i></b>):</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A &minus; ls
5.0Mbit <br>
B &minus; ls 2.5Mbit <br>
C &minus; ls 2.5Mbit, ul 2.5Mbit</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If B was idle,
while A and C were constantly backlogged, A and C would
normally (as far as LS criterion is concerned) divide
bandwidth in 2:1 ratio. But due to UL service curve in
place, C would get at most 2.5Mbit, and A would get the
remaining 7.5Mbit. The longer the backlogged period, the
more the virtual times of A and C would drift apart. If B
became backlogged at some later point in time, its virtual
time would be set to
(A&rsquo;s&nbsp;vt&nbsp;+&nbsp;C&rsquo;s&nbsp;vt)/2, thus
blocking A from sending any traffic until B&rsquo;s virtual
time catches up with A.</p>

<h2>SEPARATE LS / RT SCs
<a name="SEPARATE LS / RT SCs"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Another
difference from the original HFSC paper is that RT and LS
SCs can be specified separately. Moreover, leaf classes are
allowed to have only either RT SC or LS SC. For interior
classes, only LS SCs make sense: any RT SC will be
ignored.</p>

<h2>CORNER CASES
<a name="CORNER CASES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Separate
service curves for LS and RT criteria can lead to certain
traps that come from &quot;fighting&quot; between ideal
linksharing and enforced realtime guarantees. Those
situations didn&rsquo;t exist in original HFSC paper, where
specifying separate LS / RT service curves was not
discussed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Consider an
interface with a 10Mbit capacity, with the following leaf
classes:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A &minus; ls
5.0Mbit, rt 8Mbit <br>
B &minus; ls 2.5Mbit <br>
C &minus; ls 2.5Mbit</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Imagine A and C
are constantly backlogged. As B is idle, A and C would
divide bandwidth in 2:1 ratio, considering LS service curve
(so in theory &minus; 6.66 and 3.33). Alas RT criterion
takes priority, so A will get 8Mbit and LS will be able to
compensate class C for only 2 Mbit &minus; this will cause
discrepancy between virtual times of A and C.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Assume this
situation lasts for a long time with no idle periods, and
suddenly B becomes active. B&rsquo;s virtual time will be
updated to
(A&rsquo;s&nbsp;vt&nbsp;+&nbsp;C&rsquo;s&nbsp;vt)/2,
effectively landing in the middle between A&rsquo;s and
C&rsquo;s virtual time. The effect &minus; B, having no RT
guarantees, will be punished and will not be allowed to
transfer until C&rsquo;s virtual time catches up.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the
interface had a higher capacity, for example 100Mbit, this
example would behave perfectly fine though.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Let&rsquo;s
look a bit closer at the above example &minus; it
&quot;cleverly&quot; invalidates one of the basic things LS
criterion tries to achieve &minus; equality of all virtual
times across class hierarchy. Leaf classes without RT
service curves are literally left to their own fate
(governed by messed up virtual times).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Also, it
doesn&rsquo;t make much sense. Class A will always be
guaranteed up to 8Mbit, and this is more than any absolute
bandwidth that could happen from its LS criterion (excluding
trivial case of only A being active). If the bandwidth taken
by A is smaller than absolute value from LS criterion, the
unused part will be automatically assigned to other active
classes (as A has idling periods in such case). The only
&quot;advantage&quot; is, that even in case of low bandwidth
on average, bursts would be handled at the speed defined by
RT criterion. Still, if extra speed is needed (e.g. due to
latency), non linear service curves should be used in such
case.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In the other
words: the LS criterion is meaningless in the above
example.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can quickly
&quot;workaround&quot; it by making sure each leaf class has
RT service curve assigned (thus guaranteeing all of them
will get some bandwidth), but it doesn&rsquo;t make it any
more valid.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Keep in mind -
if you use nonlinear curves and irregularities explained
above happen <i>only</i> in the first segment, then
there&rsquo;s little wrong with &quot;overusing&quot; RT
curve a bit:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A &minus; ls
5.0Mbit, rt 9Mbit/30ms, then 1Mbit <br>
B &minus; ls 2.5Mbit <br>
C &minus; ls 2.5Mbit</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Here, the vt of
A will &quot;spike&quot; in the initial period, but then A
will never get more than 1Mbit until B &amp; C catch up.
Then everything will be back to normal.</p>

<h2>LINUX AND TIMER RESOLUTION
<a name="LINUX AND TIMER RESOLUTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In certain
situations, the scheduler can throttle itself and setup so
called watchdog to wakeup dequeue function at some time
later. In case of HFSC it happens when for example no packet
is eligible for scheduling, and UL service curve is used to
limit the speed at which LS criterion is allowed to dequeue
packets. It&rsquo;s called throttling, and accuracy of it is
dependent on how the kernel is compiled.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There&rsquo;re
3 important options in modern kernels, as far as
timers&rsquo; resolution goes: &rsquo;tickless
system&rsquo;, &rsquo;high resolution timer support&rsquo;
and &rsquo;timer frequency&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you have
&rsquo;tickless system&rsquo; enabled, then the timer
interrupt will trigger as slowly as possible, but each time
a scheduler throttles itself (or any other part of the
kernel needs better accuracy), the rate will be increased as
needed / possible. The ceiling is either &rsquo;timer
frequency&rsquo; if &rsquo;high resolution timer
support&rsquo; is not available or not compiled in, or
it&rsquo;s hardware dependent and can go <i>far</i> beyond
the highest &rsquo;timer frequency&rsquo; setting
available.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If
&rsquo;tickless system&rsquo; is not enabled, the timer will
trigger at a fixed rate specified by &rsquo;timer
frequency&rsquo; &minus; regardless if high resolution
timers are or aren&rsquo;t available.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This is
important to keep those settings in mind, as in scenario
like: no tickless, no HR timers, frequency set to 100hz
&minus; throttling accuracy would be at 10ms. It
doesn&rsquo;t automatically mean you would be limited to
~0.8Mbit/s (assuming packets at ~1KB) &minus; as long as
your queues are prepared to cover for timer inaccuracy. Of
course, in case of e.g. locally generated UDP traffic
&minus; appropriate socket size is needed as well. Short
example to make it more understandable (assume hardcore
anti&minus;schedule settings &minus; HZ=100, no HR timers,
no tickless):</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">tc qdisc add
dev eth0 root handle 1:0 hfsc default 1 <br>
tc class add dev eth0 parent 1:0 classid 1:1 hfsc rt m2
10Mbit</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Assuming packet
of ~1KB size and HZ=100, that averages to ~0.8Mbit &minus;
anything beyond it (e.g. the above example with specified
rate over 10x larger) will require appropriate queuing and
cause bursts every ~10 ms. As you can imagine, any
HFSC&rsquo;s RT guarantees will be seriously invalidated by
that. Aforementioned example is mainly important if you deal
with old hardware &minus; as is particularly popular for
home server chores. Even then, you can easily set HZ=1000
and have very accurate scheduling for typical adsl
speeds.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Anything modern
(apic or even hpet msi based timers + &rsquo;tickless
system&rsquo;) will provide enough accuracy for superb 1Gbit
scheduling. For example, on one of my cheap dual-core AMD
boards I have the following settings:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">tc qdisc add
dev eth0 parent root handle 1:0 hfsc default 1 <br>
tc class add dev eth0 parent 1:0 classid 1:1 hfsc rt m2
300mbit</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">And a
simple:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">nc &minus;u
dst.host.com 54321 &lt;/dev/zero <br>
nc &minus;l &minus;p 54321 &gt;/dev/null</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">...will yield
the following effects over a period of ~10 seconds (taken
from /proc/interrupts):</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">319: 42124229 0
HPET_MSI&minus;edge hpet2 (before) <br>
319: 42436214 0 HPET_MSI&minus;edge hpet2 (after 10s.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">That&rsquo;s
roughly 31000/s. Now compare it with HZ=1000 setting. The
obvious drawback of it is that cpu load can be rather high
with servicing that many timer interrupts. The example with
300Mbit RT service curve on 1Gbit link is particularly ugly,
as it requires a lot of throttling with minuscule
delays.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Also note that
it&rsquo;s just an example showing the capabilities of
current hardware. The above example (essentially a 300Mbit
TBF emulator) is pointless on an internal interface to begin
with: you will pretty much always want a regular LS service
curve there, and in such a scenario HFSC simply
doesn&rsquo;t throttle at all.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">300Mbit RT
service curve (selected columns from mpstat &minus;P ALL
1):</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">10:56:43 PM CPU
%sys %irq %soft %idle <br>
10:56:44 PM all 20.10 6.53 34.67 37.19 <br>
10:56:44 PM 0 35.00 0.00 63.00 0.00 <br>
10:56:44 PM 1 4.95 12.87 6.93 73.27</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">So, in the rare
case you need those speeds with only a RT service curve, or
with a UL service curve: remember the drawbacks.</p>

<h2>CAVEAT: RANDOM ONLINE EXAMPLES
<a name="CAVEAT: RANDOM ONLINE EXAMPLES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For reasons
unknown (though well guessed), many examples you can google
love to overuse UL criterion and stuff it in every node
possible. This makes no sense and works against what HFSC
tries to do (and does pretty damn well). Use UL where it
makes sense: on the uppermost node to match upstream
router&rsquo;s uplink capacity. Or in special cases, such as
testing (limit certain subtree to some speed), or customers
that must never get more than certain speed. In the last
case you can usually achieve the same by just using a RT
criterion without LS+UL on leaf nodes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As for the
router case - remember it&rsquo;s good to differentiate
between &quot;traffic to router&quot; (remote console, web
config, etc.) and &quot;outgoing traffic&quot;, so for
example:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">tc qdisc add
dev eth0 root handle 1:0 hfsc default 0x8002 <br>
tc class add dev eth0 parent 1:0 classid 1:999 hfsc rt m2
50Mbit <br>
tc class add dev eth0 parent 1:0 classid 1:1 hfsc ls m2
2Mbit ul m2 2Mbit</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">... so
&quot;internet&quot; tree under 1:1 and &quot;router
itself&quot; as 1:999</p>
