<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">console_codes
&minus; Linux console escape and control sequences</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The Linux
console implements a large subset of the VT102 and
ECMA-48/ISO 6429/ANSI X3.64 terminal controls, plus certain
private-mode sequences for changing the color palette,
character-set mapping, and so on. In the tabular
descriptions below, the second column gives ECMA-48 or DEC
mnemonics (the latter if prefixed with DEC) for the given
function. Sequences without a mnemonic are neither ECMA-48
nor VT102.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">After all the
normal output processing has been done, and a stream of
characters arrives at the console driver for actual
printing, the first thing that happens is a translation from
the code used for processing to the code used for
printing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the console
is in UTF-8 mode, then the incoming bytes are first
assembled into 16-bit Unicode codes. Otherwise each byte is
transformed according to the current mapping table (which
translates it to a Unicode value). See the <b>Character
Sets</b> section below for discussion.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In the normal
case, the Unicode value is converted to a font index, and
this is stored in video memory, so that the corresponding
glyph (as found in video ROM) appears on the screen. Note
that the use of Unicode (and the design of the PC hardware)
allows us to use 512 different glyphs simultaneously.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the current
Unicode value is a control character, or we are currently
processing an escape sequence, the value will treated
specially. Instead of being turned into a font index and
rendered as a glyph, it may trigger cursor movement or other
control functions. See the <b>Linux Console Controls</b>
section below for discussion.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is generally
not good practice to hard-wire terminal controls into
programs. Linux supports a <b>terminfo</b>(5) database of
terminal capabilities. Rather than emitting console escape
sequences by hand, you will almost always want to use a
terminfo-aware screen library or utility such as
<b>ncurses</b>(3), <b>tput</b>(1), or <b>reset</b>(1).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Linux
console controls</b> <br>
This section describes all the control characters and escape
sequences that invoke special functions (i.e., anything
other than writing a glyph at the current cursor location)
on the Linux console.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Control
characters</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A character is
a control character if (before transformation according to
the mapping table) it has one of the 14 codes 00 (NUL), 07
(BEL), 08 (BS), 09 (HT), 0a (LF), 0b (VT), 0c (FF), 0d (CR),
0e (SO), 0f (SI), 18 (CAN), 1a (SUB), 1b (ESC), 7f (DEL).
One can set a &quot;display control characters&quot; mode
(see below), and allow 07, 09, 0b, 18, 1a, 7f to be
displayed as glyphs. On the other hand, in UTF-8 mode all
codes 00-1f are regarded as control characters, regardless
of any &quot;display control characters&quot; mode.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If we have a
control character, it is acted upon immediately and then
discarded (even in the middle of an escape sequence) and the
escape sequence continues with the next character. (However,
ESC starts a new escape sequence, possibly aborting a
previous unfinished one, and CAN and SUB abort any escape
sequence.) The recognized control characters are BEL, BS,
HT, LF, VT, FF, CR, SO, SI, CAN, SUB, ESC, DEL, CSI. They do
what one would expect:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">CSI (or ESC [)
is followed by a sequence of parameters, at most NPAR (16),
that are decimal numbers separated by semicolons. An empty

parameters may be preceded by a single question mark.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">However, after
CSI [ (or ESC [ [) a single character is read and this
entire sequence is ignored. (The idea is to ignore an echoed

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Linux
Console Private CSI Sequences</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
sequences are neither ECMA-48 nor native VT102. They are
native to the Linux console driver. Colors are in SGR
parameters: 0 = black, 1 = red, 2 = green, 3 = brown, 4 =
blue, 5 = magenta, 6 = cyan, 7 = white.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Character
sets</b> <br>
The kernel knows about 4 translations of bytes into
console-screen symbols. The four tables are: a) Latin1
&minus;&gt; PC, b) VT100 graphics &minus;&gt; PC, c) PC
&minus;&gt; PC, d) user-defined.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There are two
character sets, called G0 and G1, and one of them is the
current character set. (Initially G0.) Typing <b>^N</b>
causes G1 to become current, <b>^O</b> causes G0 to become
current.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These variables
G0 and G1 point at a translation table, and can be changed
by the user. Initially they point at tables a) and b),
respectively. The sequences ESC ( B and ESC ( 0 and ESC ( U
and ESC ( K cause G0 to point at translation table a), b),
c) and d), respectively. The sequences ESC ) B and ESC ) 0
and ESC ) U and ESC ) K cause G1 to point at translation
table a), b), c) and d), respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The sequence
ESC c causes a terminal reset, which is what you want if the
screen is all garbled. The oft-advised &quot;echo ^V^O&quot;
will make only G0 current, but there is no guarantee that G0
points at table a). In some distributions there is a program
<b>reset</b>(1) that just does &quot;echo ^[c&quot;. If your
terminfo entry for the console is correct (and has an entry
rs1=\Ec), then &quot;tput reset&quot; will also work.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
user-defined mapping table can be set using
<b>mapscrn</b>(8). The result of the mapping is that if a
symbol c is printed, the symbol s = map[c] is sent to the
video memory. The bitmap that corresponds to s is found in
the character ROM, and can be changed using
<b>setfont</b>(8).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Mouse
tracking</b> <br>
The mouse tracking facility is intended to return
<b>xterm</b>(1)-compatible mouse status reports. Because the
console driver has no way to know the device or type of the
mouse, these reports are returned in the console input
stream only when the virtual terminal driver receives a
mouse update ioctl. These ioctls must be generated by a
mouse-aware user-mode application such as the <b>gpm</b>(8)
daemon.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The mouse
tracking escape sequences generated by <b>xterm</b>(1)
encode numeric parameters in a single character as
<i>value</i>+040. For example, '!' is 1. The screen
coordinate system is 1-based.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The X10
compatibility mode sends an escape sequence on button press
encoding the location and the mouse button pressed. It is
enabled by sending ESC [ ? 9 h and disabled with ESC [ ? 9
l. On button press, <b>xterm</b>(1) sends ESC [ M <i>bxy</i>
(6 characters). Here <i>b</i> is button&minus;1, and
<i>x</i> and <i>y</i> are the x and y coordinates of the
mouse when the button was pressed. This is the same code the
kernel also produces.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Normal tracking
mode (not implemented in Linux 2.0.24) sends an escape
sequence on both button press and release. Modifier
information is also sent. It is enabled by sending ESC [ ?
1000 h and disabled with ESC [ ? 1000 l. On button press or
release, <b>xterm</b>(1) sends ESC [ M <i>bxy</i>. The low
two bits of <i>b</i> encode button information: 0=MB1
pressed, 1=MB2 pressed, 2=MB3 pressed, 3=release. The upper
bits encode what modifiers were down when the button was
pressed and are added together: 4=Shift, 8=Meta, 16=Control.
Again <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> are the x and y coordinates of
the mouse event. The upper left corner is (1,1).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Comparisons
with other terminals</b> <br>
Many different terminal types are described, like the Linux
console, as being &quot;VT100-compatible&quot;. Here we
discuss differences between the Linux console and the two
most important others, the DEC VT102 and
<b>xterm</b>(1).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Control-character

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The VT102 also
recognized the following control characters:</p>

<p><b>Escape sequences</b></p></table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">VT100 console
sequences not implemented on the Linux console:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The program
<b>xterm</b>(1) (in VT100 mode) recognizes ESC c, ESC # 8,
ESC &gt;, ESC =, ESC D, ESC E, ESC H, ESC M, ESC N, ESC O,
ESC P ... ESC \, ESC Z (it answers ESC [ ? 1 ; 2 c, &quot;I
am a VT100 with advanced video option&quot;) and ESC ^ ...
ESC \ with the same meanings as indicated above. It accepts
ESC (, ESC ), ESC *, ESC + followed by 0, A, B for the DEC
special character and line drawing set, UK, and US-ASCII,
respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The user can
configure <b>xterm</b>(1) to respond to VT220-specific
control sequences, and it will identify itself as a VT52,
VT100, and up depending on the way it is configured and
initialized.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It accepts ESC
] (OSC) for the setting of certain resources. In addition to
the ECMA-48 string terminator (ST), <b>xterm</b>(1) accepts
a BEL to terminate an OSC string. These are a few of the OSC
control sequences recognized by <b>xterm</b>(1):</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It recognizes

Sequences</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Old versions of
<b>xterm</b>(1), for example, from X11R5, interpret the
blink SGR as a bold SGR. Later versions which implemented
ANSI colors, for example, XFree86 3.1.2A in 1995, improved
this by allowing the blink attribute to be displayed as a
color. Modern versions of xterm implement blink SGR as
blinking text and still allow colored text as an alternate
rendering of SGRs. Stock X11R6 versions did not recognize
the color-setting SGRs until the X11R6.8 release, which
incorporated XFree86 xterm. All ECMA-48 CSI sequences
recognized by Linux are also recognized by <i>xterm</i>,
however <b>xterm</b>(1) implements several ECMA-48 and DEC
control sequences not recognized by Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>xterm</b>(1) program recognizes all of the DEC Private
Mode sequences listed above, but none of the Linux
private-mode sequences. For discussion of
<b>xterm</b>(1)&rsquo;s own private-mode sequences, refer to
the <i>Xterm Control Sequences</i> document by Edward Moy,
Stephen Gildea, and Thomas E. Dickey available with the X

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">ESC 8 (DECRC)
is not able to restore the character set changed with ESC
%.</p>

<h2>BUGS
<a name="BUGS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In 2.0.23, CSI
is broken, and NUL is not ignored inside escape
sequences.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Some older
kernel versions (after 2.0) interpret 8-bit control
sequences. These &quot;C1 controls&quot; use codes between
128 and 159 to replace ESC [, ESC ] and similar two-byte
control sequence initiators. There are fragments of that in
modern kernels (either overlooked or broken by changes to
support UTF-8), but the implementation is incomplete and
should be regarded as unreliable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Linux
&quot;private mode&quot; sequences do not follow the rules
in ECMA-48 for private mode control sequences. In
particular, those ending with ] do not use a standard
terminating character. The OSC (set palette) sequence is a
greater problem, since <b>xterm</b>(1) may interpret this as
a control sequence which requires a string terminator (ST).
Unlike the <b>setterm</b>(1) sequences which will be ignored
(since they are invalid control sequences), the palette
sequence will make <b>xterm</b>(1) appear to hang (though
pressing the return-key will fix that). To accommodate
applications which have been hardcoded to use Linux control
sequences, set the <b>xterm</b>(1) resource
<b>brokenLinuxOSC</b> to true.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">An older
version of this document implied that Linux recognizes the
ECMA-48 control sequence for invisible text. It is
ignored.</p>
