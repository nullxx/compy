<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Pragma
<tt>&quot;use charnames&quot;</tt> is used to gain access to
the names of the Unicode characters and named character
sequences, and to allow you to define your own character and
character sequence names.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">All forms of
the pragma enable use of the following 3 functions:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>&bull;</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>&quot;charnames::string_vianame(<i>name</i>)&quot; for
run-time lookup of a either a character name or a named
character sequence, returning its string representation</p></td></tr>

<td width="1%">


<p>&bull;</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>&quot;charnames::vianame(<i>name</i>)&quot; for run-time

<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>&bull;</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>&quot;charnames::viacode(<i>code</i>)&quot; for run-time
lookup of a code point to get its Unicode name.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Starting in
Perl v5.16, any occurrence of
<tt>&quot;\N{</tt><i>CHARNAME</i><tt>}&quot;</tt> sequences
in a double-quotish string automatically loads this module
with arguments <tt>&quot;:full&quot;</tt> and
<tt>&quot;:short&quot;</tt> (described below) if it
hasn&rsquo;t already been loaded with different arguments,
in order to compile the named Unicode character into
position in the string. Prior to v5.16, an explicit
<tt>&quot;use&nbsp;charnames&quot;</tt> was required to
enable this usage. (However, prior to v5.16, the form
<tt>&quot;use&nbsp;charnames&nbsp;();&quot;</tt> did not
enable
<tt>&quot;\N{</tt><i>CHARNAME</i><tt>}&quot;</tt>.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
<tt>&quot;\N{U+</tt><i>...</i><tt>}&quot;</tt>, where the
<i>...</i> is a hexadecimal number, also inserts a character
into a string. The character it inserts is the one whose
code point (ordinal value) is equal to the number. For
example, <tt>&quot;\N{U+263a}&quot;</tt> is the Unicode
(white background, black foreground) smiley face equivalent
to <tt>&quot;\N{WHITE SMILING FACE}&quot;</tt>. Also note,
<tt>&quot;\N{</tt><i>...</i><tt>}&quot;</tt> can mean a
regex quantifier instead of a character name, when the
<i>...</i> is a number (or comma separated pair of numbers
(see &quot; <small>QUANTIFIERS</small> &quot; in perlreref),
and is not related to this pragma.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<tt>&quot;charnames&quot;</tt> pragma supports arguments
<tt>&quot;:full&quot;</tt>, <tt>&quot;:loose&quot;</tt>,
<tt>&quot;:short&quot;</tt>, script names and customized
aliases.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If
<tt>&quot;:full&quot;</tt> is present, for expansion of
<tt>&quot;\N{</tt><i>CHARNAME</i><tt>}&quot;</tt>, the
string <i><small>CHARNAME</small></i> is first looked up in
the list of standard Unicode character names.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><tt>&quot;:loose&quot;</tt>
is a variant of <tt>&quot;:full&quot;</tt> which allows
<i><small>CHARNAME</small></i> to be less precisely
specified. Details are in &quot; <small>LOOSE
MATCHES</small> &quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If
<tt>&quot;:short&quot;</tt> is present, and
<i><small>CHARNAME</small></i> has the form
<tt>&quot;</tt><i>SCRIPT</i><tt>:</tt><i>CNAME</i><tt>&quot;</tt>,
then <i><small>CNAME</small></i> is looked up as a letter in
script <i><small>SCRIPT</small></i> , as described in the
next paragraph. Or, if <tt>&quot;use charnames&quot;</tt> is
used with script name arguments, then for
<tt>&quot;\N{</tt><i>CHARNAME</i><tt>}&quot;</tt> the name
<i><small>CHARNAME</small></i> is looked up as a letter in
the given scripts (in the specified order). Customized
aliases can override these, and are explained in &quot;
<small>CUSTOM ALIASES</small> &quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For lookup of
<i><small>CHARNAME</small></i> inside a given script
<i><small>SCRIPTNAME</small></i> , this pragma looks in the
table of standard Unicode names for the names</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  SCRIPTNAME CAPITAL LETTER CHARNAME
  SCRIPTNAME SMALL LETTER CHARNAME
  SCRIPTNAME LETTER CHARNAME</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If
<i><small>CHARNAME</small></i> is all lowercase, then the
<tt>&quot;CAPITAL&quot;</tt> variant is ignored, otherwise
the <tt>&quot;SMALL&quot;</tt> variant is ignored, and both
<i><small>CHARNAME</small></i> and
<i><small>SCRIPTNAME</small></i> are converted to all
uppercase for look-up. Other than that, both of them follow
loose rules if <tt>&quot;:loose&quot;</tt> is also
specified; strict otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
<tt>&quot;\N{...}&quot;</tt> is compile-time; it&rsquo;s a
special form of string constant used inside double-quotish
strings; this means that you cannot use variables inside the
<tt>&quot;\N{...}&quot;</tt>. If you want similar run-time
functionality, use <i>charnames::string_vianame()</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Since Unicode
6.0, it is deprecated to use <tt>&quot;BELL&quot;</tt>.
Instead use <tt>&quot;ALERT&quot;</tt> (but
<tt>&quot;BEL&quot;</tt> will continue to work).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the input
name is unknown, <tt>&quot;\N{NAME}&quot;</tt> raises a
warning and substitutes the Unicode <small>REPLACEMENT
CHARACTER</small> (U+FFFD).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For
<tt>&quot;\N{NAME}&quot;</tt>, it is a fatal error if
<tt>&quot;use bytes&quot;</tt> is in effect and the input
name is that of a character that won&rsquo;t fit into a byte
(i.e., whose ordinal is above 255).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Otherwise, any
string that includes a
<tt>&quot;\N{</tt><i>charname</i><tt>}&quot;</tt> or
<tt>&quot;\N{U+</tt><i>code&nbsp;point</i><tt>}&quot;</tt>
will automatically have Unicode semantics (see &quot;Byte
and Character Semantics&quot; in perlunicode).</p>

<h2>LOOSE MATCHES
<a name="LOOSE MATCHES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">By specifying
<tt>&quot;:loose&quot;</tt>, Unicode&rsquo;s loose character
name matching
&lt;http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr44#Matching_Rules&gt;
rules are selected instead of the strict exact match used
otherwise. That means that <i><small>CHARNAME</small></i>
doesn&rsquo;t have to be so precisely specified. Upper/lower
case doesn&rsquo;t matter (except with scripts as mentioned
above), nor do any underscores, and the only hyphens that
matter are those at the beginning or end of a word in the
name (with one exception: the hyphen in U+1180
<tt>&quot;HANGUL JUNGSEONG O&minus;E&quot;</tt> does
matter). Also, blanks not adjacent to hyphens don&rsquo;t
matter. The official Unicode names are quite variable as to
where they use hyphens versus spaces to separate word-like
units, and this option allows you to not have to care as
much. The reason non-medial hyphens matter is because of
cases like U+0F60 <tt>&quot;TIBETAN LETTER
&minus;A&quot;</tt> versus U+0F68 <tt>&quot;TIBETAN LETTER
A&quot;</tt>. The hyphen here is significant, as is the
space before it, and so both must be included.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><tt>&quot;:loose&quot;</tt>
slows down look-ups by a factor of 2 to 3 versus
<tt>&quot;:full&quot;</tt>, but the trade-off may be worth
it to you. Each individual look-up takes very little time,
and the results are cached, so the speed difference would
become a factor only in programs that do look-ups of many
different spellings, and probably only when those look-ups
are through <i>vianame()</i> and <i>string_vianame()</i>,
since <tt>&quot;\N{...}&quot;</tt> look-ups are done at
compile time.</p>

<h2>ALIASES
<a name="ALIASES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Starting in
Unicode 6.1 and Perl v5.16, Unicode defines many
abbreviations and names that were formerly Perl extensions,
and some additional ones that Perl did not previously
accept. The list is getting too long to reproduce here, but
you can get the complete list from the Unicode web site:
&lt;http://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/NameAliases.txt&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Earlier
versions of Perl accepted almost all the 6.1 names. These
were most extensively documented in the v5.14 version of
this pod:
&lt;http://perldoc.perl.org/5.14.0/charnames.html#ALIASES&gt;.</p>

<h2>CUSTOM ALIASES
<a name="CUSTOM ALIASES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can add
customized aliases to standard (<tt>&quot;:full&quot;</tt>)
Unicode naming conventions. The aliases override any
standard definitions, so, if you&rsquo;re twisted enough,
you can change <tt>&quot;\N{LATIN CAPITAL LETTER
A}&quot;</tt> to mean <tt>&quot;B&quot;</tt>, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that an
alias should not be something that is a legal curly
brace-enclosed quantifier (see &quot;
<small>QUANTIFIERS</small> &quot; in perlreref). For example
<tt>&quot;\N{123}&quot;</tt> means to match 123 non-newline
characters, and is not treated as a charnames alias. Aliases
are discouraged from beginning with anything other than an
alphabetic character and from containing anything other than
alphanumerics, spaces, dashes, parentheses, and underscores.
Currently they must be <small>ASCII</small> .</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">An alias can
map to either an official Unicode character name (not a
loose matched name) or to a numeric code point (ordinal).
The latter is useful for assigning names to code points in
Unicode private use areas such as U+E800 through U+F8FF. A
numeric code point must be a non-negative integer or a
string beginning with <tt>&quot;U+&quot;</tt> or
<tt>&quot;0x&quot;</tt> with the remainder considered to be
a hexadecimal integer. A literal numeric constant must be
unsigned; it will be interpreted as hex if it has a leading
zero or contains non-decimal hex digits; otherwise it will
be interpreted as decimal.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Aliases are
added either by the use of anonymous hashes:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    use charnames &quot;:alias&quot; =&gt; {
        e_ACUTE =&gt; &quot;LATIN SMALL LETTER E WITH ACUTE&quot;,
        mychar1 =&gt; 0xE8000,
        };
    my $str = &quot;\N{e_ACUTE}&quot;;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">or by using a
file containing aliases:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    use charnames &quot;:alias&quot; =&gt; &quot;pro&quot;;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This will try
to read <tt>&quot;unicore/pro_alias.pl&quot;</tt> from the
<tt>@INC</tt> path. This file should return a list in plain
perl:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    (
    A_GRAVE         =&gt; &quot;LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH GRAVE&quot;,
    A_CIRCUM        =&gt; &quot;LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH CIRCUMFLEX&quot;,
    A_DIAERES       =&gt; &quot;LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH DIAERESIS&quot;,
    A_TILDE         =&gt; &quot;LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH TILDE&quot;,
    A_BREVE         =&gt; &quot;LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH BREVE&quot;,
    A_RING          =&gt; &quot;LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH RING ABOVE&quot;,
    A_MACRON        =&gt; &quot;LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH MACRON&quot;,
    mychar2         =&gt; &quot;U+E8001&quot;,
    );</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Both these
methods insert <tt>&quot;:full&quot;</tt> automatically as
the first argument (if no other argument is given), and you
can give the <tt>&quot;:full&quot;</tt> explicitly as well,
like</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    use charnames &quot;:full&quot;, &quot;:alias&quot; =&gt; &quot;pro&quot;;</pre>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;:loose&quot;
has no effect with these. Input names must match exactly,
using <tt>&quot;:full&quot;</tt> rules.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Also, both
these methods currently allow only single characters to be
named. To name a sequence of characters, use a custom
translator (described below).</p>

<h2>charnames::string_vianame(name)
<a name="charnames::string_vianame(name)"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This is a
runtime equivalent to <tt>&quot;\N{...}&quot;</tt>.
<i>name</i> can be any expression that evaluates to a name
accepted by <tt>&quot;\N{...}&quot;</tt> under the
<tt>&quot;:full&quot;</tt> option to
<tt>&quot;charnames&quot;</tt>. In addition, any other
options for the controlling <tt>&quot;use
charnames&quot;</tt> in the same scope apply, like
<tt>&quot;:loose&quot;</tt> or any script list,
<tt>&quot;:short&quot;</tt> option, or custom aliases you
may have defined.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The only
difference is that if the input name is unknown,
<tt>&quot;string_vianame&quot;</tt> returns
<tt>&quot;undef&quot;</tt> instead of the <small>REPLACEMENT
CHARACTER</small> and does not raise a warning message.</p>

<h2>charnames::vianame(name)
<a name="charnames::vianame(name)"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This is similar
to <tt>&quot;string_vianame&quot;</tt>. The main difference
is that under most circumstances, vianame returns an ordinal
code point, whereas <tt>&quot;string_vianame&quot;</tt>
returns a string. For example,</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">   printf &quot;U+%04X&quot;, charnames::vianame(&quot;FOUR TEARDROP&minus;SPOKED ASTERISK&quot;);</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">prints
&quot;U+2722&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This leads to
the other two differences. Since a single code point is
returned, the function can&rsquo;t handle named character
sequences, as these are composed of multiple characters (it
returns <tt>&quot;undef&quot;</tt> for these. And, the code
point can be that of any character, even ones that
aren&rsquo;t legal under the
<tt>&quot;use&nbsp;bytes&quot;</tt> pragma,</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">See &quot;
<small>BUGS</small> &quot; for the circumstances in which
the behavior differs from that described above.</p>

<h2>charnames::viacode(code)
<a name="charnames::viacode(code)"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Returns the
full name of the character indicated by the numeric code.
For example,</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    print charnames::viacode(0x2722);</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">prints &quot;
<small>FOUR</small> TEARDROP-SPOKED <small>ASTERISK</small>
&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The name
returned is the &quot;best&quot; (defined below) official
name or alias for the code point, if available; otherwise
your custom alias for it, if defined; otherwise
<tt>&quot;undef&quot;</tt>. This means that your alias will
only be returned for code points that don&rsquo;t have an
official Unicode name (nor alias) such as private use code
points.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you define
more than one name for the code point, it is indeterminate
which one will be returned.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As mentioned,
the function returns <tt>&quot;undef&quot;</tt> if no name
is known for the code point. In Unicode the proper name of
these is the empty string, which <tt>&quot;undef&quot;</tt>
stringifies to. (If you ask for a code point past the legal
Unicode maximum of U+10FFFF that you haven&rsquo;t assigned
an alias to, you get <tt>&quot;undef&quot;</tt> plus a
warning.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The input
number must be a non-negative integer, or a string beginning
with <tt>&quot;U+&quot;</tt> or <tt>&quot;0x&quot;</tt> with
the remainder considered to be a hexadecimal integer. A
literal numeric constant must be unsigned; it will be
interpreted as hex if it has a leading zero or contains
non-decimal hex digits; otherwise it will be interpreted as
decimal.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As mentioned
above under &quot; <small>ALIASES</small> &quot;, Unicode
6.1 defines extra names (synonyms or aliases) for some code
points, most of which were already available as Perl
extensions. All these are accepted by
<tt>&quot;\N{...}&quot;</tt> and the other functions in this
module, but <tt>&quot;viacode&quot;</tt> has to choose which
one name to return for a given input code point, so it
returns the &quot;best&quot; name. To understand how this
works, it is helpful to know more about the Unicode name
properties. All code points actually have only a single
name, which (starting in Unicode 2.0) can never change once
a character has been assigned to the code point. But
mistakes have been made in assigning names, for example
sometimes a clerical error was made during the publishing of
the Standard which caused words to be misspelled, and there
was no way to correct those. The Name_Alias property was
eventually created to handle these situations. If a name was
wrong, a corrected synonym would be published for it, using
Name_Alias. <tt>&quot;viacode&quot;</tt> will return that
corrected synonym as the &quot;best&quot; name for a code
point. (It is even possible, though it hasn&rsquo;t happened
yet, that the correction itself will need to be corrected,
and so another Name_Alias can be created for that code
point; <tt>&quot;viacode&quot;</tt> will return the most
recent correction.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The Unicode
name for each of the control characters (such as <small>LINE
FEED</small> ) is the empty string. However almost all had
names assigned by other standards, such as the
<small>ASCII</small> Standard, or were in common use.
<tt>&quot;viacode&quot;</tt> returns these names as the
&quot;best&quot; ones available. Unicode 6.1 has created
Name_Aliases for each of them, including alternate names,
like <small>NEW LINE</small> . <tt>&quot;viacode&quot;</tt>
uses the original name, &quot; <small>LINE FEED</small>
&quot; in preference to the alternate. Similarly the name
returned for U+FEFF is &quot; <small>ZERO WIDTH</small>
NO-BREAK <small>SPACE</small> &quot;, not &quot; <small>BYTE
ORDER MARK</small> &quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Until Unicode
6.1, the 4 control characters U+0080, U+0081, U+0084, and
U+0099 did not have names nor aliases. To preserve backwards
compatibility, any alias you define for these code points
will be returned by this function, in preference to the
official name.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Some code
points also have abbreviated names, such as &quot;
<small>LF</small> &quot; or &quot; <small>NL</small> &quot;.
<tt>&quot;viacode&quot;</tt> never returns these.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Because a name
correction may be added in future Unicode releases, the name
that <tt>&quot;viacode&quot;</tt> returns may change as a
result. This is a rare event, but it does happen.</p>

<h2>CUSTOM TRANSLATORS
<a name="CUSTOM TRANSLATORS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The mechanism
of translation of <tt>&quot;\N{...}&quot;</tt> escapes is
general and not hardwired into <i>charnames.pm</i>. A module
can install custom translations (inside the scope which
<tt>&quot;use&quot;</tt>s the module) with the following
magic incantation:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    sub import {
        shift;
        $^H{charnames} = \&amp;translator;
    }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Here
<i>translator()</i> is a subroutine which takes

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Since the text
to insert should be different in <tt>&quot;bytes&quot;</tt>
mode and out of it, the function should check the current

<h2>BUGS
<a name="BUGS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>vianame()</i>
normally returns an ordinal code point, but when the input
name is of the form <tt>&quot;U+...&quot;</tt>, it returns a
chr instead. In this case, if <tt>&quot;use bytes&quot;</tt>
is in effect and the character won&rsquo;t fit into a byte,
it returns <tt>&quot;undef&quot;</tt> and raises a
warning.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Names must be
<small>ASCII</small> characters only, which means that you
are out of luck if you want to create aliases in a language
where some or all the characters of the desired aliases are
non-ASCII.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Since
evaluation of the translation function (see &quot;
<small>CUSTOM TRANSLATORS</small> &quot;) happens in the
middle of compilation (of a string literal), the translation
function should not do any <tt>&quot;eval&quot;</tt>s or
<tt>&quot;require&quot;</tt>s. This restriction should be
lifted (but is low priority) in a future version of
Perl.</p>
