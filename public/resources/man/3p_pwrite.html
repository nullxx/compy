<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>write</i>() function shall attempt to write <i>nbyte</i>
bytes from the buffer pointed to by <i>buf</i> to the file
associated with the open file descriptor, <i>fildes</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Before any
action described below is taken, and if <i>nbyte</i> is zero
and the file is a regular file, the <i>write</i>() function
may detect and return errors as described below. In the
absence of errors, or if error detection is not performed,
the <i>write</i>() function shall return zero and have no
other results. If <i>nbyte</i> is zero and the file is not a
regular file, the results are unspecified.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On a regular
file or other file capable of seeking, the actual writing of
data shall proceed from the position in the file indicated
by the file offset associated with <i>fildes</i>. Before
successful return from <i>write</i>(), the file offset shall
be incremented by the number of bytes actually written. On a
regular file, if this incremented file offset is greater
than the length of the file, the length of the file shall be
set to this file offset.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On a file not
capable of seeking, writing shall always take place starting
at the current position. The value of a file offset
associated with such a device is undefined.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the O_APPEND
flag of the file status flags is set, the file offset shall
be set to the end of the file prior to each write and no
intervening file modification operation shall occur between
changing the file offset and the write operation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If a
<i>write</i>() requests that more bytes be written than
there is room for (for example, the process&rsquo; file size
limit or the physical end of a medium), only as many bytes
as there is room for shall be written. For example, suppose
there is space for 20 bytes more in a file before reaching a
limit. A write of 512 bytes will return 20. The next write
of a non-zero number of bytes would give a failure return
(except as noted below).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the request
would cause the file size to exceed the soft file size limit
for the process and there is no room for any bytes to be
written, the request shall fail and the implementation shall
generate the SIGXFSZ signal for the thread.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If
<i>write</i>() is interrupted by a signal before it writes
any data, it shall return -1 with <i>errno</i> set to
[EINTR].</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If
<i>write</i>() is interrupted by a signal after it
successfully writes some data, it shall return the number of
bytes written.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the value of
<i>nbyte</i> is greater than {SSIZE_MAX}, the result is
implementation-defined.</p>

<i>write</i>() to a regular file has successfully

packet size value is 0, <i>write</i>() shall break the
buffer into maximum packet size segments prior to sending

Writing a zero-length buffer ( <i>nbyte</i> is 0) to a

maximum is called {PIPE_BUF}. This volume of

can be written in one operation without blocking) may vary

happen (with <i>nbyte</i>&gt; {PIPE_BUF}), this volume of
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 does not guarantee atomicity,
even if <i>ret</i>&lt;= {PIPE_BUF}, because atomicity is
guaranteed according to the amount <i>requested</i>, not the
amount <i>written</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Deferred:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><i>ret</i>=-1,

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">This error
indicates that a later request may succeed. It does not
indicate that it <i>shall</i> succeed, even if
<i>nbyte</i>&lt;= {PIPE_BUF}, because if no process reads
from the pipe or FIFO, the write never succeeds. An
application could usefully count the number of times
[EAGAIN] is caused by a particular value of <i>nbyte</i>&gt;
{PIPE_BUF} and perhaps do later writes with a smaller value,
on the assumption that the effective size of the pipe may
have decreased.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Partial and
deferred writes are only possible with O_NONBLOCK set.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The relations
of these properties are shown in the following tables:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the
O_NONBLOCK flag is clear, a write request shall block if the
amount writable immediately is less than that requested. If
the flag is set (by <i>fcntl</i>()), a write request shall
never block.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&nbsp;
&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There is no
exception regarding partial writes when O_NONBLOCK is set.
With the exception of writing to an empty pipe, this volume
of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 does not specify exactly
when a partial write is performed since that would require
specifying internal details of the implementation. Every
application should be prepared to handle partial writes when
O_NONBLOCK is set and the requested amount is greater than
{PIPE_BUF}, just as every application should be prepared to
handle partial writes on other kinds of file
descriptors.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The intent of
forcing writing at least one byte if any can be written is
to assure that each write makes progress if there is any
room in the pipe. If the pipe is empty, {PIPE_BUF} bytes
must be written; if not, at least some progress must have
been made.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Where this
volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires -1 to be
returned and <i>errno</i> set to [EAGAIN], most historical
implementations return zero (with the O_NDELAY flag set,
which is the historical predecessor of O_NONBLOCK, but is
not itself in this volume of
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001). The error indications in
this volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 were chosen so
that an application can distinguish these cases from
end-of-file. While <i>write</i>() cannot receive an
indication of end-of-file, <i>read</i>() can, and the two
functions have similar return values. Also, some existing
systems (for example, Eighth Edition) permit a write of zero
bytes to mean that the reader should get an end-of-file
indication; for those systems, a return value of zero from
<i>write</i>() indicates a successful write of an
end-of-file indication.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Implementations
are allowed, but not required, to perform error checking for
<i>write</i>() requests of zero bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The concept of
a {PIPE_MAX} limit (indicating the maximum number of bytes
that can be written to a pipe in a single operation) was
considered, but rejected, because this concept would
unnecessarily limit application writing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">See also the
discussion of O_NONBLOCK in <i>read</i>().</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Writes can be
serialized with respect to other reads and writes. If a
<i>read</i>() of file data can be proven (by any means) to
occur after a <i>write</i>() of the data, it must reflect
that <i>write</i>(), even if the calls are made by different
processes. A similar requirement applies to multiple write
operations to the same file position. This is needed to
guarantee the propagation of data from <i>write</i>() calls
to subsequent <i>read</i>() calls. This requirement is
particularly significant for networked file systems, where
some caching schemes violate these semantics.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that this
is specified in terms of <i>read</i>() and <i>write</i>().
The XSI extensions <i>readv</i>() and <i>writev</i>() also
obey these semantics. A new &quot;high-performance&quot;
write analog that did not follow these serialization
requirements would also be permitted by this wording. This
volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 is also silent
about any effects of application-level caching (such as that
done by <i>stdio</i>).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This volume of
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 does not specify the value of
the file offset after an error is returned; there are too
many cases. For programming errors, such as [EBADF], the
concept is meaningless since no file is involved. For errors
that are detected immediately, such as [EAGAIN], clearly the
pointer should not change. After an interrupt or hardware
error, however, an updated value would be very useful and is
the behavior of many implementations.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This volume of
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 does not specify behavior of
concurrent writes to a file from multiple processes.
Applications should use some form of concurrency
control.</p>
