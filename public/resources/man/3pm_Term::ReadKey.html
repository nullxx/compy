<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Term::ReadKey
is a compiled perl module dedicated to providing simple
control over terminal driver modes (cbreak, raw, cooked,
etc.,) support for non-blocking reads, if the architecture
allows, and some generalized handy functions for working
with terminals. One of the main goals is to have the
functions as portable as possible, so you can just plug in
&quot;use Term::ReadKey&quot; on any architecture and have a
good likelyhood of it working. <br>
ReadMode <small>MODE</small> [, Filehandle]</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">Takes an integer argument,
which can currently be one of the following values:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">    0    Restore original settings.
    1    Change to cooked mode.
    2    Change to cooked mode with echo off.
          (Good for passwords)
    3    Change to cbreak mode.
    4    Change to raw mode.
    5    Change to ultra&minus;raw mode.
          (LF to CR/LF translation turned off)
    Or, you may use the synonyms:
    restore
    normal
    noecho
    cbreak
    raw
    ultra&minus;raw</pre>


<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">These functions
are automatically applied to the <small>STDIN</small> handle
if no other handle is supplied. Modes 0 and 5 have some
special properties worth mentioning: not only will mode 0
restore original settings, but it cause the next ReadMode
call to save a new set of default settings. Mode 5 is
similar to mode 4, except no <small>CR/LF</small>
translation is performed, and if possible, parity will be
disabled (only if not being used by the terminal, however.
It is no different from mode 4 under Windows.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">If you are
executing another program that may be changing the terminal
mode, you will either want to say</p>

<pre style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">    ReadMode 1
    system('someprogram');
    ReadMode 1;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">which resets
the settings after the program has run, or:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">    $somemode=1;
    ReadMode 0;
    system('someprogram');
    ReadMode 1;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">which records
any changes the program may have made, before resetting the
mode.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">ReadKey <small>MODE</small> [,
Filehandle]</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">Takes an integer argument,
which can currently be one of the following values:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">    0    Perform a normal read using getc
    &minus;1   Perform a non&minus;blocked read
    &gt;0   Perform a timed read</pre>


<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">(If the
filehandle is not supplied, it will default to
<small>STDIN.</small> ) If there is nothing waiting in the
buffer during a non-blocked read, then undef will be
returned. Note that if the <small>OS</small> does not
provide any known mechanism for non-blocking reads, then a
<tt>&quot;ReadKey &minus;1&quot;</tt> can die with a fatal
error. This will hopefully not be common.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">If
<small>MODE</small> is greater then zero, then ReadKey will
use it as a timeout value in seconds (fractional seconds are
allowed), and won&rsquo;t return <tt>&quot;undef&quot;</tt>
until that time expires. (Note, again, that some
<small>OS</small> &rsquo;s may not support this timeout
behaviour.) If <small>MODE</small> is less then zero, then
this is treated as a timeout of zero, and thus will return
immediately if no character is waiting. A
<small>MODE</small> of zero, however, will act like a normal
getc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">There are
currently some limitations with this call under Windows. It
may be possible that non-blocking reads will fail when
reading repeating keys from more then one console.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">ReadLine <small>MODE</small> [,
Filehandle]</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">Takes an integer argument,
which can currently be one of the following values:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">    0    Perform a normal read using scalar(&lt;FileHandle&gt;)
    &minus;1   Perform a non&minus;blocked read
    &gt;0   Perform a timed read</pre>


<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">If there is
nothing waiting in the buffer during a non-blocked read,
then undef will be returned. Note that if the
<small>OS</small> does not provide any known mechanism for
non-blocking reads, then a <tt>&quot;ReadLine 1&quot;</tt>
can die with a fatal error. This will hopefully not be
common. Note that a non-blocking test is only performed for
the first character in the line, not the entire line. This
call will probably <b>not</b> do what you assume, especially
with ReadMode&rsquo;s higher then 1. For example, pressing
Space and then Backspace would appear to leave you where you
started, but any timeouts would now be suspended.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">This call is
currently not available under Windows.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">GetTerminalSize
[Filehandle]</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">Returns either an empty array
if this operation is unsupported, or a four element array
containing: the width of the terminal in characters, the
height of the terminal in character, the width in pixels,
and the height in pixels. (The pixel size will only be valid
in some environments.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">Under Windows,
this function must be called with an &quot;output&quot;
filehandle, such as <small>STDOUT,</small> or a handle
opened to <small>CONOUT$.</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">SetTerminalSize
<small>WIDTH,HEIGHT,XPIX,YPIX</small> [, Filehandle]</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">Return &minus;1 on failure, 0
otherwise. Note that this terminal size is only for
<b>informative</b> value, and changing the size via this
mechanism will <b>not</b> change the size of the screen. For
example, XTerm uses a call like this when it resizes the
screen. If any of the new measurements vary from the old,
the <small>OS</small> will probably send a
<small>SIGWINCH</small> signal to anything reading that tty
or pty.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">This call does
not work under Windows.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">GetSpeeds [, Filehandle]</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">Returns either an empty array
if the operation is unsupported, or a two value array
containing the terminal in and out speeds, in
<b>decimal</b>. E.g, an in speed of 9600 baud and an out
speed of 4800 baud would be returned as (9600,4800). Note
that currently the in and out speeds will always be
identical in some <small>OS</small> &rsquo;s. No speeds are
reported under Windows.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">GetControlChars [,
Filehandle]</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">Returns an array containing
key/value pairs suitable for a hash. The pairs consist of a
key, the name of the control character/signal, and the value
of that character, as a single character. This call does
nothing under Windows.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">Each key will
be an entry from the following list:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">        DISCARD
        DSUSPEND
        EOF
        EOL
        EOL2
        ERASE
        ERASEWORD
        INTERRUPT
        KILL
        MIN
        QUIT
        QUOTENEXT
        REPRINT
        START
        STATUS
        STOP
        SUSPEND
        SWITCH
        TIME</pre>


<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">Thus, the
following will always return the current interrupt
character, regardless of platform.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">        %keys = GetControlChars;
        $int = $keys{INTERRUPT};</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%;">SetControlChars [,
Filehandle]</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">Takes an array containing
key/value pairs, as a hash will produce. The pairs should
consist of a key that is the name of a legal control
character/signal, and the value should be either a single
character, or a number in the range 0&minus;255.
SetControlChars will die with a runtime error if an invalid
character name is passed or there is an error changing the
settings. The list of valid names is easily available
via</p>

<pre style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">        %cchars = GetControlChars();
        @cnames = keys %cchars;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">This call does
nothing under Windows.</p>
