</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">bind &minus;
Arrange for X events to invoke Tcl scripts</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>bind</b>
<i>tag</i> ?<i>sequence</i>? ?<b>+</b>??<i>script</i>?
_________________________________________________________________</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION
<a name="INTRODUCTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The <b>bind</b>
command associates Tcl scripts with X events. If all three
arguments are specified, <b>bind</b> will arrange for
<i>script</i> (a Tcl script) to be evaluated whenever the
event(s) given by <i>sequence</i> occur in the window(s)
identified by <i>tag</i>. If <i>script</i> is prefixed with
a &ldquo;+&rdquo;, then it is appended to any existing
binding for <i>sequence</i>; otherwise <i>script</i>
replaces any existing binding. If <i>script</i> is an empty
string then the current binding for <i>sequence</i> is
destroyed, leaving <i>sequence</i> unbound. In all of the
cases where a <i>script</i> argument is provided,
<b>bind</b> returns an empty string.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If
<i>sequence</i> is specified without a <i>script</i>, then
the script currently bound to <i>sequence</i> is returned,
or an empty string is returned if there is no binding for
<i>sequence</i>. If neither <i>sequence</i> nor
<i>script</i> is specified, then the return value is a list
whose elements are all the sequences for which there exist
bindings for <i>tag</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The <i>tag</i>
argument determines which window(s) the binding applies to.
If <i>tag</i> begins with a dot, as in <b>.a.b.c</b>, then
it must be the path name for a window; otherwise it may be
an arbitrary string. Each window has an associated list of
tags, and a binding applies to a particular window if its
tag is among those specified for the window. Although the
<b>bindtags</b> command may be used to assign an arbitrary
set of binding tags to a window, the default binding tags
provide the following behavior:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>&bull;</p></td>
<td width="3%"></td>
<td width="85%">


<p>If a tag is the name of an internal window the binding
applies to that window.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>&bull;</p></td>
<td width="3%"></td>
<td width="85%">


<p>If the tag is the name of a toplevel window the binding
applies to the toplevel window and all its internal
windows.</p> </td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>&bull;</p></td>
<td width="3%"></td>
<td width="85%">


<p>If the tag is the name of a class of widgets, such as
<b>Button</b>, the binding applies to all widgets in that
class;</p> </td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>&bull;</p></td>
<td width="3%"></td>
<td width="85%">


<p>If <i>tag</i> has the value <b>all</b>, the binding
applies to all windows in the application.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<h2>EVENT PATTERNS
<a name="EVENT PATTERNS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>sequence</i> argument specifies a sequence of one or more
event patterns, with optional white space between the
patterns. Each event pattern may take one of three forms. In
the simplest case it is a single printing ASCII character,
such as <b>a</b> or <b>[</b>. The character may not be a
space character or the character <b>&lt;</b>. This form of
pattern matches a <b>KeyPress</b> event for the particular
character. The second form of pattern is longer but more
general. It has the following syntax:</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>&lt;</b><i>modifier&minus;modifier&minus;type&minus;detail</i><b>&gt;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">The entire event pattern is
surrounded by angle brackets. Inside the angle brackets are
zero or more modifiers, an event type, and an extra piece of
information (<i>detail</i>) identifying a particular button
or keysym. Any of the fields may be omitted, as long as at
least one of <i>type</i> and <i>detail</i> is present. The
fields must be separated by white space or dashes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The third form
of pattern is used to specify a user-defined, named virtual
event. It has the following syntax:</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>&lt;&lt;</b><i>name</i><b>&gt;&gt;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">The entire virtual event
pattern is surrounded by double angle brackets. Inside the
angle brackets is the user-defined name of the virtual
event. Modifiers, such as <b>Shift</b> or <b>Control</b>,
may not be combined with a virtual event to modify it.
Bindings on a virtual event may be created before the
virtual event is defined, and if the definition of a virtual
event changes dynamically, all windows bound to that virtual
event will respond immediately to the new definition.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Some widgets
(e.g. <b>menu</b> and <b>text</b>) issue virtual events when
their internal state is updated in some ways. Please see the
manual page for each widget for details.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>MODIFIERS</b>
<br>
Modifiers consist of any of the following values: <b>Control
Mod1</b>, <b>M1</b>, <b>Command Alt Mod2</b>, <b>M2</b>,
<b>Option Shift Mod3</b>, <b>M3 Lock Mod4</b>, <b>M4
Extended Mod5</b>, <b>M5 Button1</b>, <b>B1 Meta</b>, <b>M
Button2</b>, <b>B2 Double Button3</b>, <b>B3 Triple
Button4</b>, <b>B4 Quadruple Button5</b>, <b>B5</b> Where
more than one value is listed, separated by commas, the
values are equivalent. Most of the modifiers have the
obvious X meanings. For example, <b>Button1</b> requires
that button 1 be depressed when the event occurs. For a
binding to match a given event, the modifiers in the event
must include all of those specified in the event pattern. An
event may also contain additional modifiers not specified in
the binding. For example, if button 1 is pressed while the
shift and control keys are down, the pattern
<b>&lt;Control&minus;Button&minus;1&gt;</b> will match the
event, but <b>&lt;Mod1&minus;Button&minus;1&gt;</b> will
not. If no modifiers are specified, then any combination of
modifiers may be present in the event.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Meta</b> and
<b>M</b> refer to whichever of the <b>M1</b> through
<b>M5</b> modifiers is associated with the Meta key(s) on
the keyboard (keysyms <b>Meta_R</b> and <b>Meta_L</b>). If
there are no Meta keys, or if they are not associated with
any modifiers, then <b>Meta</b> and <b>M</b> will not match
any events. Similarly, the <b>Alt</b> modifier refers to
whichever modifier is associated with the alt key(s) on the
keyboard (keysyms <b>Alt_L</b> and <b>Alt_R</b>).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>Double</b>, <b>Triple</b> and <b>Quadruple</b> modifiers
are a convenience for specifying double mouse clicks and
other repeated events. They cause a particular event pattern
to be repeated 2, 3 or 4 times, and also place a time and
space requirement on the sequence: for a sequence of events
to match a <b>Double</b>, <b>Triple</b> or <b>Quadruple</b>
pattern, all of the events must occur close together in time
and without substantial mouse motion in between. For
example, <b>&lt;Double&minus;Button&minus;1&gt;</b> is
equivalent to
<b>&lt;Button&minus;1&gt;&lt;Button&minus;1&gt;</b> with the
extra time and space requirement.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>Command</b> and <b>Option</b> modifiers are equivalents
of <b>Mod1</b> resp. <b>Mod2</b>, they correspond to
Macintosh-specific modifier keys.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>Extended</b> modifier is, at present, specific to
Windows. It appears <big>&#9474;</big> on events that are
associated with the keys on the &ldquo;extended
keyboard&rdquo;. <big>&#9474;</big> On a US keyboard, the
extended keys include the <b>Alt</b> and <b>Control</b> keys
at <big>&#9474;</big> the right of the keyboard, the cursor
keys in the cluster to the left <big>&#9474;</big> of the
numeric pad, the <b>NumLock</b> key, the <b>Break</b> key,
the <b>PrintScreen</b> <big>&#9474;</big> key, and the
<b>/</b> and <b>Enter</b> keys in the numeric keypad.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>EVENT
TYPES</b> <br>
The <i>type</i> field may be any of the standard X event
types, with a few extra abbreviations. The <i>type</i> field
will also accept a couple non-standard X event types that
were added to better support the Macintosh and Windows
platforms. Below is a list of all the valid types; where two
names appear together, they are synonyms. <b>Activate
Destroy Map ButtonPress</b>, <b>Button Enter MapRequest
ButtonRelease Expose Motion Circulate FocusIn MouseWheel
CirculateRequest FocusOut Property Colormap Gravity Reparent
Configure KeyPress</b>, <b>Key ResizeRequest
ConfigureRequest KeyRelease Unmap Create Leave Visibility
Deactivate</b> Most of the above events have the same fields
and behaviors as events in the X Windowing system. You can
find more detailed descriptions of these events in any X
window programming book. A couple of the events are
extensions to the X event system to support features unique
to the Macintosh and Windows platforms. We provide a little
more detail on these events here. These include: <b><br>
Activate</b>, <b>Deactivate</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">These two events are sent to
every sub-window of a toplevel when they change state. In
addition to the focus Window, the Macintosh platform and
Windows platforms have a notion of an active window (which
often has but is not required to have the focus). On the
Macintosh, widgets in the active window have a different
appearance than widgets in deactive windows. The
<b>Activate</b> event is sent to all the sub-windows in a
toplevel when it changes from being deactive to active.
Likewise, the <b>Deactive</b> event is sent when the
window&rsquo;s state changes from active to deactive. There
are no useful percent substitutions you would make when
binding to these events.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>MouseWheel</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Many contemporary mice support
a mouse wheel, which is used for scrolling documents without
using the scrollbars. By rolling the wheel, the system will
generate <b>MouseWheel</b> events that the application can
use to scroll. Like <b>Key</b> events the event is always
routed to the window that currently has focus. When the
event is received you can use the <b>%D</b> substitution to
get the <i>delta</i> field for the event, which is a integer
value describing how the mouse wheel has moved. The smallest
value for which the system will report is defined by the OS.
On Windows 95 &amp; 98 machines this value is at least 120
before it is reported. However, higher resolution devices
may be available in the future. The sign of the value
determines which direction your widget should scroll.
Positive values should scroll up and negative values should
scroll down.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>KeyPress</b>,
<b>KeyRelease</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The <b>KeyPress</b> and
<b>KeyRelease</b> events are generated whenever a key is
pressed or released. <b>KeyPress</b> and <b>KeyRelease</b>
events are sent to the window which currently has the
keyboard focus.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>ButtonPress</b>,
<b>ButtonRelease</b>, <b>Motion</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The <b>ButtonPress</b> and
<b>ButtonRelease</b> events are generated when the user
presses or releases a mouse button. <b>Motion</b> events are
generated whenever the pointer is moved. <b>ButtonPress</b>,
<b>ButtonRelease</b>, and <b>Motion</b> events are normally
sent to the window containing the pointer.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">When a mouse
button is pressed, the window containing the pointer
automatically obtains a temporary pointer grab. Subsequent
<b>ButtonPress</b>, <b>ButtonRelease</b>, and <b>Motion</b>
events will be sent to that window, regardless of which
window contains the pointer, until all buttons have been
released.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Configure</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">A <b>Configure</b> event is
sent to a window whenever its size, position, or border
width changes, and sometimes when it has changed position in
the stacking order.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Map</b>, <b>Unmap</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The <b>Map</b> and <b>Unmap</b>
events are generated whenever the mapping state of a window
changes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">Windows are
created in the unmapped state. Top-level windows become
mapped when they transition to the <b>normal</b> state, and
are unmapped in the <b>withdrawn</b> and <b>iconic</b>
states. Other windows become mapped when they are placed
under control of a geometry manager (for example <b>pack</b>
or <b>grid</b>).</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">A window is
<i>viewable</i> only if it and all of its ancestors are
mapped. Note that geometry managers typically do not map
their children until they have been mapped themselves, and
unmap all children when they become unmapped; hence in Tk
<b>Map</b> and <b>Unmap</b> events indicate whether or not a
window is viewable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Visibility</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">A window is said to be
<i>obscured</i> when another window above it in the stacking
order fully or partially overlaps it. <b>Visibility</b>
events are generated whenever a window&rsquo;s obscurity
state changes; the <i>state</i> field (<b>%s</b>) specifies
the new state.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Expose</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">An <b>Expose</b> event is
generated whenever all or part of a window should be redrawn
(for example, when a window is first mapped or if it becomes
unobscured). It is normally not necessary for client
applications to handle <b>Expose</b> events, since Tk
handles them internally.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Destroy</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">A <b>Destroy</b> event is
delivered to a window when it is destroyed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">When the
<b>Destroy</b> event is delivered to a widget, it is in a
&ldquo;half-dead&rdquo; state: the widget still exists, but
most operations on it will fail.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>FocusIn</b>,
<b>FocusOut</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The <b>FocusIn</b> and
<b>FocusOut</b> events are generated whenever the keyboard
focus changes. A <b>FocusOut</b> event is sent to the old
focus window, and a <b>FocusIn</b> event is sent to the new
one.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">In addition, if
the old and new focus windows do not share a common parent,
&ldquo;virtual crossing&rdquo; focus events are sent to the
intermediate windows in the hierarchy. Thus a <b>FocusIn</b>
event indicates that the target window or one of its
descendants has acquired the focus, and a <b>FocusOut</b>
event indicates that the focus has been changed to a window
outside the target window&rsquo;s hierarchy.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">The keyboard
focus may be changed explicitly by a call to <b>focus</b>,
or implicitly by the window manager.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Enter</b>, <b>Leave</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">An <b>Enter</b> event is sent
to a window when the pointer enters that window, and a
<b>Leave</b> event is sent when the pointer leaves it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">If there is a
pointer grab in effect, <b>Enter</b> and <b>Leave</b> events
are only delivered to the window owning the grab.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">In addition,
when the pointer moves between two windows, <b>Enter</b> and
<b>Leave</b> &ldquo;virtual crossing&rdquo; events are sent
to intermediate windows in the hierarchy in the same manner
as for <b>FocusIn</b> and <b>FocusOut</b> events.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Property</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">A <b>Property</b> event is sent
to a window whenever an X property belonging to that window
is changed or deleted. <b>Property</b> events are not
normally delivered to Tk applications as they are handled by
the Tk core.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Colormap</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">A <b>Colormap</b> event is
generated whenever the colormap associated with a window has
been changed, installed, or uninstalled.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">Widgets may be
assigned a private colormap by specifying a
<b>&minus;colormap</b> option; the window manager is
responsible for installing and uninstalling colormaps as
necessary.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">Note that Tk
provides no useful details for this event type.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>MapRequest</b>,
<b>CirculateRequest</b>, <b>ResizeRequest</b>,
<b>ConfigureRequest</b>, <b>Create</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">These events are not normally
delivered to Tk applications. They are included for
completeness, to make it possible to write X11 window
managers in Tk. (These events are only delivered when a
client has selected <b>SubstructureRedirectMask</b> on a
window; the Tk core does not use this mask.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Gravity</b>,
<b>Reparent</b>, <b>Circulate</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The events <b>Gravity</b> and
<b>Reparent</b> are not normally delivered to Tk
applications. They are included for completeness.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">A
<b>Circulate</b> event indicates that the window has moved
to the top or to the bottom of the stacking order as a
result of an <b>XCirculateSubwindows</b> protocol request.
Note that the stacking order may be changed for other
reasons which do not generate a <b>Circulate</b> event, and
that Tk does not use <b>XCirculateSubwindows()</b>
internally. This event type is included only for
completeness; there is no reliable way to track changes to a
window&rsquo;s position in the stacking order.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>EVENT
DETAILS</b> <br>
The last part of a long event specification is
<i>detail</i>. In the case of a <b>ButtonPress</b> or
<b>ButtonRelease</b> event, it is the number of a button
(1&minus;5). If a button number is given, then only an event
on that particular button will match; if no button number is
given, then an event on any button will match. Note: giving
a specific button number is different than specifying a
button modifier; in the first case, it refers to a button
being pressed or released, while in the second it refers to
some other button that is already depressed when the
matching event occurs. If a button number is given then
<i>type</i> may be omitted: if will default to
<b>ButtonPress</b>. For example, the specifier
<b>&lt;1&gt;</b> is equivalent to
<b>&lt;ButtonPress&minus;1&gt;</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the event
type is <b>KeyPress</b> or <b>KeyRelease</b>, then
<i>detail</i> may be specified in the form of an X keysym.
Keysyms are textual specifications for particular keys on
the keyboard; they include all the alphanumeric ASCII
characters (e.g. &ldquo;a&rdquo; is the keysym for the ASCII
character &ldquo;a&rdquo;), plus descriptions for
non-alphanumeric characters (&ldquo;comma&rdquo;is the
keysym for the comma character), plus descriptions for all
the non-ASCII keys on the keyboard (e.g.
&ldquo;Shift_L&rdquo; is the keysym for the left shift key,
and &ldquo;F1&rdquo; is the keysym for the F1 function key,
if it exists). The complete list of keysyms is not presented
here; it is available in other X documentation and may vary
from system to system. If necessary, you can use the
<b>%K</b> notation described below to print out the keysym
name for a particular key. If a keysym <i>detail</i> is
given, then the <i>type</i> field may be omitted; it will
default to <b>KeyPress</b>. For example,
<b>&lt;Control&minus;comma&gt;</b> is equivalent to
<b>&lt;Control&minus;KeyPress&minus;comma&gt;</b>.</p>

<h2>BINDING SCRIPTS AND SUBSTITUTIONS
<a name="BINDING SCRIPTS AND SUBSTITUTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>script</i> argument to <b>bind</b> is a Tcl script, which
will be executed whenever the given event sequence occurs.
<i>Command</i> will be executed in the same interpreter that
the <b>bind</b> command was executed in, and it will run at
global level (only global variables will be accessible). If
<i>script</i> contains any <b>%</b> characters, then the
script will not be executed directly. Instead, a new script
will be generated by replacing each <b>%</b>, and the
character following it, with information from the current
event. The replacement depends on the character following
the <b>%</b>, as defined in the list below. Unless otherwise
indicated, the replacement string is the decimal value of
the given field from the current event. Some of the
substitutions are only valid for certain types of events; if
they are used for other types of events the value
substituted is undefined.</p>

string for a %-replacement is formatted as a proper Tcl list

This guarantees that the string will be passed through the
Tcl parser when the binding script is evaluated. Most
replacements are numbers or well-defined strings such as
<b>Above</b>; for these replacements no special formatting
is ever necessary. The most common case where reformatting
occurs is for the <b>%A</b> substitution. For example, if
<i>script</i> is</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>insert %A</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">and the character typed is an
open square bracket, then the script actually executed will
be</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>insert \[</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">This will cause the
<b>insert</b> to receive the original replacement string
(open square bracket) as its first argument. If the extra
backslash had not been added, Tcl would not have been able
to parse the script correctly.</p>

<h2>MULTIPLE MATCHES
<a name="MULTIPLE MATCHES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is possible
for several bindings to match a given X event. If the
bindings are associated with different <i>tag</i>&rsquo;s,
then each of the bindings will be executed, in order. By
default, a binding for the widget will be executed first,
followed by a class binding, a binding for its toplevel, and
an <b>all</b> binding. The <b>bindtags</b> command may be
used to change this order for a particular window or to
associate additional binding tags with the window.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>continue</b> and <b>break</b> commands may be used inside
a binding script to control the processing of matching
scripts. If <b>continue</b> is invoked, then the current
binding script is terminated but Tk will continue processing
binding scripts associated with other <i>tag</i>&rsquo;s. If
the <b>break</b> command is invoked within a binding script,
then that script terminates and no other scripts will be
invoked for the event.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If more than
one binding matches a particular event and they have the
same <i>tag</i>, then the most specific binding is chosen
and its script is evaluated. The following tests are
applied, in order, to determine which of several matching
sequences is more specific:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the matching
sequences contain more than one event, then tests
(c)&minus;(e) are applied in order from the most recent
event to the least recent event in the sequences. If these
tests fail to determine a winner, then the most recently
registered sequence is the winner.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If there are
two (or more) virtual events that are both triggered by the
same sequence, and both of those virtual events are bound to
the same window tag, then only one of the virtual events
will be triggered, and it will be picked at random:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">event add &lt;&lt;Paste&gt;&gt;
&lt;Control&minus;y&gt; <br>
event add &lt;&lt;Paste&gt;&gt; &lt;Button&minus;2&gt; <br>

bind</b> Entry &lt;&lt;Paste&gt;&gt; {puts Paste} <b><br>
bind</b> Entry &lt;&lt;Scroll&gt;&gt; {puts Scroll}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">If the user types
Control&minus;y, the <b>&lt;&lt;Paste&gt;&gt;</b> binding
will be invoked, but if the user presses button 2 then one
of either the <b>&lt;&lt;Paste&gt;&gt;</b> or the
<b>&lt;&lt;Scroll&gt;&gt;</b> bindings will be invoked, but
exactly which one gets invoked is undefined.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If an X event
does not match any of the existing bindings, then the event
is ignored. An unbound event is not considered to be an
error.</p>

<h2>MULTI-EVENT SEQUENCES AND IGNORED EVENTS
<a name="MULTI-EVENT SEQUENCES AND IGNORED EVENTS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When a
<i>sequence</i> specified in a <b>bind</b> command contains
more than one event pattern, then its script is executed
whenever the recent events (leading up to and including the
current event) match the given sequence. This means, for
example, that if button 1 is clicked repeatedly the sequence
<b>&lt;Double&minus;ButtonPress&minus;1&gt;</b> will match
each button press but the first. If extraneous events that
would prevent a match occur in the middle of an event
sequence then the extraneous events are ignored unless they
are <b>KeyPress</b> or <b>ButtonPress</b> events. For
example, <b>&lt;Double&minus;ButtonPress&minus;1&gt;</b>
will match a sequence of presses of button 1, even though
there will be <b>ButtonRelease</b> events (and possibly
<b>Motion</b> events) between the <b>ButtonPress</b> events.
Furthermore, a <b>KeyPress</b> event may be preceded by any
number of other <b>KeyPress</b> events for modifier keys
without the modifier keys preventing a match. For example,
the event sequence <b>aB</b> will match a press of the
<b>a</b> key, a release of the <b>a</b> key, a press of the
<b>Shift</b> key, and a press of the <b>b</b> key: the press
of <b>Shift</b> is ignored because it is a modifier key.
Finally, if several <b>Motion</b> events occur in a row,
only the last one is used for purposes of matching binding
sequences.</p>

<h2>ERRORS
<a name="ERRORS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If an error
occurs in executing the script for a binding then the
<b>bgerror</b> mechanism is used to report the error. The
<b>bgerror</b> command will be executed at global level
(outside the context of any Tcl procedure).</p>
