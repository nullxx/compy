<h2>SYNOPSIS

</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>#include
&lt;pthread.h&gt;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>int

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>pthread_atfork</i>() function shall declare fork handlers
to be called before and after <i>fork</i>(), in the context
of the thread that called <i>fork</i>(). The <i>prepare</i>
fork handler shall be called before <i>fork</i>() processing
commences. The <i>parent</i> fork handle shall be called
after <i>fork</i>() processing completes in the parent
process. The <i>child</i> fork handler shall be called after
<i>fork</i>() processing completes in the child process. If
no handling is desired at one or more of these three points,
the corresponding fork handler address(es) may be set to
NULL.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The order of
calls to <i>pthread_atfork</i>() is significant. The
<i>parent</i> and <i>child</i> fork handlers shall be called
in the order in which they were established by calls to
<i>pthread_atfork</i>(). The <i>prepare</i> fork handlers
shall be called in the opposite order.</p>

<h2>RETURN VALUE
<a name="RETURN VALUE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Upon successful
completion, <i>pthread_atfork</i>() shall return a value of
zero; otherwise, an error number shall be returned to
indicate the error.</p>

<h2>ERRORS
<a name="ERRORS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>pthread_atfork</i>() function shall fail if:</p>

<h2>RATIONALE
<a name="RATIONALE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There are at
least two serious problems with the semantics of
<i>fork</i>() in a multi-threaded program. One problem has
to do with state (for example, memory) covered by mutexes.
Consider the case where one thread has a mutex locked and
the state covered by that mutex is inconsistent while
another thread calls <i>fork</i>(). In the child, the mutex
is in the locked state (locked by a nonexistent thread and
thus can never be unlocked). Having the child simply
reinitialize the mutex is unsatisfactory since this approach
does not resolve the question about how to correct or
otherwise deal with the inconsistent state in the child.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is suggested
that programs that use <i>fork</i>() call an <i>exec</i>
function very soon afterwards in the child process, thus
resetting all states. In the meantime, only a short list of
async-signal-safe library routines are promised to be
available.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Unfortunately,
this solution does not address the needs of multi-threaded
libraries. Application programs may not be aware that a
multi-threaded library is in use, and they feel free to call
any number of library routines between the <i>fork</i>() and
<i>exec</i> calls, just as they always have. Indeed, they
may be extant single-threaded programs and cannot,
therefore, be expected to obey new restrictions imposed by
the threads library.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On the other
hand, the multi-threaded library needs a way to protect its
internal state during <i>fork</i>() in case it is re-entered
later in the child process. The problem arises especially in
multi-threaded I/O libraries, which are almost sure to be
invoked between the <i>fork</i>() and <i>exec</i> calls to
effect I/O redirection. The solution may require locking
mutex variables during <i>fork</i>(), or it may entail
simply resetting the state in the child after the
<i>fork</i>() processing completes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>pthread_atfork</i>() function provides multi-threaded
libraries with a means to protect themselves from innocent
application programs that call <i>fork</i>(), and it
provides multi-threaded application programs with a standard
mechanism for protecting themselves from <i>fork</i>() calls
in a library routine or the application itself.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The expected
usage is that the <i>prepare</i> handler acquires all mutex
locks and the other two fork handlers release them.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For example, an
application can supply a <i>prepare</i> routine that
acquires the necessary mutexes the library maintains and
supply <i>child</i> and <i>parent</i> routines that release
those mutexes, thus ensuring that the child gets a
consistent snapshot of the state of the library (and that no
mutexes are left stranded). Alternatively, some libraries
might be able to supply just a <i>child</i> routine that
reinitializes the mutexes in the library and all associated
states to some known value (for example, what it was when
the image was originally executed).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When
<i>fork</i>() is called, only the calling thread is
duplicated in the child process. Synchronization variables
remain in the same state in the child as they were in the
parent at the time <i>fork</i>() was called. Thus, for
example, mutex locks may be held by threads that no longer
exist in the child process, and any associated states may be
inconsistent. The parent process may avoid this by explicit
code that acquires and releases locks critical to the child
via <i>pthread_atfork</i>(). In addition, any critical
threads need to be recreated and reinitialized to the proper
state in the child (also via <i>pthread_atfork</i>()).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A higher-level
package may acquire locks on its own data structures before
invoking lower-level packages. Under this scenario, the
order specified for fork handler calls allows a simple rule
of initialization for avoiding package deadlock: a package
initializes all packages on which it depends before it calls
the <i>pthread_atfork</i>() function for itself.</p>
