<h2>NAME
<a name="NAME"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">git-receive-pack
&minus; Receive what is pushed into the repository</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>git&minus;receive&minus;pack</i>
&lt;directory&gt;</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Invoked by
<i>git send&minus;pack</i> and updates the repository with
the information fed from the remote end.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This command is
usually not invoked directly by the end user. The UI for the
protocol is on the <i>git send&minus;pack</i> side, and the
program pair is meant to be used to push updates to remote
repository. For pull operations, see
<b>git-fetch-pack</b>(1).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The command
allows for creation and fast&minus;forwarding of sha1 refs
(heads/tags) on the remote end (strictly speaking, it is the
local end <i>git&minus;receive&minus;pack</i> runs, but to
the user who is sitting at the send&minus;pack end, it is
updating the remote. Confused?)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There are other
real&minus;world examples of using update and
post&minus;update hooks found in the Documentation/howto
directory.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>git&minus;receive&minus;pack</i>
honours the receive.denyNonFastForwards config option, which
tells it if updates to a ref should be denied if they are
not fast&minus;forwards.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&lt;directory&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The repository to sync
into.</p>

<h2>PRE-RECEIVE HOOK
<a name="PRE-RECEIVE HOOK"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Before any ref
is updated, if $GIT_DIR/hooks/pre&minus;receive file exists
and is executable, it will be invoked once with no
parameters. The standard input of the hook will be one line
per ref to be updated:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">sha1&minus;old
SP sha1&minus;new SP refname LF</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The refname
value is relative to $GIT_DIR; e.g. for the master head this
is &quot;refs/heads/master&quot;. The two sha1 values before
each refname are the object names for the refname before and
after the update. Refs to be created will have
sha1&minus;old equal to 0{40}, while refs to be deleted will
have sha1&minus;new equal to 0{40}, otherwise sha1&minus;old
and sha1&minus;new should be valid objects in the
repository.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This hook is
called before any refname is updated and before any
fast&minus;forward checks are performed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the
pre&minus;receive hook exits with a non&minus;zero exit
status no updates will be performed, and the update,
post&minus;receive and post&minus;update hooks will not be
invoked either. This can be useful to quickly bail out if
the update is not to be supported.</p>

<h2>UPDATE HOOK
<a name="UPDATE HOOK"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Before each ref
is updated, if $GIT_DIR/hooks/update file exists and is
executable, it is invoked once per ref, with three
parameters:</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">$GIT_DIR/hooks/update
refname sha1&minus;old sha1&minus;new</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The refname
parameter is relative to $GIT_DIR; e.g. for the master head
this is &quot;refs/heads/master&quot;. The two sha1
arguments are the object names for the refname before and
after the update. Note that the hook is called before the
refname is updated, so either sha1&minus;old is 0{40}
(meaning there is no such ref yet), or it should match what
is recorded in refname.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The hook should
exit with non&minus;zero status if it wants to disallow
updating the named ref. Otherwise it should exit with
zero.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Successful
execution (a zero exit status) of this hook does not ensure
the ref will actually be updated, it is only a prerequisite.
As such it is not a good idea to send notices (e.g. email)
from this hook. Consider using the post&minus;receive hook
instead.</p>

<h2>POST-RECEIVE HOOK
<a name="POST-RECEIVE HOOK"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">After all refs
were updated (or attempted to be updated), if any ref update
was successful, and if $GIT_DIR/hooks/post&minus;receive
file exists and is executable, it will be invoked once with
no parameters. The standard input of the hook will be one
line for each successfully updated ref:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">sha1&minus;old
SP sha1&minus;new SP refname LF</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The refname
value is relative to $GIT_DIR; e.g. for the master head this
is &quot;refs/heads/master&quot;. The two sha1 values before
each refname are the object names for the refname before and
after the update. Refs that were created will have
sha1&minus;old equal to 0{40}, while refs that were deleted
will have sha1&minus;new equal to 0{40}, otherwise
sha1&minus;old and sha1&minus;new should be valid objects in
the repository.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Using this
hook, it is easy to generate mails describing the updates to
the repository. This example script sends one mail message
per ref listing the commits pushed to the repository:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">#!/bin/sh <br>
# mail out commit update information. <br>
while read oval nval ref <br>
do <br>
if expr &quot;$oval&quot; : '0*$' &gt;/dev/null <br>
then <br>
echo &quot;Created a new ref, with the following
commits:&quot; <br>
git rev&minus;list &minus;&minus;pretty &quot;$nval&quot;
<br>
else <br>
echo &quot;New commits:&quot; <br>
git rev&minus;list &minus;&minus;pretty &quot;$nval&quot;
&quot;^$oval&quot; <br>
fi | <br>
mail &minus;s &quot;Changes to ref $ref&quot;
commit&minus;list@mydomain <br>
done <br>
exit 0</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The exit code
from this hook invocation is ignored, however a
non&minus;zero exit code will generate an error message.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that it is
possible for refname to not have sha1&minus;new when this
hook runs. This can easily occur if another user modifies
the ref after it was updated by
<i>git&minus;receive&minus;pack</i>, but before the hook was
able to evaluate it. It is recommended that hooks rely on
sha1&minus;new rather than the current value of refname.</p>

<h2>POST-UPDATE HOOK
<a name="POST-UPDATE HOOK"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">After all other
processing, if at least one ref was updated, and if
$GIT_DIR/hooks/post&minus;update file exists and is
executable, then post&minus;update will be called with the
list of refs that have been updated. This can be used to
implement any repository wide cleanup tasks.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The exit code
from this hook invocation is ignored; the only thing left
for <i>git&minus;receive&minus;pack</i> to do at that point
is to exit itself anyway.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This hook can
be used, for example, to run git
update&minus;server&minus;info if the repository is packed
and is served via a dumb transport.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">#!/bin/sh <br>
exec git update&minus;server&minus;info</p>
