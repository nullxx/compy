<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
is the old c2ph.doc documentation by Tom Christiansen
&lt;tchrist@perl.com&gt; Date: 25 Jul 91 08:10:21
<small>GMT</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Once upon a
time, I wrote a program called pstruct. It was a perl
program that tried to parse out C structures and display
their member offsets for you. This was especially useful for
people looking at binary dumps or poking around the
kernel.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Pstruct was not
a pretty program. Neither was it particularly robust. The
problem, you see, was that the C compiler was much better at
parsing C than I could ever hope to be.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">So I got smart:
I decided to be lazy and let the C compiler parse the C,
which would spit out debugger stabs for me to read. These
were much easier to parse. It&rsquo;s still not a pretty
program, but at least it&rsquo;s more robust.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Pstruct takes
any .c or .h files, or preferably .s ones, since
that&rsquo;s the format it is going to massage them into
anyway, and spits out listings like this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">etc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Actually, this
was generated by a particular set of options. You can
control the formatting of each column, whether you prefer
wide or fat, hex or decimal, leading zeroes or whatever.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">All you need to
be able to use this is a C compiler than generates
BSD/GCC&minus;style stabs. The <b>&minus;g</b> option on
native <small>BSD</small> compilers and <small>GCC</small>
should get this for you.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To learn more,
just type a bogus option, like <b>&minus;\?</b>, and a long
usage message will be provided. There are a fair number of
possibilities.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you&rsquo;re
only a C programmer, than this is the end of the message for
you. You can quit right now, and if you care to, save off
the source and run it when you feel like it. Or not.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">But if
you&rsquo;re a perl programmer, then for you I have
something much more wondrous than just a structure offset
printer.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You see, if you
call pstruct by its other incybernation, c2ph, you have a
code generator that translates C code into perl code! Well,
structure and union declarations at least, but that&rsquo;s
quite a bit.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Prior to this
point, anyone programming in perl who wanted to interact
with C programs, like the kernel, was forced to guess the
layouts of the C structures, and then hardwire these into
his program. Of course, when you took your wonderfully
crafted program to a system where the sgtty structure was
laid out differently, your program broke. Which is a
shame.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">We&rsquo;ve had
Larry&rsquo;s h2ph translator, which helped, but that only
works on cpp symbols, not real C, which was also very much
needed. What I offer you is a symbolic way of getting at all
the C structures. I&rsquo;ve couched them in terms of
packages and functions. Consider the following program:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    #!/usr/local/bin/perl
    require 'syscall.ph';
    require 'sys/time.ph';
    require 'sys/resource.ph';
    $ru = &quot;\0&quot; x &amp;rusage'sizeof();
    syscall(&amp;SYS_getrusage, &amp;RUSAGE_SELF, $ru)      &amp;&amp; die &quot;getrusage: $!&quot;;
    @ru = unpack($t = &amp;rusage'typedef(), $ru);
    $utime =  $ru[ &amp;rusage'ru_utime + &amp;timeval'tv_sec  ]
           + ($ru[ &amp;rusage'ru_utime + &amp;timeval'tv_usec ]) / 1e6;
    $stime =  $ru[ &amp;rusage'ru_stime + &amp;timeval'tv_sec  ]
           + ($ru[ &amp;rusage'ru_stime + &amp;timeval'tv_usec ]) / 1e6;
    printf &quot;you have used %8.3fs+%8.3fu seconds.\n&quot;, $utime, $stime;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As you see, the
name of the package is the name of the structure. Regular
fields are just their own names. Plus the following accessor
functions are provided for your convenience:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    struct      This takes no arguments, and is merely the number of first&minus;level
                elements in the structure.  You would use this for indexing
                into arrays of structures, perhaps like this
                    $usec = $u[ &amp;user'u_utimer
                                + (&amp;ITIMER_VIRTUAL * &amp;itimerval'struct)
                                + &amp;itimerval'it_value
                                + &amp;timeval'tv_usec
                              ];
    sizeof      Returns the bytes in the structure, or the member if
                you pass it an argument, such as
                        &amp;rusage'sizeof(&amp;rusage'ru_utime)
    typedef     This is the perl format definition for passing to pack and
                unpack.  If you ask for the typedef of a nothing, you get
                the whole structure, otherwise you get that of the member
                you ask for.  Padding is taken care of, as is the magic to
                guarantee that a union is unpacked into all its aliases.
                Bitfields are not quite yet supported however.
    offsetof    This function is the byte offset into the array of that
                member.  You may wish to use this for indexing directly
                into the packed structure with vec() if you're too lazy
                to unpack it.
    typeof      Not to be confused with the typedef accessor function, this
                one returns the C type of that field.  This would allow
                you to print out a nice structured pretty print of some
                structure without knoning anything about it beforehand.
                No args to this one is a noop.  Someday I'll post such
                a thing to dump out your u structure for you.</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The way I see
this being used is like basically this:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">        % h2ph &lt;some_include_file.h  &gt;  /usr/lib/perl/tmp.ph
        % c2ph  some_include_file.h  &gt;&gt; /usr/lib/perl/tmp.ph
        % install</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It&rsquo;s a
little tricker with c2ph because you have to get the
includes right. I can&rsquo;t know this for your system, but
it&rsquo;s not usually too terribly difficult.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The code
isn&rsquo;t pretty as I mentioned -- I never thought it
would be a 1000&minus; line program when I started, or I
might not have begun. :&minus;) But I would have been less
cavalier in how the parts of the program communicated with
each other, etc. It might also have helped if I didn&rsquo;t
have to divine the makeup of the stabs on the fly, and then
account for micro differences between my compiler and
gcc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Anyway, here it
is. Should run on perl v4 or greater. Maybe less.</p>
