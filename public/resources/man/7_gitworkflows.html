&minus; An overview of recommended workflows with Git</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">git *</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This document
attempts to write down and motivate some of the workflow
elements used for git.git itself. Many ideas apply in
general, though the full workflow is rarely required for
smaller projects with fewer people involved.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">We formulate a
set of <i>rules</i> for quick reference, while the prose
tries to motivate each of them. Do not always take them
literally; you should value good reasons for your actions
higher than manpages such as this one.</p>

<h2>SEPARATE CHANGES
<a name="SEPARATE CHANGES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As a general
rule, you should try to split your changes into small
logical steps, and commit each of them. They should be
consistent, working independently of any later commits, pass
the test suite, etc. This makes the review process much
easier, and the history much more useful for later
inspection and analysis, for example with
<b>git-blame</b>(1) and <b>git-bisect</b>(1).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To achieve
this, try to split your work into small steps from the very
beginning. It is always easier to squash a few commits
together than to split one big commit into several.
Don&rsquo;t be afraid of making too small or imperfect steps
along the way. You can always go back later and edit the
commits with git rebase &minus;&minus;interactive before you
publish them. You can use git stash save
&minus;&minus;keep&minus;index to run the test suite
independent of other uncommitted changes; see the EXAMPLES
section of <b>git-stash</b>(1).</p>

<h2>MANAGING BRANCHES
<a name="MANAGING BRANCHES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There are two
main tools that can be used to include changes from one
branch on another: <b>git-merge</b>(1) and
<b>git-cherry-pick</b>(1).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Merges have
many advantages, so we try to solve as many problems as
possible with merges alone. Cherry&minus;picking is still
occasionally useful; see &quot;Merging upwards&quot; below
for an example.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Most
importantly, merging works at the branch level, while
cherry&minus;picking works at the commit level. This means
that a merge can carry over the changes from 1, 10, or 1000
commits with equal ease, which in turn means the workflow
scales much better to a large number of contributors (and
contributions). Merges are also easier to understand because
a merge commit is a &quot;promise&quot; that all changes
from all its parents are now included.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There is a
tradeoff of course: merges require a more careful branch
management. The following subsections discuss the important
points.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Graduation</b>
<br>
As a given feature goes from experimental to stable, it also
&quot;graduates&quot; between the corresponding branches of
the software. git.git uses the following <i>integration
branches</i>:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
<i>maint</i> tracks the commits that should go into the next
&quot;maintenance release&quot;, i.e., update of the last
released stable version;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
<i>master</i> tracks the commits that should go into the
next release;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
<i>next</i> is intended as a testing branch for topics being
tested for stability for master.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There is a
fourth official branch that is used slightly
differently:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
<i>pu</i> (proposed updates) is an integration branch for
things that are not quite ready for inclusion yet (see
&quot;Integration Branches&quot; below).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Each of the
four branches is usually a direct descendant of the one
above it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Conceptually,
the feature enters at an unstable branch (usually
<i>next</i> or <i>pu</i>), and &quot;graduates&quot; to
<i>master</i> for the next release once it is considered
stable enough.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Merging
upwards</b> <br>
The &quot;downwards graduation&quot; discussed above cannot
be done by actually merging downwards, however, since that
would merge <i>all</i> changes on the unstable branch into
the stable one. Hence the following:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Example&nbsp;1.&nbsp;Merge
upwards</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Always commit
your fixes to the oldest supported branch that require them.
Then (periodically) merge the integration branches upwards
into each other.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This gives a
very controlled flow of fixes. If you notice that you have
applied a fix to e.g. <i>master</i> that is also required in
<i>maint</i>, you will need to cherry&minus;pick it (using
<b>git-cherry-pick</b>(1)) downwards. This will happen a few
times and is nothing to worry about unless you do it very
frequently.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Topic
branches</b> <br>
Any nontrivial feature will require several patches to
implement, and may get extra bugfixes or improvements during
its lifetime.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Committing
everything directly on the integration branches leads to
many problems: Bad commits cannot be undone, so they must be
reverted one by one, which creates confusing histories and
further error potential when you forget to revert part of a
group of changes. Working in parallel mixes up the changes,
creating further confusion.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Use of
&quot;topic branches&quot; solves these problems. The name
is pretty self explanatory, with a caveat that comes from
the &quot;merge upwards&quot; rule above:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Example&nbsp;2.&nbsp;Topic
branches</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Make a side
branch for every topic (feature, bugfix, ...). Fork it off
at the oldest integration branch that you will eventually
want to merge it into.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Many things can
then be done very naturally:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; To get
the feature/bugfix into an integration branch, simply merge
it. If the topic has evolved further in the meantime, merge
again. (Note that you do not necessarily have to merge it to
the oldest integration branch first. For example, you can
first merge a bugfix to <i>next</i>, give it some testing
time, and merge to <i>maint</i> when you know it is
stable.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; If you
find you need new features from the branch <i>other</i> to
continue working on your topic, merge <i>other</i> to
<i>topic</i>. (However, do not do this &quot;just
habitually&quot;, see below.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; If you
find you forked off the wrong branch and want to move it
&quot;back in time&quot;, use <b>git-rebase</b>(1).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that the
last point clashes with the other two: a topic that has been
merged elsewhere should not be rebased. See the section on
RECOVERING FROM UPSTREAM REBASE in <b>git-rebase</b>(1).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">We should point
out that &quot;habitually&quot; (regularly for no real
reason) merging an integration branch into your topics
&mdash; and by extension, merging anything upstream into
anything downstream on a regular basis &mdash; is frowned
upon:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Example&nbsp;3.&nbsp;Merge
to downstream only at well-defined points</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Do not merge to
downstream except with a good reason: upstream API changes
affect your branch; your branch no longer merges to upstream
cleanly; etc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Otherwise, the
topic that was merged to suddenly contains more than a
single (well&minus;separated) change. The many resulting
small merges will greatly clutter up history. Anyone who
later investigates the history of a file will have to find
out whether that merge affected the topic in development. An
upstream might even inadvertently be merged into a
&quot;more stable&quot; branch. And so on.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Throw&minus;away
integration</b> <br>
If you followed the last paragraph, you will now have many
small topic branches, and occasionally wonder how they
interact. Perhaps the result of merging them does not even
work? But on the other hand, we want to avoid merging them
anywhere &quot;stable&quot; because such merges cannot
easily be undone.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The solution,
of course, is to make a merge that we can undo: merge into a
throw&minus;away branch.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Example&nbsp;4.&nbsp;Throw-away
integration branches</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To test the
interaction of several topics, merge them into a
throw&minus;away branch. You must never base any work on
such a branch!</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you make it
(very) clear that this branch is going to be deleted right
after the testing, you can even publish this branch, for
example to give the testers a chance to work with it, or
other developers a chance to see if their in&minus;progress
work will be compatible. git.git has such an official
throw&minus;away integration branch called <i>pu</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Branch
management for a release</b> <br>
Assuming you are using the merge approach discussed above,
when you are releasing your project you will need to do some
additional branch management work.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A feature
release is created from the <i>master</i> branch, since
<i>master</i> tracks the commits that should go into the
next feature release.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>master</i> branch is supposed to be a superset of
<i>maint</i>. If this condition does not hold, then
<i>maint</i> contains some commits that are not included on
<i>master</i>. The fixes represented by those commits will
therefore not be included in your feature release.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To verify that
<i>master</i> is indeed a superset of <i>maint</i>, use git
log:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Example&nbsp;5.&nbsp;Verify</b>
<i>master</i> is a superset of <i>maint</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">git log
master..maint</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This command
should not list any commits. Otherwise, check out
<i>master</i> and merge <i>maint</i> into it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Now you can
proceed with the creation of the feature release. Apply a
tag to the tip of <i>master</i> indicating the release
version:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Example&nbsp;6.&nbsp;Release
tagging</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">git tag
&minus;s &minus;m &quot;Git X.Y.Z&quot; vX.Y.Z master</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You need to
push the new tag to a public Git server (see
&quot;DISTRIBUTED WORKFLOWS&quot; below). This makes the tag
available to others tracking your project. The push could
also trigger a post&minus;update hook to perform
release&minus;related items such as building release
tarballs and preformatted documentation pages.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Similarly, for
a maintenance release, <i>maint</i> is tracking the commits
to be released. Therefore, in the steps above simply tag and
push <i>maint</i> rather than <i>master</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Maintenance
branch management after a feature release</b> <br>
After a feature release, you need to manage your maintenance
branches.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">First, if you
wish to continue to release maintenance fixes for the
feature release made before the recent one, then you must
create another branch to track commits for that previous
release.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To do this, the
current maintenance branch is copied to another branch named
with the previous release version number (e.g.
maint&minus;X.Y.(Z&minus;1) where X.Y.Z is the current
release).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Example&nbsp;7.&nbsp;Copy
maint</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">git branch
maint&minus;X.Y.(Z&minus;1) maint</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>maint</i> branch should now be fast&minus;forwarded to
the newly released code so that maintenance fixes can be
tracked for the current release:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Example&nbsp;8.&nbsp;Update
maint to new release</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; git
checkout maint</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; git
merge &minus;&minus;ff&minus;only master</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the merge
fails because it is not a fast&minus;forward, then it is
possible some fixes on <i>maint</i> were missed in the
feature release. This will not happen if the content of the
branches was verified as described in the previous
section.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Branch
management for next and pu after a feature release</b> <br>
After a feature release, the integration branch <i>next</i>
may optionally be rewound and rebuilt from the tip of
<i>master</i> using the surviving topics on <i>next</i>:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Example&nbsp;9.&nbsp;Rewind
and rebuild next</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; git
checkout next</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; git
reset &minus;&minus;hard master</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; git
merge ai/topic_in_next1</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; git
merge ai/topic_in_next2</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; ...</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The advantage
of doing this is that the history of <i>next</i> will be
clean. For example, some topics merged into <i>next</i> may
have initially looked promising, but were later found to be
undesirable or premature. In such a case, the topic is
reverted out of <i>next</i> but the fact remains in the
history that it was once merged and reverted. By recreating
<i>next</i>, you give another incarnation of such topics a
clean slate to retry, and a feature release is a good point
in history to do so.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you do this,
then you should make a public announcement indicating that
<i>next</i> was rewound and rebuilt.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The same rewind
and rebuild process may be followed for <i>pu</i>. A public
announcement is not necessary since <i>pu</i> is a
throw&minus;away branch, as described above.</p>

<h2>DISTRIBUTED WORKFLOWS
<a name="DISTRIBUTED WORKFLOWS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">After the last
section, you should know how to manage topics. In general,
you will not be the only person working on the project, so
you will have to share your work.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Roughly
speaking, there are two important workflows: merge and
patch. The important difference is that the merge workflow
can propagate full history, including merges, while patches
cannot. Both workflows can be used in parallel: in git.git,
only subsystem maintainers use the merge workflow, while
everyone else sends patches.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that the
maintainer(s) may impose restrictions, such as
&quot;Signed&minus;off&minus;by&quot; requirements, that all
commits/patches submitted for inclusion must adhere to.
Consult your project&rsquo;s documentation for more
information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Merge
workflow</b> <br>
The merge workflow works by copying branches between
upstream and downstream. Upstream can merge contributions
into the official history; downstream base their work on the
official history.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There are three
main tools that can be used for this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
<b>git-push</b>(1) copies your branches to a remote
repository, usually to one that can be read by all involved
parties;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
<b>git-fetch</b>(1) that copies remote branches to your
repository; and</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
<b>git-pull</b>(1) that does fetch and merge in one go.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note the last
point. Do <i>not</i> use <i>git pull</i> unless you actually
want to merge the remote branch.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Getting changes
out is easy:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Example&nbsp;10.&nbsp;Push/pull:
Publishing branches/topics</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">git push
&lt;remote&gt; &lt;branch&gt; and tell everyone where they
can fetch from.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You will still
have to tell people by other means, such as mail. (Git
provides the <b>git-request-pull</b>(1) to send preformatted
pull requests to upstream maintainers to simplify this
task.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you just
want to get the newest copies of the integration branches,
staying up to date is easy too:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Example&nbsp;11.&nbsp;Push/pull:
Staying up to date</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Use git fetch
&lt;remote&gt; or git remote update to stay up to date.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Then simply
fork your topic branches from the stable remotes as
explained earlier.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you are a
maintainer and would like to merge other people&rsquo;s
topic branches to the integration branches, they will
typically send a request to do so by mail. Such a request
looks like</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Please pull
from <br>
&lt;url&gt; &lt;branch&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In that case,
<i>git pull</i> can do the fetch and merge in one go, as
follows.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Example&nbsp;12.&nbsp;Push/pull:
Merging remote topics</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">git pull
&lt;url&gt; &lt;branch&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Occasionally,
the maintainer may get merge conflicts when he tries to pull
changes from downstream. In this case, he can ask downstream
to do the merge and resolve the conflicts themselves
(perhaps they will know better how to resolve them). It is
one of the rare cases where downstream <i>should</i> merge
from upstream.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Patch
workflow</b> <br>
If you are a contributor that sends changes upstream in the
form of emails, you should use topic branches as usual (see
above). Then use <b>git-format-patch</b>(1) to generate the
corresponding emails (highly recommended over manually
formatting them because it makes the maintainer&rsquo;s life
easier).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Example&nbsp;13.&nbsp;format-patch/am:
Publishing branches/topics</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; git
format&minus;patch &minus;M upstream..topic to turn them
into preformatted patch files</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; git
send&minus;email &minus;&minus;to=&lt;recipient&gt;
&lt;patches&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">See the
<b>git-format-patch</b>(1) and <b>git-send-email</b>(1)
manpages for further usage notes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the
maintainer tells you that your patch no longer applies to
the current upstream, you will have to rebase your topic
(you cannot use a merge because you cannot
format&minus;patch merges):</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Example&nbsp;14.&nbsp;format-patch/am:
Keeping topics up to date</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">git pull
&minus;&minus;rebase &lt;url&gt; &lt;branch&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can then
fix the conflicts during the rebase. Presumably you have not
published your topic other than by mail, so rebasing it is
not a problem.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you receive
such a patch series (as maintainer, or perhaps as a reader
of the mailing list it was sent to), save the mails to
files, create a new topic branch and use <i>git am</i> to
import the commits:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Example&nbsp;15.&nbsp;format-patch/am:
Importing patches</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">git am &lt;
patch</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">One feature
worth pointing out is the three&minus;way merge, which can
help if you get conflicts: git am &minus;3 will use index
information contained in patches to figure out the merge
base. See <b>git-am</b>(1) for other options.</p>
