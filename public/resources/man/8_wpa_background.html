IEEE 802.11i</p>

<h2>WPA
<a name="WPA"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The original
security mechanism of IEEE 802.11 standard was not designed
to be strong and has proven to be insufficient for most
networks that require some kind of security. Task group I
(Security) of IEEE 802.11 working group
(http://www.ieee802.org/11/) has worked to address the flaws
of the base standard and has in practice completed its work
in May 2004. The IEEE 802.11i amendment to the IEEE 802.11
standard was approved in June 2004 and published in July
2004.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Wi-Fi Alliance
(http://www.wi-fi.org/) used a draft version of the IEEE
802.11i work (draft 3.0) to define a subset of the security
enhancements that can be implemented with existing wlan
hardware. This is called Wi-Fi Protected Access&lt;TM&gt;
(WPA). This has now become a mandatory component of
interoperability testing and certification done by Wi-Fi
Alliance. Wi-Fi provides information about WPA at its web
site
(http://www.wi-fi.org/OpenSection/protected_access.asp).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">IEEE 802.11
standard defined wired equivalent privacy (WEP) algorithm
for protecting wireless networks. WEP uses RC4 with 40-bit
keys, 24-bit initialization vector (IV), and CRC32 to
protect against packet forgery. All these choices have
proven to be insufficient: key space is too small against
current attacks, RC4 key scheduling is insufficient
(beginning of the pseudorandom stream should be skipped), IV
space is too small and IV reuse makes attacks easier, there
is no replay protection, and non-keyed authentication does
not protect against bit flipping packet data.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">WPA is an
intermediate solution for the security issues. It uses
Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP) to replace WEP. TKIP
is a compromise on strong security and possibility to use
existing hardware. It still uses RC4 for the encryption like
WEP, but with per-packet RC4 keys. In addition, it
implements replay protection, keyed packet authentication
mechanism (Michael MIC).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Keys can be
managed using two different mechanisms. WPA can either use
an external authentication server (e.g., RADIUS) and EAP
just like IEEE 802.1X is using or pre-shared keys without
need for additional servers. Wi-Fi calls these
&quot;WPA-Enterprise&quot; and &quot;WPA-Personal&quot;,
respectively. Both mechanisms will generate a master session
key for the Authenticator (AP) and Supplicant (client
station).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">WPA implements
a new key handshake (4-Way Handshake and Group Key
Handshake) for generating and exchanging data encryption
keys between the Authenticator and Supplicant. This
handshake is also used to verify that both Authenticator and
Supplicant know the master session key. These handshakes are
identical regardless of the selected key management
mechanism (only the method for generating master session key
changes).</p>

<h2>IEEE 802.11I / WPA2
<a name="IEEE 802.11I / WPA2"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The design for
parts of IEEE 802.11i that were not included in WPA has
finished (May 2004) and this amendment to IEEE 802.11 was
approved in June 2004. Wi-Fi Alliance is using the final
IEEE 802.11i as a new version of WPA called WPA2. This
includes, e.g., support for more robust encryption algorithm
(CCMP: AES in Counter mode with CBC-MAC) to replace TKIP and
optimizations for handoff (reduced number of messages in
initial key handshake, pre-authentication, and PMKSA
caching).</p>
