&minus; load functions only on demand</p>

</h2>


<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    package FOOBAR;
    use SelfLoader;
    ... (initializing code)
    __DATA__
    sub {....</pre>


<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This module
tells its users that functions in the <small>FOOBAR</small>
package are to be autoloaded from after the
<tt>&quot;__DATA__&quot;</tt> token. See also
&quot;Autoloading&quot; in perlsub.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>The __DATA__
token</b> <br>
The <tt>&quot;__DATA__&quot;</tt> token tells the perl
compiler that the perl code for compilation is finished.
Everything after the <tt>&quot;__DATA__&quot;</tt> token is
available for reading via the filehandle
<small>FOOBAR::DATA</small> , where <small>FOOBAR</small> is
the name of the current package when the
<tt>&quot;__DATA__&quot;</tt> token is reached. This works
just the same as <tt>&quot;__END__&quot;</tt> does in
package &rsquo;main&rsquo;, but for other modules data after
<tt>&quot;__END__&quot;</tt> is not automatically
retrievable, whereas data after
<tt>&quot;__DATA__&quot;</tt> is. The
<tt>&quot;__DATA__&quot;</tt> token is not recognized in
versions of perl prior to 5.001m.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that it is
possible to have <tt>&quot;__DATA__&quot;</tt> tokens in the
same package in multiple files, and that the last
<tt>&quot;__DATA__&quot;</tt> token in a given package that
is encountered by the compiler is the one accessible by the
filehandle. This also applies to
<tt>&quot;__END__&quot;</tt> and main, i.e. if the
&rsquo;main&rsquo; program has an
<tt>&quot;__END__&quot;</tt>, but a module
&rsquo;require&rsquo;d (_not_ &rsquo;use&rsquo;d) by that
program has a &rsquo;package main;&rsquo; declaration
followed by an &rsquo;<tt>&quot;__DATA__&quot;</tt>&rsquo;,
then the <tt>&quot;DATA&quot;</tt> filehandle is set to
access the data after the <tt>&quot;__DATA__&quot;</tt> in
the module, _not_ the data after the
<tt>&quot;__END__&quot;</tt> token in the &rsquo;main&rsquo;
program, since the compiler encounters the
&rsquo;require&rsquo;d file later.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>SelfLoader
autoloading</b> <br>
The <b>SelfLoader</b> works by the user placing the
<tt>&quot;__DATA__&quot;</tt> token <i>after</i> perl code
which needs to be compiled and run at &rsquo;require&rsquo;
time, but <i>before</i> subroutine declarations that can be
loaded in later &minus; usually because they may never be
called.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>SelfLoader</b> will read from the
<small>FOOBAR::DATA</small> filehandle to load in the data
after <tt>&quot;__DATA__&quot;</tt>, and load in any
subroutine when it is called. The costs are the one-time
parsing of the data after <tt>&quot;__DATA__&quot;</tt>, and
a load delay for the _first_ call of any autoloaded
function. The benefits (hopefully) are a speeded up
compilation phase, with no need to load functions which are
never used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>SelfLoader</b> will stop reading from
<tt>&quot;__DATA__&quot;</tt> if it encounters the
<tt>&quot;__END__&quot;</tt> token &minus; just as you would
expect. If the <tt>&quot;__END__&quot;</tt> token is
present, and is followed by the token <small>DATA</small> ,
then the <b>SelfLoader</b> leaves the
<small>FOOBAR::DATA</small> filehandle open on the line
after that token.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>SelfLoader</b> exports the <tt>&quot;AUTOLOAD&quot;</tt>
subroutine to the package using the <b>SelfLoader</b>, and
this loads the called subroutine when it is first
called.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There is no
advantage to putting subroutines which will _always_ be
called after the <tt>&quot;__DATA__&quot;</tt> token.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Autoloading
and package lexicals</b> <br>
A &rsquo;my <tt>$pack_lexical</tt>&rsquo; statement makes
the variable <tt>$pack_lexical</tt> local _only_ to the file
up to the <tt>&quot;__DATA__&quot;</tt> token. Subroutines
declared elsewhere _cannot_ see these types of variables,
just as if you declared subroutines in the package but in
another file, they cannot see these variables.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">So
specifically, autoloaded functions cannot see package
lexicals (this applies to both the <b>SelfLoader</b> and the
Autoloader). The <tt>&quot;vars&quot;</tt> pragma provides
an alternative to defining package-level globals that will
be visible to autoloaded routines. See the documentation on
<b>vars</b> in the pragma section of perlmod.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>SelfLoader
and AutoLoader</b> <br>
The <b>SelfLoader</b> can replace the AutoLoader &minus;
just change &rsquo;use AutoLoader&rsquo; to &rsquo;use
SelfLoader&rsquo; (though note that the <b>SelfLoader</b>
exports the <small>AUTOLOAD</small> function &minus; but if
you have your own <small>AUTOLOAD</small> and are using the
AutoLoader too, you probably know what you&rsquo;re doing),
and the <tt>&quot;__END__&quot;</tt> token to
<tt>&quot;__DATA__&quot;</tt>. You will need perl version
5.001m or later to use this (version 5.001 with all patches
up to patch m).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There is no
need to inherit from the <b>SelfLoader</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>SelfLoader</b> works similarly to the AutoLoader, but
picks up the subs from after the
<tt>&quot;__DATA__&quot;</tt> instead of in the
&rsquo;lib/auto&rsquo; directory. There is a maintenance
gain in not needing to run AutoSplit on the module at
installation, and a runtime gain in not needing to keep
opening and closing files to load subs. There is a runtime
loss in needing to parse the code after the
<tt>&quot;__DATA__&quot;</tt>. Details of the
<b>AutoLoader</b> and another view of these distinctions can
be found in that module&rsquo;s documentation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>__DATA__,
__END__, and the <small>FOOBAR::DATA</small> filehandle.</b>
<br>
This section is only relevant if you want to use the
<tt>&quot;FOOBAR::DATA&quot;</tt> together with the
<b>SelfLoader</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Data after the
<tt>&quot;__DATA__&quot;</tt> token in a module is read
using the <small>FOOBAR::DATA</small> filehandle.
<tt>&quot;__END__&quot;</tt> can still be used to denote the
end of the <tt>&quot;__DATA__&quot;</tt> section if followed
by the token <small>DATA</small> &minus; this is supported
by the <b>SelfLoader</b>. The
<tt>&quot;FOOBAR::DATA&quot;</tt> filehandle is left open if
an <tt>&quot;__END__&quot;</tt> followed by a
<small>DATA</small> is found, with the filehandle positioned
at the start of the line after the
<tt>&quot;__END__&quot;</tt> token. If no
<tt>&quot;__END__&quot;</tt> token is present, or an
<tt>&quot;__END__&quot;</tt> token with no
<small>DATA</small> token on the same line, then the
filehandle is closed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>SelfLoader</b> reads from wherever the current position
of the <tt>&quot;FOOBAR::DATA&quot;</tt> filehandle is,
until the <small>EOF</small> or
<tt>&quot;__END__&quot;</tt>. This means that if you want to
use that filehandle (and <small>ONLY</small> if you want
to), you should either</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">1. Put all your
subroutine declarations immediately after the
<tt>&quot;__DATA__&quot;</tt> token and put your own data
after those declarations, using the
<tt>&quot;__END__&quot;</tt> token to mark the end of
subroutine declarations. You must also ensure that the
<b>SelfLoader</b> reads first by calling
&rsquo;SelfLoader&minus;&gt;<i>load_stubs()</i>;&rsquo;, or
by using a function which is selfloaded;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">or</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">2. You should
read the <tt>&quot;FOOBAR::DATA&quot;</tt> filehandle first,
leaving the handle open and positioned at the first line of
subroutine declarations.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You could
conceivably do both.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Classes and
inherited methods.</b> <br>
For modules which are not classes, this section is not
relevant. This section is only relevant if you have methods
which could be inherited.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A subroutine
stub (or forward declaration) looks like</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  sub stub;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">i.e. it is a
subroutine declaration without the body of the subroutine.
For modules which are not classes, there is no real need for
stubs as far as autoloading is concerned.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For modules
which <small>ARE</small> classes, and need to handle
inherited methods, stubs are needed to ensure that the
method inheritance mechanism works properly. You can load
the stubs into the module at &rsquo;require&rsquo; time, by
adding the statement
&rsquo;SelfLoader&minus;&gt;<i>load_stubs()</i>;&rsquo; to
the module to do this.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The alternative
is to put the stubs in before the
<tt>&quot;__DATA__&quot;</tt> token <small>BEFORE</small>
releasing the module, and for this purpose the
<tt>&quot;Devel::SelfStubber&quot;</tt> module is available.
However this does require the extra step of ensuring that
the stubs are in the module. If this is done I strongly
recommend that this is done <small>BEFORE</small> releasing
the module &minus; it should <small>NOT</small> be done at
install time in general.</p>

<h2>Multiple packages and fully qualified subroutine names
<a name="Multiple packages and fully qualified subroutine names"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Subroutines in
multiple packages within the same file are supported &minus;
but you should note that this requires exporting the
<tt>&quot;SelfLoader::AUTOLOAD&quot;</tt> to every package
which requires it. This is done automatically by the
<b>SelfLoader</b> when it first loads the subs into the
cache, but you should really specify it in the
initialization before the <tt>&quot;__DATA__&quot;</tt> by
putting a &rsquo;use SelfLoader&rsquo; statement in each
package.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Fully qualified
subroutine names are also supported. For example,</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">   __DATA__
   sub foo::bar {23}
   package baz;
   sub dob {32}</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">will all be
loaded correctly by the <b>SelfLoader</b>, and the
<b>SelfLoader</b> will ensure that the packages
&rsquo;foo&rsquo; and &rsquo;baz&rsquo; correctly have the
<b>SelfLoader</b> <tt>&quot;AUTOLOAD&quot;</tt> method when
the data after <tt>&quot;__DATA__&quot;</tt> is first
parsed.</p>

    resulting interpreter from executing any standard Perl script.  I
    consider linking in C subroutines in this manner to be the moral
    equivalent of defining subroutines in the Perl language itself.  You
    may sell such an object file as proprietary provided that you provide
    or offer to provide the Perl source, as specified by the GNU General

    offer to provide the Perl source as specified by the GPL.  (The
    fact that a Perl interpreter and your code are in the same binary file
    is, in this case, a form of mere aggregation.)  This is my interpretation
    of the GPL.  If you still have concerns or difficulties understanding
