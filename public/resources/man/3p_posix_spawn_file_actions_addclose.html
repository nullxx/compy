<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These functions
shall add or delete a close or open action to a spawn file
actions object.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A spawn file
actions object is of type <b>posix_spawn_file_actions_t</b>
(defined in <i>&lt;spawn.h&gt;</i>) and is used to specify a
series of actions to be performed by a <i>posix_spawn</i>()
or <i>posix_spawnp</i>() operation in order to arrive at the
set of open file descriptors for the child process given the
set of open file descriptors of the parent.
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 does not define comparison or
assignment operators for the type
<b>posix_spawn_file_actions_t</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A spawn file
actions object, when passed to <i>posix_spawn</i>() or
<i>posix_spawnp</i>(), shall specify how the set of open
file descriptors in the calling process is transformed into
a set of potentially open file descriptors for the spawned
process. This transformation shall be as if the specified
sequence of actions was performed exactly once, in the
context of the spawned process (prior to execution of the
new process image), in the order in which the actions were
added to the object; additionally, when the new process
image is executed, any file descriptor (from this new set)
which has its FD_CLOEXEC flag set shall be closed (see
<i>posix_spawn</i>()).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>posix_spawn_file_actions_addclose</i>() function shall
add a <i>close</i> action to the object referenced by
<i>file_actions</i> that shall cause the file descriptor
<i>fildes</i> to be closed (as if <i>close</i>(
<i>fildes</i>) had been called) when a new process is
spawned using this file actions object.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>posix_spawn_file_actions_addopen</i>() function shall add
an <i>open</i> action to the object referenced by
<i>file_actions</i> that shall cause the file named by
<i>path</i> to be opened (as if <i>open</i>( <i>path</i>,
<i>oflag</i>, <i>mode</i>) had been called, and the returned
file descriptor, if not <i>fildes</i>, had been changed to
<i>fildes</i>) when a new process is spawned using this file
actions object. If <i>fildes</i> was already an open file
descriptor, it shall be closed before the new file is
opened.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The string
described by <i>path</i> shall be copied by the
<i>posix_spawn_file_actions_addopen</i>() function.</p>

<h2>RETURN VALUE

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Upon successful
completion, these functions shall return zero; otherwise, an
error number shall be returned to indicate the error.</p>

<h2>ERRORS

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These functions

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It shall not be

associated file actions object is later used during a
<i>posix_spawn</i>() or <i>posix_spawnp</i>() operation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>The
following sections are informative.</i></p>

<h2>EXAMPLES
<a name="EXAMPLES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">None.</p>

<h2>APPLICATION USAGE
<a name="APPLICATION USAGE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These functions
are part of the Spawn option and need not be provided on all
implementations.</p>

<h2>RATIONALE
<a name="RATIONALE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A spawn file
actions object may be initialized to contain an ordered
sequence of <i>close</i>(), <i>dup2</i>(), and <i>open</i>()
operations to be used by <i>posix_spawn</i>() or
<i>posix_spawnp</i>() to arrive at the set of open file
descriptors inherited by the spawned process from the set of
open file descriptors in the parent at the time of the
<i>posix_spawn</i>() or <i>posix_spawnp</i>() call. It had
been suggested that the <i>close</i>() and <i>dup2</i>()
operations alone are sufficient to rearrange file
descriptors, and that files which need to be opened for use
by the spawned process can be handled either by having the
calling process open them before the <i>posix_spawn</i>() or
<i>posix_spawnp</i>() call (and close them after), or by
passing filenames to the spawned process (in <i>argv</i>) so
that it may open them itself. The standard developers
recommend that applications use one of these two methods
when practical, since detailed error status on a failed open
operation is always available to the application this way.
However, the standard developers feel that allowing a spawn
file actions object to specify open operations is still
appropriate because:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="12%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">1.</p></td>
<td width="2%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">It is consistent with equivalent
POSIX.5 (Ada) functionality.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="12%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p>2.</p></td>
<td width="2%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>It supports the I/O redirection paradigm commonly
employed by POSIX programs designed to be invoked from a
shell. When such a program is the child process, it may not
be designed to open files on its own.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="12%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p>3.</p></td>
<td width="2%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>It allows file opens that might otherwise fail or
violate file ownership/access rights if executed by the
parent process.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Regarding 2.
above, note that the spawn open file action provides to
<i>posix_spawn</i>() and <i>posix_spawnp</i>() the same
capability that the shell redirection operators provide to
<i>system</i>(), only without the intervening execution of a
shell; for example:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>system
(&quot;myprog &lt;file1 3&lt;file2&quot;);</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Regarding 3.
above, note that if the calling process needs to open one or
more files for access by the spawned process, but has
insufficient spare file descriptors, then the open action is
necessary to allow the <i>open</i>() to occur in the context
of the child process after other file descriptors have been
closed (that must remain open in the parent).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Additionally,
if a parent is executed from a file having a
&quot;set-user-id&quot; mode bit set and the
POSIX_SPAWN_RESETIDS flag is set in the spawn attributes, a
file created within the parent process will (possibly
incorrectly) have the parent&rsquo;s effective user ID as
its owner, whereas a file created via an <i>open</i>()
action during <i>posix_spawn</i>() or <i>posix_spawnp</i>()
will have the parent&rsquo;s real ID as its owner; and an
open by the parent process may successfully open a file to
which the real user should not have access or fail to open a
file to which the real user should have access.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>File
Descriptor Mapping</b> <br>
The standard developers had originally proposed using an
array which specified the mapping of child file descriptors
back to those of the parent. It was pointed out by the
ballot group that it is not possible to reshuffle file
descriptors arbitrarily in a library implementation of
<i>posix_spawn</i>() or <i>posix_spawnp</i>() without
provision for one or more spare file descriptor entries
(which simply may not be available). Such an array requires
that an implementation develop a complex strategy to achieve
the desired mapping without inadvertently closing the wrong
file descriptor at the wrong time.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It was noted by
a member of the Ada Language Bindings working group that the
approved Ada Language <i>Start_Process</i> family of POSIX
process primitives use a caller-specified set of file
actions to alter the normal <i>fork</i>()/ <i>exec</i>
semantics for inheritance of file descriptors in a very
flexible way, yet no such problems exist because the burden
of determining how to achieve the final file descriptor
mapping is completely on the application. Furthermore,
although the file actions interface appears frightening at
first glance, it is actually quite simple to implement in
either a library or the kernel.</p>
