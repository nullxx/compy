&minus; preparing a new module for distribution</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This document
gives you some suggestions about how to go about writing
Perl modules, preparing them for distribution, and making
them available via <small>CPAN</small> .</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">One of the
things that makes Perl really powerful is the fact that Perl
hackers tend to want to share the solutions to problems
they&rsquo;ve faced, so you and I don&rsquo;t have to battle
with the same problem again.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The main way
they do this is by abstracting the solution into a Perl
module. If you don&rsquo;t know what one of these is, the
rest of this document isn&rsquo;t going to be much use to
you. You&rsquo;re also missing out on an awful lot of useful
code; consider having a look at perlmod, perlmodlib and
perlmodinstall before coming back here.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When
you&rsquo;ve found that there isn&rsquo;t a module available
for what you&rsquo;re trying to do, and you&rsquo;ve had to
write the code yourself, consider packaging up the solution
into a module and uploading it to <small>CPAN</small> so
that others can benefit.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Warning</b>
<br>
We&rsquo;re going to primarily concentrate on Perl-only
modules here, rather than <small>XS</small> modules.
<small>XS</small> modules serve a rather different purpose,
and you should consider different things before distributing
them &minus; the popularity of the library you are gluing,
the portability to other operating systems, and so on.
However, the notes on preparing the Perl side of the module
and packaging and distributing it will apply equally well to
an <small>XS</small> module as a pure-Perl one.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>What should
I make into a module?</b> <br>
You should make a module out of any code that you think is
going to be useful to others. Anything that&rsquo;s likely
to fill a hole in the communal library and which someone
else can slot directly into their program. Any part of your
code which you can isolate and extract and plug into
something else is a likely candidate.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Let&rsquo;s
take an example. Suppose you&rsquo;re reading in data from a
local format into a hash-of-hashes in Perl, turning that
into a tree, walking the tree and then piping each node to
an Acme Transmogrifier Server.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Now, quite a
few people have the Acme Transmogrifier, and you&rsquo;ve
had to write something to talk the protocol from scratch
&minus; you&rsquo;d almost certainly want to make that into
a module. The level at which you pitch it is up to you: you
might want protocol-level modules analogous to Net::SMTP
which then talk to higher level modules analogous to
Mail::Send. The choice is yours, but you do want to get a
module out for that server protocol.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Nobody else on
the planet is going to talk your local data format, so we
can ignore that. But what about the thing in the middle?
Building tree structures from Perl variables and then
traversing them is a nice, general problem, and if
nobody&rsquo;s already written a module that does that, you
might want to modularise that code too.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">So hopefully
you&rsquo;ve now got a few ideas about what&rsquo;s good to
modularise. Let&rsquo;s now see how it&rsquo;s done.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Step-by-step:
Preparing the ground</b> <br>
Before we even start scraping out the code, there are a few
things we&rsquo;ll want to do in advance. <br>
Look around</p>

<p style="margin-left:15%;">Dig into a bunch of modules to
see how they&rsquo;re written. I&rsquo;d suggest starting
with Text::Tabs, since it&rsquo;s in the standard library
and is nice and simple, and then looking at something a
little more complex like File::Copy. For object oriented
code, <tt>&quot;WWW::Mechanize&quot;</tt> or the
<tt>&quot;Email::*&quot;</tt> modules provide some good
examples.</p>

<p style="margin-left:15%; margin-top: 1em">These should
give you an overall feel for how modules are laid out and
written.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Check it&rsquo;s new</p>

<p style="margin-left:15%;">There are a lot of modules on
<small>CPAN</small> , and it&rsquo;s easy to miss one
that&rsquo;s similar to what you&rsquo;re planning on
contributing. Have a good plough through the
&lt;http://search.cpan.org&gt; and make sure you&rsquo;re
not the one reinventing the wheel!</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Discuss the need</p>

<p style="margin-left:15%;">You might love it. You might
feel that everyone else needs it. But there might not
actually be any real demand for it out there. If
you&rsquo;re unsure about the demand your module will have,
consider sending out feelers on the
<tt>&quot;comp.lang.perl.modules&quot;</tt> newsgroup, or as
a last resort, ask the modules list at
<tt>&quot;modules@perl.org&quot;</tt>. Remember that this is
a closed list with a very long turn-around time &minus; be
prepared to wait a good while for a response from them.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Choose a name</p>

<p style="margin-left:15%;">Perl modules included on
<small>CPAN</small> have a naming hierarchy you should try
to fit in with. See perlmodlib for more details on how this
works, and browse around <small>CPAN</small> and the modules
list to get a feel of it. At the very least, remember this:
modules should be title capitalised, (This::Thing) fit in
with a category, and explain their purpose succinctly.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Check again</p>

<p style="margin-left:15%;">While you&rsquo;re doing that,
make really sure you haven&rsquo;t missed a module similar
to the one you&rsquo;re about to write.</p>

<p style="margin-left:15%; margin-top: 1em">When
you&rsquo;ve got your name sorted out and you&rsquo;re sure
that your module is wanted and not currently available,
it&rsquo;s time to start coding.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Step-by-step:
Making the module</b> <br>
Start with <i>module-starter</i> or <i>h2xs</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:15%;">The <i>module-starter</i>
utility is distributed as part of the Module::Starter
<small>CPAN</small> package. It creates a directory with
stubs of all the necessary files to start a new module,
according to recent &quot;best practice&quot; for module
development, and is invoked from the command line, thus:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:15%; margin-top: 1em">    module&minus;starter &minus;&minus;module=Foo::Bar \
       &minus;&minus;author=&quot;Your Name&quot; &minus;&minus;email=yourname@cpan.org</pre>


<p style="margin-left:15%; margin-top: 1em">If you do not
wish to install the Module::Starter package from
<small>CPAN</small> , <i>h2xs</i> is an older tool,
originally intended for the development of <small>XS</small>
modules, which comes packaged with the Perl
distribution.</p>

<p style="margin-left:15%; margin-top: 1em">A typical
invocation of h2xs for a pure Perl module is:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:15%; margin-top: 1em">    h2xs &minus;AX &minus;&minus;skip&minus;exporter &minus;&minus;use&minus;new&minus;tests &minus;n Foo::Bar</pre>


<p style="margin-left:15%; margin-top: 1em">The
<tt>&quot;&minus;A&quot;</tt> omits the Autoloader code,
<tt>&quot;&minus;X&quot;</tt> omits <small>XS</small>
elements,
<tt>&quot;&minus;&minus;skip&minus;exporter&quot;</tt> omits
the Exporter code,
<tt>&quot;&minus;&minus;use&minus;new&minus;tests&quot;</tt>
sets up a modern testing environment, and
<tt>&quot;&minus;n&quot;</tt> specifies the name of the
module.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Use strict and warnings</p>

<p style="margin-left:15%;">A module&rsquo;s code has to be
warning and strict-clean, since you can&rsquo;t guarantee
the conditions that it&rsquo;ll be used under. Besides, you
wouldn&rsquo;t want to distribute code that wasn&rsquo;t
warning or strict-clean anyway, right?</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Use Carp</p>

<p style="margin-left:15%;">The Carp module allows you to
present your error messages from the caller&rsquo;s
perspective; this gives you a way to signal a problem with
the caller and not your module. For instance, if you say
this:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:15%; margin-top: 1em">    warn &quot;No hostname given&quot;;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:15%; margin-top: 1em">the user will
see something like this:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:15%; margin-top: 1em">    No hostname given at /usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.6.0/Net/Acme.pm
    line 123.</pre>


<p style="margin-left:15%; margin-top: 1em">which looks
like your module is doing something wrong. Instead, you want
to put the blame on the user, and say this:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:15%; margin-top: 1em">    No hostname given at bad_code, line 10.</pre>


<p style="margin-left:15%; margin-top: 1em">You do this by
using Carp and replacing your <tt>&quot;warn&quot;</tt>s
with <tt>&quot;carp&quot;</tt>s. If you need to
<tt>&quot;die&quot;</tt>, say <tt>&quot;croak&quot;</tt>
instead. However, keep <tt>&quot;warn&quot;</tt> and
<tt>&quot;die&quot;</tt> in place for your sanity checks
&minus; where it really is your module at fault.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Use Exporter &minus;
wisely!</p>

<p style="margin-left:15%;">Exporter gives you a standard
way of exporting symbols and subroutines from your module
into the caller&rsquo;s namespace. For instance, saying
<tt>&quot;use Net::Acme qw(&amp;frob)&quot;</tt> would
import the <tt>&quot;frob&quot;</tt> subroutine.</p>

<p style="margin-left:15%; margin-top: 1em">The package
variable <tt>@EXPORT</tt> will determine which symbols will
get exported when the caller simply says <tt>&quot;use
Net::Acme&quot;</tt> &minus; you will hardly ever want to
put anything in there. <tt>@EXPORT_OK</tt>, on the other
hand, specifies which symbols you&rsquo;re willing to
export. If you do want to export a bunch of symbols, use the
<tt>%EXPORT_TAGS</tt> and define a standard export set
&minus; look at Exporter for more details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Use plain old documentation</p>

<p style="margin-left:15%;">The work isn&rsquo;t over until
the paperwork is done, and you&rsquo;re going to need to put
in some time writing some documentation for your module.
<tt>&quot;module&minus;starter&quot;</tt> or
<tt>&quot;h2xs&quot;</tt> will provide a stub for you to
fill in; if you&rsquo;re not sure about the format, look at
perlpod for an introduction. Provide a good synopsis of how
your module is used in code, a description, and then notes
on the syntax and function of the individual subroutines or
methods. Use Perl comments for developer notes and
<small>POD</small> for end-user notes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Write tests</p>

<p style="margin-left:15%;">You&rsquo;re encouraged to
create self-tests for your module to ensure it&rsquo;s
working as intended on the myriad platforms Perl supports;
if you upload your module to <small>CPAN</small> , a host of
testers will build your module and send you the results of
the tests. Again, <tt>&quot;module&minus;starter&quot;</tt>
and <tt>&quot;h2xs&quot;</tt> provide a test framework which
you can extend &minus; you should do something more than
just checking your module will compile. Test::Simple and
Test::More are good places to start when writing a test
suite.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Write the
<small>README</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:15%;">If you&rsquo;re uploading to
<small>CPAN</small> , the automated gremlins will extract
the <small>README</small> file and place that in your
<small>CPAN</small> directory. It&rsquo;ll also appear in
the main <i>by-module</i> and <i>by-category</i> directories
if you make it onto the modules list. It&rsquo;s a good idea
to put here what the module actually does in detail, and the
user-visible changes since the last release.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Step-by-step:
Distributing your module</b> <br>
Get a <small>CPAN</small> user <small>ID</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:15%;">Every developer publishing
modules on <small>CPAN</small> needs a <small>CPAN
ID</small> . Visit
<tt>&quot;http://pause.perl.org/&quot;</tt>, select
&quot;Request <small>PAUSE</small> Account&quot;, and wait
for your request to be approved by the <small>PAUSE</small>
administrators.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot;perl Makefile.PL; make
test; make dist&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:15%;">Once again,
<tt>&quot;module&minus;starter&quot;</tt> or
<tt>&quot;h2xs&quot;</tt> has done all the work for you.
They produce the standard <tt>&quot;Makefile.PL&quot;</tt>
you see when you download and install modules, and this
produces a Makefile with a <tt>&quot;dist&quot;</tt>
target.</p>

<p style="margin-left:15%; margin-top: 1em">Once
you&rsquo;ve ensured that your module passes its own tests
&minus; always a good thing to make sure &minus; you can
<tt>&quot;make dist&quot;</tt>, and the Makefile will
hopefully produce you a nice tarball of your module, ready
for upload.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Upload the tarball</p>

<p style="margin-left:15%;">The email you got when you
received your <small>CPAN ID</small> will tell you how to
log in to <small>PAUSE</small> , the Perl Authors Upload
SErver. From the menus there, you can upload your module to
<small>CPAN</small> .</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Announce to the modules
list</p>

<p style="margin-left:15%;">Once uploaded, it&rsquo;ll sit
unnoticed in your author directory. If you want it connected
to the rest of the <small>CPAN</small> , you&rsquo;ll need
to go to &quot;Register Namespace&quot; on
<small>PAUSE</small> . Once registered, your module will
appear in the by-module and by-category listings on
<small>CPAN</small> .</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Announce to clpa</p>

<p style="margin-left:15%;">If you have a burning desire to
tell the world about your release, post an announcement to
the moderated <tt>&quot;comp.lang.perl.announce&quot;</tt>
newsgroup.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Fix bugs!</p>

<p style="margin-left:15%;">Once you start accumulating
users, they&rsquo;ll send you bug reports. If you&rsquo;re
lucky, they&rsquo;ll even send you patches. Welcome to the
joys of maintaining a software project...</p>
