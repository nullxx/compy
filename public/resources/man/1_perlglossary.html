&minus; Perl Glossary</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A glossary of
terms (technical and otherwise) used in the Perl
documentation. Other useful sources include the Free On-Line
Dictionary of Computing &lt;http://foldoc.org/&gt;, the
Jargon File &lt;http://catb.org/~esr/jargon/&gt;, and
Wikipedia &lt;http://www.wikipedia.org/&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>A</b> <br>
accessor methods</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A &quot;method&quot; used to
indirectly inspect or update an &quot;object&quot;&rsquo;s
state (its instance variables).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">actual arguments</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The scalar values that you
supply to a &quot;function&quot; or &quot;subroutine&quot;
when you call it. For instance, when you call
<tt>&quot;power(&quot;puff&quot;)&quot;</tt>, the string
<tt>&quot;puff&quot;</tt> is the actual argument. See also
&quot;argument&quot; and &quot;formal arguments&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">address operator</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Some languages work directly
with the memory addresses of values, but this can be like
playing with fire. Perl provides a set of asbestos gloves
for handling all memory management. The closest to an
address operator in Perl is the backslash operator, but it
gives you a &quot;hard reference&quot;, which is much safer
than a memory address.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">algorithm</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A well-defined sequence of
steps, clearly enough explained that even a computer could
do them.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">alias</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A nickname for something, which
behaves in all ways as though you&rsquo;d used the original
name instead of the nickname. Temporary aliases are
implicitly created in the loop variable for
<tt>&quot;foreach&quot;</tt> loops, in the <tt>$_</tt>
variable for map or grep operators, in <tt>$a</tt> and
<tt>$b</tt> during sort&rsquo;s comparison function, and in
each element of <tt>@_</tt> for the &quot;actual
arguments&quot; of a subroutine call. Permanent aliases are
explicitly created in packages by importing symbols or by
assignment to typeglobs. Lexically scoped aliases for
package variables are explicitly created by the our
declaration.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">alternatives</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A list of possible choices from
which you may select only one, as in &quot;Would you like
door A, B, or C?&quot; Alternatives in regular expressions
are separated with a single vertical bar:
<tt>&quot;|&quot;</tt>. Alternatives in normal Perl
expressions are separated with a double vertical bar:
<tt>&quot;||&quot;</tt>. Logical alternatives in
&quot;Boolean&quot; expressions are separated with either
<tt>&quot;||&quot;</tt> or <tt>&quot;or&quot;</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">anonymous</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Used to describe a
&quot;referent&quot; that is not directly accessible through
a named &quot;variable&quot;. Such a referent must be
indirectly accessible through at least one &quot;hard
reference&quot;. When the last hard reference goes away, the
anonymous referent is destroyed without pity.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">architecture</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The kind of computer
you&rsquo;re working on, where one &quot;kind&quot; of
computer means all those computers sharing a compatible
machine language. Since Perl programs are (typically) simple
text files, not executable images, a Perl program is much
less sensitive to the architecture it&rsquo;s running on
than programs in other languages, such as C, that are
compiled into machine code. See also &quot;platform&quot;
and &quot;operating system&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">argument</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A piece of data supplied to a
program, &quot;subroutine&quot;, &quot;function&quot;, or
&quot;method&quot; to tell it what it&rsquo;s supposed to
do. Also called a &quot;parameter&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><small>ARGV</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The name of the array
containing the &quot;argument&quot; &quot;vector&quot; from
the command line. If you use the empty
<tt>&quot;&lt;&gt;&quot;</tt> operator, &quot;
<small>ARGV</small> &quot; is the name of both the
&quot;filehandle&quot; used to traverse the arguments and
the &quot;scalar&quot; containing the name of the current
input file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">arithmetical operator</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A &quot;symbol&quot; such as
<tt>&quot;+&quot;</tt> or <tt>&quot;/&quot;</tt> that tells
Perl to do the arithmetic you were supposed to learn in
grade school.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">array</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">An ordered sequence of values,
stored such that you can easily access any of the values
using an integer &quot;subscript&quot; that specifies the
value&rsquo;s &quot;offset&quot; in the sequence.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">array context</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">An archaic expression for what
is more correctly referred to as &quot;list
context&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><small>ASCII</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The American Standard Code for
Information Interchange (a 7&minus;bit character set
adequate only for poorly representing English text). Often
used loosely to describe the lowest 128 values of the
various <small>ISO&minus;8859&minus;X</small> character
sets, a bunch of mutually incompatible 8&minus;bit codes
sometimes described as half <small>ASCII</small> . See also
&quot;Unicode&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">assertion</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A component of a &quot;regular
expression&quot; that must be true for the pattern to match
but does not necessarily match any characters itself. Often
used specifically to mean a &quot;zero width&quot;
assertion.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">assignment</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">An &quot;operator&quot; whose
assigned mission in life is to change the value of a
&quot;variable&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">assignment operator</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Either a regular
&quot;assignment&quot;, or a compound &quot;operator&quot;
composed of an ordinary assignment and some other operator,
that changes the value of a variable in place, that is,
relative to its old value. For example, <tt>&quot;$a +=
2&quot;</tt> adds <tt>2</tt> to <tt>$a</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">associative array</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">See &quot;hash&quot;.
Please.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">associativity</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Determines whether you do the
left &quot;operator&quot; first or the right
&quot;operator&quot; first when you have &quot;A
&quot;operator&quot; B &quot;operator&quot; C&quot; and the
two operators are of the same precedence. Operators like
<tt>&quot;+&quot;</tt> are left associative, while operators
like <tt>&quot;**&quot;</tt> are right associative. See
perlop for a list of operators and their associativity.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">asynchronous</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Said of events or activities
whose relative temporal ordering is indeterminate because
too many things are going on at once. Hence, an asynchronous
event is one you didn&rsquo;t know when to expect.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">atom</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A &quot;regular
expression&quot; component potentially matching a
&quot;substring&quot; containing one or more characters and
treated as an indivisible syntactic unit by any following
&quot;quantifier&quot;. (Contrast with an
&quot;assertion&quot; that matches something of &quot;zero
width&quot; and may not be quantified.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">atomic operation</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When Democritus gave the word
&quot;atom&quot; to the indivisible bits of matter, he meant
literally something that could not be cut: <i>a&minus;</i>
(not) + <i>tomos</i> (cuttable). An atomic operation is an
action that can&rsquo;t be interrupted, not one forbidden in
a nuclear-free zone.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">attribute</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A new feature that allows the
declaration of variables and subroutines with modifiers as
in <tt>&quot;sub foo : locked method&quot;</tt>. Also,
another name for an &quot;instance variable&quot; of an
&quot;object&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">autogeneration</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A feature of &quot;operator
overloading&quot; of objects, whereby the behavior of
certain operators can be reasonably deduced using more
fundamental operators. This assumes that the overloaded
operators will often have the same relationships as the
regular operators. See perlop.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">autoincrement</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">To add one to something
automatically, hence the name of the <tt>&quot;++&quot;</tt>
operator. To instead subtract one from something
automatically is known as an &quot;autodecrement&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">autoload</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">To load on demand. (Also called
&quot;lazy&quot; loading.) Specifically, to call an
<small>AUTOLOAD</small> subroutine on behalf of an undefined
subroutine.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">autosplit</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">To split a string
automatically, as the <b>&minus;a</b> &quot;switch&quot;
does when running under <b>&minus;p</b> or <b>&minus;n</b>
in order to emulate &quot;awk&quot;. (See also the AutoSplit
module, which has nothing to do with the <b>&minus;a</b>
switch, but a lot to do with autoloading.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">autovivification</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A Greco-Roman word meaning
&quot;to bring oneself to life&quot;. In Perl, storage
locations (lvalues) spontaneously generate themselves as
needed, including the creation of any &quot;hard
reference&quot; values to point to the next level of
storage. The assignment <tt>&quot;$a[5][5][5][5][5] =
&quot;quintet&quot;&quot;</tt> potentially creates five
scalar storage locations, plus four references (in the first
four scalar locations) pointing to four new anonymous arrays
(to hold the last four scalar locations). But the point of
autovivification is that you don&rsquo;t have to worry about
it.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="4%">


<p><small>AV</small></p></td>
<td width="2%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>Short for &quot;array value&quot;, which refers to one
of Perl&rsquo;s internal data types that holds an
&quot;array&quot;. The &quot; <small>AV</small> &quot; type
is a subclass of &quot; <small>SV</small> &quot;.</p></td></tr>

Also coincidentally refers to a venerable text-processing
language from which Perl derived some of its high-level
ideas.</p> </td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>B</b> <br>
backreference</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A substring captured by a
subpattern within unadorned parentheses in a
&quot;regex&quot;, also referred to as a capture group. The
sequences (<tt>&quot;\g1&quot;</tt>,
<tt>&quot;\g2&quot;</tt>, etc.) later in the same pattern
refer back to the corresponding subpattern in the current
match. Outside the pattern, the numbered variables
(<tt>$1</tt>, <tt>$2</tt>, etc.) continue to refer to these
same values, as long as the pattern was the last successful
match of the current dynamic scope.
<tt>&quot;\g{&minus;1}&quot;</tt> can be used to refer to a
group by relative rather than absolute position; and groups
can be also be named, and referred to later by name rather
than number. See &quot;Capture groups&quot; in perlre.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">backtracking</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The practice of saying,
&quot;If I had to do it all over, I&rsquo;d do it
differently,&quot; and then actually going back and doing it
all over differently. Mathematically speaking, it&rsquo;s
returning from an unsuccessful recursion on a tree of
possibilities. Perl backtracks when it attempts to match
patterns with a &quot;regular expression&quot;, and its
earlier attempts don&rsquo;t pan out. See
&quot;Backtracking&quot; in perlre.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">backward compatibility</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Means you can still run your
old program because we didn&rsquo;t break any of the
features or bugs it was relying on.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">bareword</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A word sufficiently ambiguous
to be deemed illegal under use strict &rsquo;subs&rsquo;. In
the absence of that stricture, a bareword is treated as if
quotes were around it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">base class</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A generic &quot;object&quot;
type; that is, a &quot;class&quot; from which other, more
specific classes are derived genetically by
&quot;inheritance&quot;. Also called a
&quot;superclass&quot; by people who respect their
ancestors.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">big-endian</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">From Swift: someone who eats
eggs big end first. Also used of computers that store the
most significant &quot;byte&quot; of a word at a lower byte
address than the least significant byte. Often considered
superior to little-endian machines. See also
&quot;little-endian&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">binary</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Having to do with numbers
represented in base 2. That means there&rsquo;s basically
two numbers, 0 and 1. Also used to describe a &quot;non-text
file&quot;, presumably because such a file makes full use of
all the binary bits in its bytes. With the advent of
&quot;Unicode&quot;, this distinction, already suspect,
loses even more of its meaning.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">binary operator</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">An &quot;operator&quot; that
takes two operands.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">bind</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">To assign a specific
&quot;network address&quot; to a &quot;socket&quot;.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="4%">


<p>bit</p></td>
<td width="2%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>An integer in the range from 0 to 1, inclusive. The
smallest possible unit of information storage. An eighth of
a &quot;byte&quot; or of a dollar. (The term &quot;Pieces of
Eight&quot; comes from being able to split the old Spanish
dollar into 8 bits, each of which still counted for money.
That&rsquo;s why a 25&minus;cent piece today is still
&quot;two bits&quot;.)</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">bit shift</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The movement of bits left or
right in a computer word, which has the effect of
multiplying or dividing by a power of 2.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">bit string</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A sequence of bits that is
actually being thought of as a sequence of bits, for
once.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">bless</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">In corporate life, to grant
official approval to a thing, as in, &quot;The
<small>VP</small> of Engineering has blessed our WebCruncher
project.&quot; Similarly in Perl, to grant official approval
to a &quot;referent&quot; so that it can function as an
&quot;object&quot;, such as a WebCruncher object. See
&quot;bless&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">block</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">What a &quot;process&quot; does
when it has to wait for something: &quot;My process blocked
waiting for the disk.&quot; As an unrelated noun, it refers
to a large chunk of data, of a size that the &quot;operating
system&quot; likes to deal with (normally a power of two
such as 512 or 8192). Typically refers to a chunk of data
that&rsquo;s coming from or going to a disk file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><small>BLOCK</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A syntactic construct
consisting of a sequence of Perl statements that is
delimited by braces. The <tt>&quot;if&quot;</tt> and
<tt>&quot;while&quot;</tt> statements are defined in terms
of BLOCKs, for instance. Sometimes we also say
&quot;block&quot; to mean a lexical scope; that is, a
sequence of statements that act like a &quot;
<small>BLOCK</small> &quot;, such as within an eval or a
file, even though the statements aren&rsquo;t delimited by
braces.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">block buffering</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A method of making input and
output efficient by passing one &quot;block&quot; at a time.
By default, Perl does block buffering to disk files. See
&quot;buffer&quot; and &quot;command buffering&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Boolean</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A value that is either
&quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Boolean context</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A special kind of &quot;scalar
context&quot; used in conditionals to decide whether the
&quot;scalar value&quot; returned by an expression is
&quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot;. Does not evaluate as
either a string or a number. See &quot;context&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">breakpoint</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A spot in your program where
you&rsquo;ve told the debugger to stop execution so you can
poke around and see whether anything is wrong yet.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">broadcast</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">To send a &quot;datagram&quot;
to multiple destinations simultaneously.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="4%">


<p><small>BSD</small></p></td>
<td width="2%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>A psychoactive drug, popular in the 80s, probably
developed at U. C. Berkeley or thereabouts. Similar in many
ways to the prescription-only medication called &quot;System
V&quot;, but infinitely more useful. (Or, at least, more
fun.) The full chemical name is &quot;Berkeley Standard
Distribution&quot;.</p> </td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">bucket</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A location in a &quot;hash
table&quot; containing (potentially) multiple entries whose
keys &quot;hash&quot; to the same hash value according to
its hash function. (As internal policy, you don&rsquo;t have
to worry about it, unless you&rsquo;re into internals, or
policy.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">buffer</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A temporary holding location
for data. Block buffering means that the data is passed on
to its destination whenever the buffer is full. Line
buffering means that it&rsquo;s passed on whenever a
complete line is received. Command buffering means that
it&rsquo;s passed every time you do a print command (or
equivalent). If your output is unbuffered, the system
processes it one byte at a time without the use of a holding
area. This can be rather inefficient.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">built-in</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A &quot;function&quot; that is
predefined in the language. Even when hidden by
&quot;overriding&quot;, you can always get at a built-in
function by qualifying its name with the
<tt>&quot;CORE::&quot;</tt> pseudo-package.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">bundle</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A group of related modules on
&quot; <small>CPAN</small> &quot;. (Also, sometimes refers
to a group of command-line switches grouped into one
&quot;switch cluster&quot;.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">byte</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A piece of data worth eight
bits in most places.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">bytecode</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A pidgin-like language spoken
among &rsquo;droids when they don&rsquo;t wish to reveal
their orientation (see &quot;endian&quot;). Named after some
similar languages spoken (for similar reasons) between
compilers and interpreters in the late 20th century. These
languages are characterized by representing everything as a
non-architecture-dependent sequence of bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>C</b></p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>C</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>A language beloved by many for its inside-out
&quot;type&quot; definitions, inscrutable
&quot;precedence&quot; rules, and heavy
&quot;overloading&quot; of the function-call mechanism.
(Well, actually, people first switched to C because they
found lowercase identifiers easier to read than upper.) Perl
is written in C, so it&rsquo;s not surprising that Perl
borrowed a few ideas from it.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">C preprocessor</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The typical C compiler&rsquo;s
first pass, which processes lines beginning with
<tt>&quot;#&quot;</tt> for conditional compilation and macro
definition and does various manipulations of the program
text based on the current definitions. Also known as
<i>cpp</i>(1).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">call by reference</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">An
&quot;argument&quot;&minus;passing mechanism in which the
&quot;formal arguments&quot; refer directly to the
&quot;actual arguments&quot;, and the &quot;subroutine&quot;
can change the actual arguments by changing the formal
arguments. That is, the formal argument is an
&quot;alias&quot; for the actual argument. See also
&quot;call by value&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">call by value</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">An
&quot;argument&quot;&minus;passing mechanism in which the
&quot;formal arguments&quot; refer to a copy of the
&quot;actual arguments&quot;, and the &quot;subroutine&quot;
cannot change the actual arguments by changing the formal
arguments. See also &quot;call by reference&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">callback</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A &quot;handler&quot; that you
register with some other part of your program in the hope
that the other part of your program will &quot;trigger&quot;
your handler when some event of interest transpires.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">canonical</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Reduced to a standard form to
facilitate comparison.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">capture buffer, capture
group</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">These two terms are synonymous:
a captured substring by a regex subpattern.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">capturing</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The use of parentheses around a
&quot;subpattern&quot; in a &quot;regular expression&quot;
to store the matched &quot;substring&quot; as a
&quot;backreference&quot; or capture group. (Captured
strings are also returned as a list in &quot;list
context&quot;.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">character</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A small integer representative
of a unit of orthography. Historically, characters were
usually stored as fixed-width integers (typically in a byte,
or maybe two, depending on the character set), but with the
advent of <small>UTF&minus;8</small> , characters are often
stored in a variable number of bytes depending on the size
of the integer that represents the character. Perl manages
this transparently for you, for the most part.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">character class</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A square-bracketed list of
characters used in a &quot;regular expression&quot; to
indicate that any character of the set may occur at a given
point. Loosely, any predefined set of characters so
used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">character property</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A predefined &quot;character
class&quot; matchable by the <tt>&quot;\p&quot;</tt>
&quot;metasymbol&quot;. Many standard properties are defined
for &quot;Unicode&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">circumfix operator</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">An &quot;operator&quot; that
surrounds its &quot;operand&quot;, like the angle operator,
or parentheses, or a hug.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">class</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A user-defined
&quot;type&quot;, implemented in Perl via a
&quot;package&quot; that provides (either directly or by
inheritance) methods (that is, subroutines) to handle
instances of the class (its objects). See also
&quot;inheritance&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">class method</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A &quot;method&quot; whose
&quot;invocant&quot; is a &quot;package&quot; name, not an
&quot;object&quot; reference. A method associated with the
class as a whole.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">client</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">In networking, a
&quot;process&quot; that initiates contact with a
&quot;server&quot; process in order to exchange data and
perhaps receive a service.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">cloister</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A &quot;cluster&quot; used to
restrict the scope of a &quot;regular expression
modifier&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">closure</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">An &quot;anonymous&quot;
subroutine that, when a reference to it is generated at run
time, keeps track of the identities of externally visible
lexical variables even after those lexical variables have
supposedly gone out of &quot;scope&quot;. They&rsquo;re
called &quot;closures&quot; because this sort of behavior
gives mathematicians a sense of closure.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">cluster</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A parenthesized
&quot;subpattern&quot; used to group parts of a
&quot;regular expression&quot; into a single
&quot;atom&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><small>CODE</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The word returned by the ref
function when you apply it to a reference to a subroutine.
See also &quot; <small>CV</small> &quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">code generator</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A system that writes code for
you in a low-level language, such as code to implement the
backend of a compiler. See &quot;program
generator&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">code point</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The position of a character in
a character set encoding. The character
<tt>&quot;NULL&quot;</tt> is almost certainly at the zeroth
position in all character sets, so its code point is 0. The
code point for the <tt>&quot;SPACE&quot;</tt> character in
the <small>ASCII</small> character set is 0x20, or 32
decimal; in <small>EBCDIC</small> it is 0x40, or 64 decimal.
The ord function returns the code point of a character.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;code
position&quot; and &quot;ordinal&quot; mean the same thing
as &quot;code point&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">code subpattern</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A &quot;regular
expression&quot; subpattern whose real purpose is to execute
some Perl code, for example, the
<tt>&quot;(?{...})&quot;</tt> and
<tt>&quot;(??{...})&quot;</tt> subpatterns.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">collating sequence</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The order into which characters
sort. This is used by &quot;string&quot; comparison routines
to decide, for example, where in this glossary to put
&quot;collating sequence&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">command</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">In &quot;shell&quot;
programming, the syntactic combination of a program name and
its arguments. More loosely, anything you type to a shell (a
command interpreter) that starts it doing something. Even
more loosely, a Perl &quot;statement&quot;, which might
start with a &quot;label&quot; and typically ends with a
semicolon.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">command buffering</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A mechanism in Perl that lets
you store up the output of each Perl &quot;command&quot; and
then flush it out as a single request to the &quot;operating
system&quot;. It&rsquo;s enabled by setting the <tt>$|</tt>
(<tt>$AUTOFLUSH</tt>) variable to a true value. It&rsquo;s
used when you don&rsquo;t want data sitting around not going
where it&rsquo;s supposed to, which may happen because the
default on a &quot;file&quot; or &quot;pipe&quot; is to use
&quot;block buffering&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">command name</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The name of the program
currently executing, as typed on the command line. In C, the
&quot;command&quot; name is passed to the program as the
first command-line argument. In Perl, it comes in separately
as <tt>$0</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">command-line arguments</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The values you supply along
with a program name when you tell a &quot;shell&quot; to
execute a &quot;command&quot;. These values are passed to a
Perl program through <tt>@ARGV</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">comment</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A remark that doesn&rsquo;t
affect the meaning of the program. In Perl, a comment is
introduced by a <tt>&quot;#&quot;</tt> character and
continues to the end of the line.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">compilation unit</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The &quot;file&quot; (or
&quot;string&quot;, in the case of eval) that is currently
being compiled.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">compile phase</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Any time before Perl starts
running your main program. See also &quot;run phase&quot;.
Compile phase is mostly spent in &quot;compile time&quot;,
but may also be spent in &quot;run time&quot; when
<tt>&quot;BEGIN&quot;</tt> blocks, use declarations, or
constant subexpressions are being evaluated. The startup and
import code of any use declaration is also run during
compile phase.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">compile time</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The time when Perl is trying to
make sense of your code, as opposed to when it thinks it
knows what your code means and is merely trying to do what
it thinks your code says to do, which is &quot;run
time&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">compiler</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Strictly speaking, a program
that munches up another program and spits out yet another
file containing the program in a &quot;more executable&quot;
form, typically containing native machine instructions. The
<i>perl</i> program is not a compiler by this definition,
but it does contain a kind of compiler that takes a program
and turns it into a more executable form (syntax trees)
within the <i>perl</i> process itself, which the
&quot;interpreter&quot; then interprets. There are, however,
extension modules to get Perl to act more like a
&quot;real&quot; compiler. See O.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">composer</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A &quot;constructor&quot; for a
&quot;referent&quot; that isn&rsquo;t really an
&quot;object&quot;, like an anonymous array or a hash (or a
sonata, for that matter). For example, a pair of braces acts
as a composer for a hash, and a pair of brackets acts as a
composer for an array. See &quot;Making References&quot; in
perlref.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">concatenation</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The process of gluing one
cat&rsquo;s nose to another cat&rsquo;s tail. Also, a
similar operation on two strings.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">conditional</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Something &quot;iffy&quot;. See
&quot;Boolean context&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">connection</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">In telephony, the temporary
electrical circuit between the caller&rsquo;s and the
callee&rsquo;s phone. In networking, the same kind of
temporary circuit between a &quot;client&quot; and a
&quot;server&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">construct</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">As a noun, a piece of syntax
made up of smaller pieces. As a transitive verb, to create
an &quot;object&quot; using a &quot;constructor&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">constructor</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Any &quot;class method&quot;,
instance &quot;method&quot;, or &quot;subroutine&quot; that
composes, initializes, blesses, and returns an
&quot;object&quot;. Sometimes we use the term loosely to
mean a &quot;composer&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">context</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The surroundings, or
environment. The context given by the surrounding code
determines what kind of data a particular
&quot;expression&quot; is expected to return. The three
primary contexts are &quot;list context&quot;, &quot;scalar
context&quot;, and &quot;void context&quot;. Scalar context
is sometimes subdivided into &quot;Boolean context&quot;,
&quot;numeric context&quot;, &quot;string context&quot;, and
&quot;void context&quot;. There&rsquo;s also a
&quot;don&rsquo;t care&quot; scalar context (which is dealt
with in Programming Perl, Third Edition, Chapter 2,
&quot;Bits and Pieces&quot; if you care).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">continuation</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The treatment of more than one
physical &quot;line&quot; as a single logical line.
&quot;Makefile&quot; lines are continued by putting a
backslash before the &quot;newline&quot;. Mail headers as
defined by <small>RFC</small> 822 are continued by putting a
space or tab <i>after</i> the newline. In general, lines in
Perl do not need any form of continuation mark, because
&quot;whitespace&quot; (including newlines) is gleefully
ignored. Usually.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">core dump</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The corpse of a
&quot;process&quot;, in the form of a file left in the
&quot;working directory&quot; of the process, usually as a
result of certain kinds of fatal error.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><small>CPAN</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The Comprehensive Perl Archive
Network. (See &quot;What modules and extensions are
available for Perl? What is <small>CPAN</small> ?&quot; in
perlfaq2).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">cracker</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Someone who breaks security on
computer systems. A cracker may be a true &quot;hacker&quot;
or only a &quot;script kiddie&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">current package</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The &quot;package&quot; in
which the current statement is compiled. Scan backwards in
the text of your program through the current lexical scope
or any enclosing lexical scopes till you find a package
declaration. That&rsquo;s your current package name.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">current working directory</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">See &quot;working
directory&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">currently selected output
channel</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The last &quot;filehandle&quot;
that was designated with
select(<tt>&quot;FILEHANDLE&quot;</tt>); &quot;
<small>STDOUT</small> &quot;, if no filehandle has been
selected.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"

<p><small>CV</small></p></td>
<td width="3%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>An internal &quot;code value&quot; typedef, holding a
&quot;subroutine&quot;. The &quot; <small>CV</small> &quot;
type is a subclass of &quot; <small>SV</small> &quot;.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>D</b> <br>
dangling statement</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A bare, single
&quot;statement&quot;, without any braces, hanging off an
<tt>&quot;if&quot;</tt> or <tt>&quot;while&quot;</tt>
conditional. C allows them. Perl doesn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">data structure</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">How your various pieces of data
relate to each other and what shape they make when you put
them all together, as in a rectangular table or a
triangular-shaped tree.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">data type</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A set of possible values,
together with all the operations that know how to deal with
those values. For example, a numeric data type has a certain
set of numbers that you can work with and various
mathematical operations that you can do on the numbers but
would make little sense on, say, a string such as
<tt>&quot;Kilroy&quot;</tt>. Strings have their own
operations, such as &quot;concatenation&quot;. Compound
types made of a number of smaller pieces generally have
operations to compose and decompose them, and perhaps to
rearrange them. Objects that model things in the real world
often have operations that correspond to real activities.
For instance, if you model an elevator, your elevator object
might have an <tt>&quot;open_door()&quot;</tt>
&quot;method&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">datagram</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A packet of data, such as a
&quot; <small>UDP</small> &quot; message, that (from the
viewpoint of the programs involved) can be sent
independently over the network. (In fact, all packets are
sent independently at the &quot; <small>IP</small> &quot;
level, but &quot;stream&quot; protocols such as &quot;
<small>TCP</small> &quot; hide this from your program.)</p>

<p><small>DBM</small></p></td>
<td width="2%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>Stands for &quot;Data Base Management&quot; routines, a
set of routines that emulate an &quot;associative
array&quot; using disk files. The routines use a dynamic
hashing scheme to locate any entry with only two disk
accesses. <small>DBM</small> files allow a Perl program to
keep a persistent &quot;hash&quot; across multiple
invocations. You can tie your hash variables to various
<small>DBM</small> implementations--see AnyDBM_File and
DB_File.</p> </td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">declaration</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">An &quot;assertion&quot; that
states something exists and perhaps describes what
it&rsquo;s like, without giving any commitment as to how or
where you&rsquo;ll use it. A declaration is like the part of
your recipe that says, &quot;two cups flour, one large egg,
four or five tadpoles...&quot; See &quot;statement&quot; for
its opposite. Note that some declarations also function as
statements. Subroutine declarations also act as definitions
if a body is supplied.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">decrement</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">To subtract a value from a
variable, as in &quot;decrement <tt>$x</tt>&quot; (meaning
to remove 1 from its value) or &quot;decrement <tt>$x</tt>
by 3&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">default</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A &quot;value&quot; chosen for
you if you don&rsquo;t supply a value of your own.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">defined</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Having a meaning. Perl thinks
that some of the things people try to do are devoid of
meaning, in particular, making use of variables that have
never been given a &quot;value&quot; and performing certain
operations on data that isn&rsquo;t there. For example, if
you try to read data past the end of a file, Perl will hand
you back an undefined value. See also &quot;false&quot; and
&quot;defined&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">delimiter</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A &quot;character&quot; or
&quot;string&quot; that sets bounds to an arbitrarily-sized
textual object, not to be confused with a
&quot;separator&quot; or &quot;terminator&quot;. &quot;To
delimit&quot; really just means &quot;to surround&quot; or
&quot;to enclose&quot; (like these parentheses are
doing).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">deprecated modules and
features</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Deprecated modules and features
are those which were part of a stable release, but later
found to be subtly flawed, and which should be avoided. They
are subject to removal and/or bug-incompatible
reimplementation in the next major release (but they will be
preserved through maintenance releases). Deprecation
warnings are issued under <b>&minus;w</b> or <tt>&quot;use
diagnostics&quot;</tt>, and notices are found in perldeltas,
as well as various other PODs. Coding practices that misuse
features, such as <tt>&quot;my $foo if 0&quot;</tt>, can
also be deprecated.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">dereference</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A fancy computer science term
meaning &quot;to follow a &quot;reference&quot; to what it
points to&quot;. The &quot;de&quot; part of it refers to the
fact that you&rsquo;re taking away one level of
&quot;indirection&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">derived class</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A &quot;class&quot; that
defines some of its methods in terms of a more generic
class, called a &quot;base class&quot;. Note that classes
aren&rsquo;t classified exclusively into base classes or
derived classes: a class can function as both a derived
class and a base class simultaneously, which is kind of
classy.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">descriptor</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">See &quot;file
descriptor&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">destroy</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">To deallocate the memory of a
&quot;referent&quot; (first triggering its
<tt>&quot;DESTROY&quot;</tt> method, if it has one).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">destructor</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A special &quot;method&quot;
that is called when an &quot;object&quot; is thinking about
destroying itself. A Perl program&rsquo;s
<tt>&quot;DESTROY&quot;</tt> method doesn&rsquo;t do the
actual destruction; Perl just triggers the method in case
the &quot;class&quot; wants to do any associated
cleanup.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">device</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A whiz-bang hardware gizmo
(like a disk or tape drive or a modem or a joystick or a
mouse) attached to your computer, that the &quot;operating
system&quot; tries to make look like a &quot;file&quot; (or
a bunch of files). Under Unix, these fake files tend to live
in the <i>/dev</i> directory.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">directive</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A &quot;pod&quot; directive.
See perlpod.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">directory</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A special file that contains
other files. Some operating systems call these
&quot;folders&quot;, &quot;drawers&quot;, or
&quot;catalogs&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">directory handle</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A name that represents a
particular instance of opening a directory to read it, until
you close it. See the opendir function.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">dispatch</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">To send something to its
correct destination. Often used metaphorically to indicate a
transfer of programmatic control to a destination selected
algorithmically, often by lookup in a table of function
references or, in the case of object methods, by traversing
the inheritance tree looking for the most specific
definition for the method.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">distribution</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A standard, bundled release of
a system of software. The default usage implies source code
is included. If that is not the case, it will be called a
&quot;binary-only&quot; distribution.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">(to be) dropped modules</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When Perl 5 was first released
(see perlhist), several modules were included, which have
now fallen out of common use. It has been suggested that
these modules should be removed, since the distribution
became rather large, and the common criterion for new module
additions is now limited to modules that help to build,
test, and extend perl itself. Furthermore, the
<small>CPAN</small> (which didn&rsquo;t exist at the time of
Perl 5.0) can become the new home of dropped modules.
Dropping modules is currently not an option, but further
developments may clear the last barriers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">dweomer</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">An enchantment, illusion,
phantasm, or jugglery. Said when Perl&rsquo;s magical
&quot;dwimmer&quot; effects don&rsquo;t do what you expect,
but rather seem to be the product of arcane dweomercraft,
sorcery, or wonder working. [From Old English]</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">dwimmer</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><small>DWIM</small> is an
acronym for &quot;Do What I Mean&quot;, the principle that
something should just do what you want it to do without an
undue amount of fuss. A bit of code that does
&quot;dwimming&quot; is a &quot;dwimmer&quot;. Dwimming can
require a great deal of behind-the-scenes magic, which (if
it doesn&rsquo;t stay properly behind the scenes) is called
a &quot;dweomer&quot; instead.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">dynamic scoping</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Dynamic scoping works over a
dynamic scope, making variables visible throughout the rest
of the &quot;block&quot; in which they are first used and in
any subroutines that are called by the rest of the block.
Dynamically scoped variables can have their values
temporarily changed (and implicitly restored later) by a
local operator. (Compare &quot;lexical scoping&quot;.) Used
more loosely to mean how a subroutine that is in the middle
of calling another subroutine &quot;contains&quot; that
subroutine at &quot;run time&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>E</b> <br>
eclectic</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Derived from many sources. Some
would say <i>too</i> many.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">element</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A basic building block. When
you&rsquo;re talking about an &quot;array&quot;, it&rsquo;s
one of the items that make up the array.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">embedding</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When something is contained in
something else, particularly when that might be considered
surprising: &quot;I&rsquo;ve embedded a complete Perl
interpreter in my editor!&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">empty list</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">See &lt;/null list&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">empty subclass test</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The notion that an empty
&quot;derived class&quot; should behave exactly like its
&quot;base class&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">en passant</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When you change a
&quot;value&quot; as it is being copied. [From French,
&quot;in passing&quot;, as in the exotic pawn-capturing
maneuver in chess.]</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">encapsulation</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The veil of abstraction
separating the &quot;interface&quot; from the
&quot;implementation&quot; (whether enforced or not), which
mandates that all access to an &quot;object&quot;&rsquo;s
state be through methods alone.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">endian</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">See &quot;little-endian&quot;
and &quot;big-endian&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">environment</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The collective set of
environment variables your &quot;process&quot; inherits from
its parent. Accessed via <tt>%ENV</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">environment variable</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A mechanism by which some
high-level agent such as a user can pass its preferences
down to its future offspring (child processes, grandchild
processes, great-grandchild processes, and so on). Each
environment variable is a &quot;key&quot;/&quot;value&quot;
pair, like one entry in a &quot;hash&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">errno</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The error number returned by a
&quot;syscall&quot; when it fails. Perl refers to the error
by the name <tt>$!</tt> (or <tt>$OS_ERROR</tt> if you use
the English module).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">error</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">See &quot;exception&quot; or
&quot;fatal error&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">escape sequence</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">See &quot;metasymbol&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">exception</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A fancy term for an error. See
&quot;fatal error&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">exception handling</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The way a program responds to
an error. The exception handling mechanism in Perl is the
eval operator.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">exec</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">To throw away the current
&quot;process&quot;&rsquo;s program and replace it with
another without exiting the process or relinquishing any
resources held (apart from the old memory image).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">executable file</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A &quot;file&quot; that is
specially marked to tell the &quot;operating system&quot;
that it&rsquo;s okay to run this file as a program. Usually
shortened to &quot;executable&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">execute</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">To run a program or
&quot;subroutine&quot;. (Has nothing to do with the kill
built-in, unless you&rsquo;re trying to run a &quot;signal
handler&quot;.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">execute bit</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The special mark that tells the
operating system it can run this program. There are actually
three execute bits under Unix, and which bit gets used
depends on whether you own the file singularly,
collectively, or not at all.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">exit status</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">See &quot;status&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">export</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">To make symbols from a
&quot;module&quot; available for &quot;import&quot; by other
modules.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">expression</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Anything you can legally say in
a spot where a &quot;value&quot; is required. Typically
composed of literals, variables, operators, functions, and
&quot;subroutine&quot; calls, not necessarily in that
order.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">extension</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A Perl module that also pulls
in compiled C or C <small>++</small> code. More generally,
any experimental option that can be compiled into Perl, such
as multithreading.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>F</b> <br>
false</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">In Perl, any value that would
look like <tt>&quot;&quot;</tt> or <tt>&quot;0&quot;</tt> if
evaluated in a string context. Since undefined values
evaluate to <tt>&quot;&quot;</tt>, all undefined values are
false (including the &quot;null list&quot;), but not all
false values are undefined.</p>

</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">fatal error</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">An uncaught
&quot;exception&quot;, which causes termination of the
&quot;process&quot; after printing a message on your
&quot;standard error&quot; stream. Errors that happen inside
an eval are not fatal. Instead, the eval terminates after
placing the exception message in the <tt>$@</tt>
(<tt>$EVAL_ERROR</tt>) variable. You can try to provoke a
fatal error with the die operator (known as throwing or
raising an exception), but this may be caught by a
dynamically enclosing eval. If not caught, the die becomes a
fatal error.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">field</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A single piece of numeric or
string data that is part of a longer &quot;string&quot;,
&quot;record&quot;, or &quot;line&quot;. Variable-width
fields are usually split up by separators (so use split to
extract the fields), while fixed-width fields are usually at
fixed positions (so use unpack). Instance variables are also
known as fields.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><small>FIFO</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">First In, First Out. See also
&quot; <small>LIFO</small> &quot;. Also, a nickname for a
&quot;named pipe&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">file</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A named collection of data,
usually stored on disk in a &quot;directory&quot; in a
&quot;filesystem&quot;. Roughly like a document, if
you&rsquo;re into office metaphors. In modern filesystems,
you can actually give a file more than one name. Some files
have special properties, like directories and devices.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">file descriptor</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The little number the
&quot;operating system&quot; uses to keep track of which
opened &quot;file&quot; you&rsquo;re talking about. Perl
hides the file descriptor inside a &quot;standard I/O&quot;
stream and then attaches the stream to a
&quot;filehandle&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">file test operator</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A built-in unary operator that
you use to determine whether something is &quot;true&quot;
about a file, such as <tt>&quot;&minus;o
$filename&quot;</tt> to test whether you&rsquo;re the owner
of the file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">fileglob</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A &quot;wildcard&quot; match on
filenames. See the glob function.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">filehandle</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">An identifier (not necessarily
related to the real name of a file) that represents a
particular instance of opening a file until you close it. If
you&rsquo;re going to open and close several different files
in succession, it&rsquo;s fine to open each of them with the
same filehandle, so you don&rsquo;t have to write out
separate code to process each file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">filename</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">One name for a file. This name
is listed in a &quot;directory&quot;, and you can use it in
an open to tell the &quot;operating system&quot; exactly
which file you want to open, and associate the file with a
&quot;filehandle&quot; which will carry the subsequent
identity of that file in your program, until you close
it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">filesystem</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A set of directories and files
residing on a partition of the disk. Sometimes known as a
&quot;partition&quot;. You can change the file&rsquo;s name
or even move a file around from directory to directory
within a filesystem without actually moving the file itself,
at least under Unix.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">filter</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A program designed to take a
&quot;stream&quot; of input and transform it into a stream
of output.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">flag</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">We tend to avoid this term
because it means so many things. It may mean a command-line
&quot;switch&quot; that takes no argument itself (such as
Perl&rsquo;s <b>&minus;n</b> and <b>&minus;p</b> flags) or,
less frequently, a single-bit indicator (such as the
<tt>&quot;O_CREAT&quot;</tt> and <tt>&quot;O_EXCL&quot;</tt>
flags used in sysopen).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">floating point</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A method of storing numbers in
&quot;scientific notation&quot;, such that the precision of
the number is independent of its magnitude (the decimal
point &quot;floats&quot;). Perl does its numeric work with
floating-point numbers (sometimes called
&quot;floats&quot;), when it can&rsquo;t get away with using
integers. Floating-point numbers are mere approximations of
real numbers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">flush</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The act of emptying a
&quot;buffer&quot;, often before it&rsquo;s full.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><small>FMTEYEWTK</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Far More Than Everything You
Ever Wanted To Know. An exhaustive treatise on one narrow
topic, something of a super&minus;&quot; <small>FAQ</small>
&quot;. See Tom for far more.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">fork</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">To create a child
&quot;process&quot; identical to the parent process at its
moment of conception, at least until it gets ideas of its
own. A thread with protected memory.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">formal arguments</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The generic names by which a
&quot;subroutine&quot; knows its arguments. In many
languages, formal arguments are always given individual
names, but in Perl, the formal arguments are just the
elements of an array. The formal arguments to a Perl program
are <tt>$ARGV[0]</tt>, <tt>$ARGV[1]</tt>, and so on.
Similarly, the formal arguments to a Perl subroutine are
<tt>$_[0]</tt>, <tt>$_[1]</tt>, and so on. You may give the
arguments individual names by assigning the values to a my
list. See also &quot;actual arguments&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">format</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A specification of how many
spaces and digits and things to put somewhere so that
whatever you&rsquo;re printing comes out nice and
pretty.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">freely available</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Means you don&rsquo;t have to
pay money to get it, but the copyright on it may still
belong to someone else (like Larry).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">freely redistributable</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Means you&rsquo;re not in legal
trouble if you give a bootleg copy of it to your friends and
we find out about it. In fact, we&rsquo;d rather you gave a
copy to all your friends.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">freeware</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Historically, any software that
you give away, particularly if you make the source code
available as well. Now often called <tt>&quot;open source
software&quot;</tt>. Recently there has been a trend to use
the term in contradistinction to &quot;open source
software&quot;, to refer only to free software released
under the Free Software Foundation&rsquo;s
<small>GPL</small> (General Public License), but this is
difficult to justify etymologically.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">function</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Mathematically, a mapping of
each of a set of input values to a particular output value.
In computers, refers to a &quot;subroutine&quot; or
&quot;operator&quot; that returns a &quot;value&quot;. It
may or may not have input values (called arguments).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">funny character</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Someone like Larry, or one of
his peculiar friends. Also refers to the strange prefixes
that Perl requires as noun markers on its variables.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>G</b> <br>
garbage collection</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A misnamed feature--it should
be called, &quot;expecting your mother to pick up after
you&quot;. Strictly speaking, Perl doesn&rsquo;t do this,
but it relies on a reference-counting mechanism to keep
things tidy. However, we rarely speak strictly and will
often refer to the reference-counting scheme as a form of
garbage collection. (If it&rsquo;s any comfort, when your
interpreter exits, a &quot;real&quot; garbage collector runs
to make sure everything is cleaned up if you&rsquo;ve been
messy with circular references and such.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">glob</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Strictly, the shell&rsquo;s
<tt>&quot;*&quot;</tt> character, which will match a
&quot;glob&quot; of characters when you&rsquo;re trying to
generate a list of filenames. Loosely, the act of using
globs and similar symbols to do pattern matching. See also
&quot;fileglob&quot; and &quot;typeglob&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">global</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Something you can see from
anywhere, usually used of variables and subroutines that are
visible everywhere in your program. In Perl, only certain
special variables are truly global--most variables (and all
subroutines) exist only in the current &quot;package&quot;.
Global variables can be declared with our. See
&quot;our&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">global destruction</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The &quot;garbage
collection&quot; of globals (and the running of any
associated object destructors) that takes place when a Perl
&quot;interpreter&quot; is being shut down. Global
destruction should not be confused with the Apocalypse,
except perhaps when it should.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">glue language</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A language such as Perl that is
good at hooking things together that weren&rsquo;t intended
to be hooked together.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">granularity</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The size of the pieces
you&rsquo;re dealing with, mentally speaking.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">greedy</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A &quot;subpattern&quot; whose
&quot;quantifier&quot; wants to match as many things as
possible.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">grep</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Originally from the old Unix
editor command for &quot;Globally search for a Regular
Expression and Print it&quot;, now used in the general sense
of any kind of search, especially text searches. Perl has a
built-in grep function that searches a list for elements
matching any given criterion, whereas the <i>grep</i>(1)
program searches for lines matching a &quot;regular
expression&quot; in one or more files.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">group</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A set of users of which you are
a member. In some operating systems (like Unix), you can
give certain file access permissions to other members of
your group.</p>

</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>H</b> <br>
hacker</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Someone who is brilliantly
persistent in solving technical problems, whether these
involve golfing, fighting orcs, or programming. Hacker is a
neutral term, morally speaking. Good hackers are not to be
confused with evil crackers or clueless script kiddies. If
you confuse them, we will presume that you are either evil
or clueless.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">handler</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A &quot;subroutine&quot; or
&quot;method&quot; that is called by Perl when your program
needs to respond to some internal event, such as a
&quot;signal&quot;, or an encounter with an operator subject
to &quot;operator overloading&quot;. See also
&quot;callback&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">hard reference</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A &quot;scalar&quot;
&quot;value&quot; containing the actual address of a
&quot;referent&quot;, such that the referent&rsquo;s
&quot;reference&quot; count accounts for it. (Some hard
references are held internally, such as the implicit
reference from one of a &quot;typeglob&quot;&rsquo;s
variable slots to its corresponding referent.) A hard
reference is different from a &quot;symbolic
reference&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">hash</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">An unordered association of
&quot;key&quot;/&quot;value&quot; pairs, stored such that
you can easily use a string &quot;key&quot; to look up its
associated data &quot;value&quot;. This glossary is like a
hash, where the word to be defined is the key, and the
definition is the value. A hash is also sometimes
septisyllabically called an &quot;associative array&quot;,
which is a pretty good reason for simply calling it a
&quot;hash&quot; instead. A hash can optionally be
restricted to a fixed set of keys.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">hash table</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A data structure used
internally by Perl for implementing associative arrays
(hashes) efficiently. See also &quot;bucket&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">header file</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A file containing certain
required definitions that you must include &quot;ahead&quot;
of the rest of your program to do certain obscure
operations. A C header file has a <i>.h</i> extension. Perl
doesn&rsquo;t really have header files, though historically
Perl has sometimes used translated <i>.h</i> files with a
<i>.ph</i> extension. See &quot;require&quot; in perlfunc.
(Header files have been superseded by the &quot;module&quot;
mechanism.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">here document</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">So called because of a similar
construct in shells that pretends that the lines following
the &quot;command&quot; are a separate &quot;file&quot; to
be fed to the command, up to some terminating string. In
Perl, however, it&rsquo;s just a fancy form of quoting.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">hexadecimal</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A number in base 16,
&quot;hex&quot; for short. The digits for 10 through 16 are
customarily represented by the letters
<tt>&quot;a&quot;</tt> through <tt>&quot;f&quot;</tt>.
Hexadecimal constants in Perl start with
<tt>&quot;0x&quot;</tt>. See also &quot;hex&quot; in
perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">home directory</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The directory you are put into
when you log in. On a Unix system, the name is often placed
into <tt>$ENV{HOME}</tt> or <tt>$ENV{LOGDIR}</tt> by
<i>login</i>, but you can also find it with
<tt>&quot;(getpwuid($&lt;))[7]&quot;</tt>. (Some platforms
do not have a concept of a home directory.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">host</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The computer on which a program
or other data resides.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">hubris</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Excessive pride, the sort of
thing Zeus zaps you for. Also the quality that makes you
write (and maintain) programs that other people won&rsquo;t
want to say bad things about. Hence, the third great virtue
of a programmer. See also &quot;laziness&quot; and
&quot;impatience&quot;.</p>

</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>I</b> <br>
identifier</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A legally formed name for most
anything in which a computer program might be interested.
Many languages (including Perl) allow identifiers that start
with a letter and contain letters and digits. Perl also
counts the underscore character as a valid letter. (Perl
also has more complicated names, such as
&quot;qualified&quot; names.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">impatience</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The anger you feel when the
computer is being lazy. This makes you write programs that
don&rsquo;t just react to your needs, but actually
anticipate them. Or at least that pretend to. Hence, the
second great virtue of a programmer. See also
&quot;laziness&quot; and &quot;hubris&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">implementation</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">How a piece of code actually
goes about doing its job. Users of the code should not count
on implementation details staying the same unless they are
part of the published &quot;interface&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">import</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">To gain access to symbols that
are exported from another module. See &quot;use&quot; in
perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">increment</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">To increase the value of
something by 1 (or by some other number, if so
specified).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">indexing</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">In olden days, the act of
looking up a &quot;key&quot; in an actual index (such as a
phone book), but now merely the act of using any kind of key
or position to find the corresponding &quot;value&quot;,
even if no index is involved. Things have degenerated to the
point that Perl&rsquo;s index function merely locates the
position (index) of one string in another.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">indirect filehandle</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">An &quot;expression&quot; that
evaluates to something that can be used as a
&quot;filehandle&quot;: a &quot;string&quot; (filehandle
name), a &quot;typeglob&quot;, a typeglob
&quot;reference&quot;, or a low-level &quot;
<small>IO</small> &quot; object.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">indirect object</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">In English grammar, a short
noun phrase between a verb and its direct object indicating
the beneficiary or recipient of the action. In Perl,
<tt>&quot;print STDOUT &quot;$foo\n&quot;;&quot;</tt> can be
understood as &quot;verb indirect-object object&quot; where
&quot; <small>STDOUT</small> &quot; is the recipient of the
print action, and <tt>&quot;$foo&quot;</tt> is the object
being printed. Similarly, when invoking a
&quot;method&quot;, you might place the invocant between the
method and its arguments:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">  $gollum = new Pathetic::Creature &quot;Smeagol&quot;;
  give $gollum &quot;Fisssssh!&quot;;
  give $gollum &quot;Precious!&quot;;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">In modern Perl,
calling methods this way is often considered bad practice
and to be avoided.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">indirect object slot</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The syntactic position falling
between a method call and its arguments when using the
indirect object invocation syntax. (The slot is
distinguished by the absence of a comma between it and the
next argument.) &quot; <small>STDERR</small> &quot; is in
the indirect object slot here:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">  print STDERR &quot;Awake!  Awake!  Fear, Fire,
      Foes!  Awake!\n&quot;;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%;">indirection</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">If something in a program
isn&rsquo;t the value you&rsquo;re looking for but indicates
where the value is, that&rsquo;s indirection. This can be
done with either symbolic references or hard references.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">infix</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">An &quot;operator&quot; that
comes in between its operands, such as multiplication in
<tt>&quot;24 * 7&quot;</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">inheritance</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">What you get from your
ancestors, genetically or otherwise. If you happen to be a
&quot;class&quot;, your ancestors are called base classes
and your descendants are called derived classes. See
&quot;single inheritance&quot; and &quot;multiple
inheritance&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">instance</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Short for &quot;an instance of
a class&quot;, meaning an &quot;object&quot; of that
&quot;class&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">instance variable</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">An &quot;attribute&quot; of an
&quot;object&quot;; data stored with the particular object
rather than with the class as a whole.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">integer</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A number with no fractional
(decimal) part. A counting number, like 1, 2, 3, and so on,
but including 0 and the negatives.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">interface</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The services a piece of code
promises to provide forever, in contrast to its
&quot;implementation&quot;, which it should feel free to
change whenever it likes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">interpolation</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The insertion of a scalar or
list value somewhere in the middle of another value, such
that it appears to have been there all along. In Perl,
variable interpolation happens in double-quoted strings and
patterns, and list interpolation occurs when constructing
the list of values to pass to a list operator or other such
construct that takes a &quot; <small>LIST</small>
&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">interpreter</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Strictly speaking, a program
that reads a second program and does what the second program
says directly without turning the program into a different
form first, which is what compilers do. Perl is not an
interpreter by this definition, because it contains a kind
of compiler that takes a program and turns it into a more
executable form (syntax trees) within the <i>perl</i>
process itself, which the Perl &quot;run time&quot; system
then interprets.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">invocant</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The agent on whose behalf a
&quot;method&quot; is invoked. In a &quot;class&quot;
method, the invocant is a package name. In an
&quot;instance&quot; method, the invocant is an object
reference.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">invocation</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The act of calling up a deity,
daemon, program, method, subroutine, or function to get it
do what you think it&rsquo;s supposed to do. We usually
&quot;call&quot; subroutines but &quot;invoke&quot; methods,
since it sounds cooler.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">is-a</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A relationship between two
objects in which one object is considered to be a more
specific version of the other, generic object: &quot;A camel
is a mammal.&quot; Since the generic object really only
exists in a Platonic sense, we usually add a little
abstraction to the notion of objects and think of the
relationship as being between a generic &quot;base
class&quot; and a specific &quot;derived class&quot;. Oddly
enough, Platonic classes don&rsquo;t always have Platonic
relationships--see &quot;inheritance&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">iteration</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Doing something repeatedly.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">iterator</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A special programming gizmo
that keeps track of where you are in something that
you&rsquo;re trying to iterate over. The
<tt>&quot;foreach&quot;</tt> loop in Perl contains an
iterator; so does a hash, allowing you to each through
it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A name you give to a
&quot;statement&quot; so that you can talk about that
statement elsewhere in the program.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">laziness</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The quality that makes you go
to great effort to reduce overall energy expenditure. It
makes you write labor-saving programs that other people will
find useful, and document what you wrote so you don&rsquo;t
have to answer so many questions about it. Hence, the first
great virtue of a programmer. Also hence, this book. See
also &quot;impatience&quot; and &quot;hubris&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">left shift</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A &quot;bit shift&quot; that
multiplies the number by some power of 2.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">leftmost longest</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The preference of the
&quot;regular expression&quot; engine to match the leftmost
occurrence of a &quot;pattern&quot;, then given a position
at which a match will occur, the preference for the longest
match (presuming the use of a &quot;greedy&quot;
quantifier). See perlre for <i>much</i> more on this
subject.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">lexeme</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Fancy term for a

<p style="margin-left:11%;">lexer</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Fancy term for a
&quot;tokener&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">lexical analysis</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Fancy term for
&quot;tokenizing&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">lexical scoping</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Looking at your <i>Oxford
English Dictionary</i> through a microscope. (Also known as
&quot;static scoping&quot;, because dictionaries don&rsquo;t
change very fast.) Similarly, looking at variables stored in
a private dictionary (namespace) for each scope, which are
visible only from their point of declaration down to the end
of the lexical scope in which they are declared.
&minus;&minus;Syn. &quot;static scoping&quot;.
&minus;&minus;Ant. &quot;dynamic scoping&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">lexical variable</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A &quot;variable&quot; subject
to &quot;lexical scoping&quot;, declared by my. Often just
called a &quot;lexical&quot;. (The our declaration declares
a lexically scoped name for a global variable, which is not
itself a lexical variable.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">library</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Generally, a collection of
procedures. In ancient days, referred to a collection of
subroutines in a <i>.pl</i> file. In modern times, refers
more often to the entire collection of Perl modules on your
system.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><small>LIFO</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Last In, First Out. See also
&quot; <small>FIFO</small> &quot;. A <small>LIFO</small> is
usually called a &quot;stack&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">line</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">In Unix, a sequence of zero or
more non-newline characters terminated with a
&quot;newline&quot; character. On non-Unix machines, this is
emulated by the C library even if the underlying
&quot;operating system&quot; has different ideas.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">line buffering</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Used by a &quot;standard
I/O&quot; output stream that flushes its &quot;buffer&quot;
after every &quot;newline&quot;. Many standard I/O libraries
automatically set up line buffering on output that is going
to the terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">line number</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The number of lines read
previous to this one, plus 1. Perl keeps a separate line
number for each source or input file it opens. The current
source file&rsquo;s line number is represented by
<tt>&quot;__LINE__&quot;</tt>. The current input line number
(for the file that was most recently read via
<tt>&quot;&lt;FH&gt;&quot;</tt>) is represented by the
<tt>$.</tt> (<tt>$INPUT_LINE_NUMBER</tt>) variable. Many
error messages report both values, if available.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">link</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Used as a noun, a name in a
&quot;directory&quot;, representing a &quot;file&quot;. A
given file can have multiple links to it. It&rsquo;s like
having the same phone number listed in the phone directory
under different names. As a verb, to resolve a partially
compiled file&rsquo;s unresolved symbols into a (nearly)
executable image. Linking can generally be static or
dynamic, which has nothing to do with static or dynamic
scoping.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><small>LIST</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A syntactic construct
representing a comma-separated list of expressions,
evaluated to produce a &quot;list value&quot;. Each
&quot;expression&quot; in a &quot; <small>LIST</small>
&quot; is evaluated in &quot;list context&quot; and
interpolated into the list value.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">list</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">An ordered set of scalar
values.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">list context</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The situation in which an
&quot;expression&quot; is expected by its surroundings (the
code calling it) to return a list of values rather than a
single value. Functions that want a &quot;
<small>LIST</small> &quot; of arguments tell those arguments
that they should produce a list value. See also
&quot;context&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">list operator</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">An &quot;operator&quot; that
does something with a list of values, such as join or grep.
Usually used for named built-in operators (such as print,
unlink, and system) that do not require parentheses around
their &quot;argument&quot; list.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">list value</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">An unnamed list of temporary
scalar values that may be passed around within a program
from any list-generating function to any function or
construct that provides a &quot;list context&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">literal</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A token in a programming
language such as a number or &quot;string&quot; that gives
you an actual &quot;value&quot; instead of merely
representing possible values as a &quot;variable&quot;
does.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">little-endian</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">From Swift: someone who eats
eggs little end first. Also used of computers that store the
least significant &quot;byte&quot; of a word at a lower byte
address than the most significant byte. Often considered
superior to big-endian machines. See also
&quot;big-endian&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">local</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Not meaning the same thing
everywhere. A global variable in Perl can be localized
inside a dynamic scope via the local operator.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">logical operator</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Symbols representing the
concepts &quot;and&quot;, &quot;or&quot;, &quot;xor&quot;,
and &quot;not&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">lookahead</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">An &quot;assertion&quot; that
peeks at the string to the right of the current match
location.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">lookbehind</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">An &quot;assertion&quot; that
peeks at the string to the left of the current match
location.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">loop</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A construct that performs
something repeatedly, like a roller coaster.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">loop control statement</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Any statement within the body
of a loop that can make a loop prematurely stop looping or
skip an &quot;iteration&quot;. Generally you shouldn&rsquo;t
try this on roller coasters.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">loop label</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A kind of key or name attached
to a loop (or roller coaster) so that loop control
statements can talk about which loop they want to
control.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">lvaluable</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Able to serve as an
&quot;lvalue&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">lvalue</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Term used by language lawyers
for a storage location you can assign a new
&quot;value&quot; to, such as a &quot;variable&quot; or an
element of an &quot;array&quot;. The &quot;l&quot; is short
for &quot;left&quot;, as in the left side of an assignment,
a typical place for lvalues. An &quot;lvaluable&quot;
function or expression is one to which a value may be
assigned, as in <tt>&quot;pos($x) = 10&quot;</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">lvalue modifier</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">An adjectival pseudofunction
that warps the meaning of an &quot;lvalue&quot; in some
declarative fashion. Currently there are three lvalue
modifiers: my, our, and local.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>M</b> <br>
magic</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Technically speaking, any extra
semantics attached to a variable such as <tt>$!</tt>,
<tt>$0</tt>, <tt>%ENV</tt>, or <tt>%SIG</tt>, or to any tied
variable. Magical things happen when you diddle those
variables.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">magical increment</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">An &quot;increment&quot;
operator that knows how to bump up alphabetics as well as
numbers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">magical variables</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Special variables that have
side effects when you access them or assign to them. For
example, in Perl, changing elements of the <tt>%ENV</tt>
array also changes the corresponding environment variables
that subprocesses will use. Reading the <tt>$!</tt> variable
gives you the current system error number or message.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Makefile</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A file that controls the
compilation of a program. Perl programs don&rsquo;t usually
need a &quot;Makefile&quot; because the Perl compiler has
plenty of self-control.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">manpage</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A &quot;page&quot; from the
manuals, typically accessed via the <i>man</i>(1) command. A
manpage contains a <small>SYNOPSIS</small> , a
<small>DESCRIPTION</small> , a list of <small>BUGS</small> ,
and so on, and is typically longer than a page. There are
manpages documenting commands, syscalls, &quot;library&quot;
functions, devices, protocols, files, and such. In this
book, we call any piece of standard Perl documentation (like
<i>perlop</i> or <i>perldelta</i>) a manpage, no matter what
format it&rsquo;s installed in on your system.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">matching</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">See &quot;pattern
matching&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">member data</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">See &quot;instance
variable&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">memory</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This always means your main
memory, not your disk. Clouding the issue is the fact that
your machine may implement &quot;virtual&quot; memory; that
is, it will pretend that it has more memory than it really
does, and it&rsquo;ll use disk space to hold inactive bits.
This can make it seem like you have a little more memory
than you really do, but it&rsquo;s not a substitute for real
memory. The best thing that can be said about virtual memory
is that it lets your performance degrade gradually rather
than suddenly when you run out of real memory. But your
program can die when you run out of virtual memory too, if
you haven&rsquo;t thrashed your disk to death first.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">metacharacter</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A &quot;character&quot; that is
<i>not</i> supposed to be treated normally. Which characters
are to be treated specially as metacharacters varies greatly
from context to context. Your &quot;shell&quot; will have
certain metacharacters, double-quoted Perl strings have
other metacharacters, and &quot;regular expression&quot;
patterns have all the double-quote metacharacters plus some
extra ones of their own.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">metasymbol</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Something we&rsquo;d call a
&quot;metacharacter&quot; except that it&rsquo;s a sequence
of more than one character. Generally, the first character
in the sequence must be a true metacharacter to get the
other characters in the metasymbol to misbehave along with
it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">method</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A kind of action that an
&quot;object&quot; can take if you tell it to. See
perlobj.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">minimalism</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The belief that &quot;small is
beautiful.&quot; Paradoxically, if you say something in a
small language, it turns out big, and if you say it in a big
language, it turns out small. Go figure.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">mode</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">In the context of the
<i>stat</i>(2) syscall, refers to the field holding the
&quot;permission bits&quot; and the type of the
&quot;file&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">modifier</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">See &quot;statement
modifier&quot;, &quot;regular expression modifier&quot;, and
&quot;lvalue modifier&quot;, not necessarily in that
order.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">module</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A &quot;file&quot; that defines
a &quot;package&quot; of (almost) the same name, which can
either &quot;export&quot; symbols or function as an
&quot;object&quot; class. (A module&rsquo;s main <i>.pm</i>
file may also load in other files in support of the module.)
See the use built-in.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">modulus</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">An integer divisor when
you&rsquo;re interested in the remainder instead of the
quotient.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">monger</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Short for Perl Monger, a
purveyor of Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">mortal</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A temporary value scheduled to
die when the current statement finishes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">multidimensional array</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">An array with multiple
subscripts for finding a single element. Perl implements
these using references&minus;&minus;see perllol and
perldsc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">multiple inheritance</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The features you got from your
mother and father, mixed together unpredictably. (See also
&quot;inheritance&quot;, and &quot;single
inheritance&quot;.) In computer languages (including Perl),
the notion that a given class may have multiple direct
ancestors or base classes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>N</b> <br>
named pipe</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A &quot;pipe&quot; with a name
embedded in the &quot;filesystem&quot; so that it can be
accessed by two unrelated processes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">namespace</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A domain of names. You
needn&rsquo;t worry about whether the names in one such
domain have been used in another. See
&quot;package&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">network address</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The most important attribute of
a socket, like your telephone&rsquo;s telephone number.
Typically an <small>IP</small> address. See also
&quot;port&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">newline</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A single character that
represents the end of a line, with the <small>ASCII</small>
value of 012 octal under Unix (but 015 on a Mac), and
represented by <tt>&quot;\n&quot;</tt> in Perl strings. For
Windows machines writing text files, and for certain
physical devices like terminals, the single newline gets
automatically translated by your C library into a line feed
and a carriage return, but normally, no translation is
done.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">null character</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A character with the
<small>ASCII</small> value of zero. It&rsquo;s used by C to
terminate strings, but Perl allows strings to contain a
null.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">null list</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A valueless value represented
in Perl by <tt>&quot;()&quot;</tt>. It is not really a
&quot; <small>LIST</small> &quot;, but an expression that
yields <tt>&quot;undef&quot;</tt> in &quot;scalar
context&quot; and a &quot;list value&quot; with zero
elements in &quot;list context&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">null string</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A &quot;string&quot; containing
no characters, not to be confused with a string containing a
&quot;null character&quot;, which has a positive length and
is &quot;true&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">numeric context</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The situation in which an
expression is expected by its surroundings (the code calling
it) to return a number. See also &quot;context&quot; and
&quot;string context&quot;.</p>

</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">nybble</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Half a &quot;byte&quot;,
equivalent to one &quot;hexadecimal&quot; digit, and worth
four bits.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>O</b> <br>
object</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">An &quot;instance&quot; of a
&quot;class&quot;. Something that &quot;knows&quot; what
user-defined type (class) it is, and what it can do because
of what class it is. Your program can request an object to
do things, but the object gets to decide whether it wants to
do them or not. Some objects are more accommodating than
others.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">octal</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A number in base 8. Only the
digits 0 through 7 are allowed. Octal constants in Perl
start with 0, as in 013. See also the oct function.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">offset</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">How many things you have to
skip over when moving from the beginning of a string or
array to a specific position within it. Thus, the minimum
offset is zero, not one, because you don&rsquo;t skip
anything to get to the first item.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">one-liner</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">An entire computer program
crammed into one line of text.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">open source software</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Programs for which the source
code is freely available and freely redistributable, with no
commercial strings attached. For a more detailed definition,
see &lt;http://www.opensource.org/osd.html&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">operand</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">An &quot;expression&quot; that
yields a &quot;value&quot; that an &quot;operator&quot;
operates on. See also &quot;precedence&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">operating system</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A special program that runs on
the bare machine and hides the gory details of managing
processes and devices. Usually used in a looser sense to
indicate a particular culture of programming. The loose
sense can be used at varying levels of specificity. At one
extreme, you might say that all versions of Unix and
Unix-lookalikes are the same operating system (upsetting
many people, especially lawyers and other advocates). At the
other extreme, you could say this particular version of this
particular vendor&rsquo;s operating system is different from
any other version of this or any other vendor&rsquo;s
operating system. Perl is much more portable across
operating systems than many other languages. See also
&quot;architecture&quot; and &quot;platform&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">operator</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A gizmo that transforms some
number of input values to some number of output values,
often built into a language with a special syntax or symbol.
A given operator may have specific expectations about what
types of data you give as its arguments (operands) and what
type of data you want back from it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">operator overloading</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A kind of
&quot;overloading&quot; that you can do on built-in
operators to make them work on objects as if the objects
were ordinary scalar values, but with the actual semantics
supplied by the object class. This is set up with the
overload &quot;pragma&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">options</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">See either switches or
&quot;regular expression modifier&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">ordinal</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Another name for &quot;code
point&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">overloading</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Giving additional meanings to a
symbol or construct. Actually, all languages do overloading
to one extent or another, since people are good at figuring
out things from &quot;context&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">overriding</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Hiding or invalidating some
other definition of the same name. (Not to be confused with
&quot;overloading&quot;, which adds definitions that must be
disambiguated some other way.) To confuse the issue further,
we use the word with two overloaded definitions: to describe
how you can define your own &quot;subroutine&quot; to hide a
built-in &quot;function&quot; of the same name (see
&quot;Overriding Built-in Functions&quot; in perlsub) and to
describe how you can define a replacement &quot;method&quot;
in a &quot;derived class&quot; to hide a &quot;base
class&quot;&rsquo;s method of the same name (see

<p style="margin-left:11%;">owner</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The one user (apart from the

exercise joint ownership if the real owner permits it. See
&quot;permission bits&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>P</b> <br>
package</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A &quot;namespace&quot; for
global variables, subroutines, and the like, such that they
can be kept separate from like-named symbols in other
namespaces. In a sense, only the package is global, since
the symbols in the package&rsquo;s symbol table are only
accessible from code compiled outside the package by naming
the package. But in another sense, all package symbols are
also globals--they&rsquo;re just well-organized globals.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">permission bits</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Bits that the &quot;owner&quot;
of a file sets or unsets to allow or disallow access to
other people. These flag bits are part of the
&quot;mode&quot; word returned by the stat built-in when you

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Pern</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">What you get when you do

row, linked by pipes, where each passes its output stream to
the next.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The entire hardware and
software context in which a program runs. A <br>
program written in a platform-dependent language might break
if you change any of: machine, operating system, libraries,
compiler, or system configuration. The <i>perl</i>
interpreter has to be compiled differently for each platform
because it is implemented in C, but programs written in the
Perl language are largely platform-independent.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">pointer</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A &quot;variable&quot; in a
language like C that contains the exact memory location of
some other item. Perl handles pointers internally so you
don&rsquo;t have to worry about them. Instead, you just use
symbolic pointers in the form of keys and
&quot;variable&quot; names, or hard references, which
aren&rsquo;t pointers (but act like pointers and do in fact
contain pointers).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">polymorphism</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The notion that you can tell an
&quot;object&quot; to do something generic, and the object
will interpret the command in different ways depending on
its type. [&lt;Gk many shapes]</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">port</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The part of the address of a
<small>TCP</small> or <small>UDP</small> socket that directs
packets to the correct process after finding the right
machine, something like the phone extension you give when
you reach the company operator. Also, the result of
converting code to run on a different platform than
originally intended, or the verb denoting this
conversion.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">portable</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Once upon a time, C code
compilable under both <small>BSD</small> and SysV. In
general, code that can be easily converted to run on another
&quot;platform&quot;, where &quot;easily&quot; can be
defined however you like, and usually is. Anything may be
considered portable if you try hard enough. See <i>mobile
home</i> or <i>London Bridge</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">porter</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Someone who &quot;carries&quot;
software from one &quot;platform&quot; to another. Porting
programs written in platform-dependent languages such as C
can be difficult work, but porting programs like Perl is
very much worth the agony.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A &quot;subroutine&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">process</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">An instance of a running
program. Under multitasking systems like Unix, two or more
separate processes could be running the same program
independently at the same time--in fact, the fork function
is designed to bring about this happy state of affairs.
Under other operating systems, processes are sometimes
called &quot;threads&quot;, &quot;tasks&quot;, or
&quot;jobs&quot;, often with slight nuances in meaning.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">program generator</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A system that algorithmically
writes code for you in a high-level language. See also
&quot;code generator&quot;.</p>

correspondent will get too confused.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">prototype</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">An optional part of a
&quot;subroutine&quot; declaration telling the Perl compiler
how many and what flavor of arguments may be passed as
&quot;actual arguments&quot;, so that you can write
subroutine calls that parse much like built-in functions.
(Or don&rsquo;t parse, as the case may be.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">pseudofunction</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A construct that sometimes
looks like a function but really isn&rsquo;t. Usually
reserved for &quot;lvalue&quot; modifiers like my, for
&quot;context&quot; modifiers like scalar, and for the
pick-your-own-quotes constructs, <tt>&quot;q//&quot;</tt>,

<p style="margin-left:11%;">pseudohash</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A reference to an array whose

looks something like a &quot;literal&quot;, such as the
output-grabbing operator,
<tt>&quot;`&quot;</tt><i>&quot;command&quot;</i><tt>&quot;`&quot;</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">public domain</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Something not owned by anybody.
Perl is copyrighted and is thus <i>not</i> in the public
domain--it&rsquo;s just &quot;freely available&quot; and
&quot;freely redistributable&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">pumpkin</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A notional &quot;baton&quot;

unqualified. A fully qualified filename is specified from
the top-level directory.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">quantifier</p>

&quot;atom&quot; may occur.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>R</b> <br>
readable</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">With respect to files, one that
has the proper permission bit set to let you access the

written well enough that someone has a chance of figuring
out what it&rsquo;s trying to do.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">reaping</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The last rites performed by a
parent &quot;process&quot; on behalf of a deceased child
process so that it doesn&rsquo;t remain a
&quot;zombie&quot;. See the wait and waitpid function
calls.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">record</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A set of related data values in
a &quot;file&quot; or &quot;stream&quot;, often associated
with a unique &quot;key&quot; field. In Unix, often
commensurate with a &quot;line&quot;, or a
blank-line-terminated set of lines (a
&quot;paragraph&quot;). Each line of the <i>/etc/passwd</i>
file is a record, keyed on login name, containing
information about that user.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">recursion</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The art of defining something
(at least partly) in terms of itself, which is a naughty
no-no in dictionaries but often works out okay in computer
programs if you&rsquo;re careful not to recurse forever,
which is like an infinite loop with more spectacular failure
modes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">reference</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Where you look to find a
pointer to information somewhere else. (See
&quot;indirection&quot;.) References come in two flavors,
symbolic references and hard references.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">referent</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Whatever a reference refers to,
which may or may not have a name. Common types of referents
include scalars, arrays, hashes, and subroutines.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">regex</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">See &quot;regular
expression&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">regular expression</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A single entity with various
interpretations, like an elephant. To a computer scientist,
it&rsquo;s a grammar for a little language in which some
strings are legal and others aren&rsquo;t. To normal people,
it&rsquo;s a pattern you can use to find what you&rsquo;re
looking for when it varies from case to case. Perl&rsquo;s
regular expressions are far from regular in the theoretical
sense, but in regular use they work quite well. Here&rsquo;s
a regular expression: <tt>&quot;/Oh s.*t./&quot;</tt>. This
will match strings like &quot;<tt>&quot;Oh say can you see
by the dawn's early light&quot;</tt>&quot; and
&quot;<tt>&quot;Oh sit!&quot;</tt>&quot;. See perlre.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">regular expression modifier</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">An option on a pattern or
substitution, such as <tt>&quot;/i&quot;</tt> to render the
pattern case insensitive. See also &quot;cloister&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">regular file</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A &quot;file&quot; that&rsquo;s
not a &quot;directory&quot;, a &quot;device&quot;, a named
&quot;pipe&quot; or &quot;socket&quot;, or a &quot;symbolic
link&quot;. Perl uses the <tt>&quot;&minus;f&quot;</tt> file
test operator to identify regular files. Sometimes called a
&quot;plain&quot; file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">relational operator</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">An &quot;operator&quot; that
says whether a particular ordering relationship is
&quot;true&quot; about a pair of operands. Perl has both
numeric and string relational operators. See &quot;collating
sequence&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">reserved words</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A word with a specific,
built-in meaning to a &quot;compiler&quot;, such as
<tt>&quot;if&quot;</tt> or delete. In many languages (not
Perl), it&rsquo;s illegal to use reserved words to name
anything else. (Which is why they&rsquo;re reserved, after
all.) In Perl, you just can&rsquo;t use them to name labels
or filehandles. Also called &quot;keywords&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">restricted hash</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A &quot;hash&quot; with a
closed set of allowed keys. See Hash::Util.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">return value</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The &quot;value&quot; produced

<p style="margin-left:11%;">run phase</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Any time after Perl starts
running your main program. See also &quot;compile
phase&quot;. Run phase is mostly spent in &quot;run
time&quot; but may also be spent in &quot;compile time&quot;
when require, do <tt>&quot;FILE&quot;</tt>, or eval
<tt>&quot;STRING&quot;</tt> operators are executed or when a
substitution uses the <tt>&quot;/ee&quot;</tt> modifier.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">run time</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The time when Perl is actually
doing what your code says to do, as opposed to the earlier
period of time when it was trying to figure out whether what
you said made any sense whatsoever, which is &quot;compile
time&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">run-time pattern</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A pattern that contains one or
more variables to be interpolated before parsing the pattern
as a &quot;regular expression&quot;, and that therefore
cannot be analyzed at compile time, but must be re-analyzed
each time the pattern match operator is evaluated. Run-time
patterns are useful but expensive.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A simple, singular value; a
number, &quot;string&quot;, or &quot;reference&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">scalar context</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The situation in which an
&quot;expression&quot; is expected by its surroundings (the
code calling it) to return a single &quot;value&quot; rather
than a &quot;list&quot; of values. See also
&quot;context&quot; and &quot;list context&quot;. A scalar
context sometimes imposes additional constraints on the
return value--see &quot;string context&quot; and
&quot;numeric context&quot;. Sometimes we talk about a
&quot;Boolean context&quot; inside conditionals, but this
imposes no additional constraints, since any scalar value,
whether numeric or &quot;string&quot;, is already true or
false.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">scalar literal</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A number or quoted
&quot;string&quot;&minus;&minus;an actual &quot;value&quot;
in the text of your program, as opposed to a
&quot;variable&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">scalar value</p>

&quot;scalar&quot; as opposed to a &quot;list&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">scalar variable</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A &quot;variable&quot; prefixed
with <tt>&quot;$&quot;</tt> that holds a single value.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">scope</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">How far away you can see a
variable from, looking through one. Perl has two visibility
mechanisms: it does &quot;dynamic scoping&quot; of local
variables, meaning that the rest of the &quot;block&quot;,
and any subroutines that are called by the rest of the
block, can see the variables that are local to the block.
Perl does &quot;lexical scoping&quot; of my variables,
meaning that the rest of the block can see the variable, but
other subroutines called by the block <i>cannot</i> see the
variable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">scratchpad</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The area in which a particular
invocation of a particular file or subroutine keeps some of
its temporary values, including any lexically scoped
variables.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">script</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A text &quot;file&quot; that is
a program intended to be executed directly rather than
compiled to another form of file before execution. Also, in
the context of &quot;Unicode&quot;, a writing system for a
particular language or group of languages, such as Greek,
Bengali, or Klingon.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">script kiddie</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A &quot;cracker&quot; who is

<p style="margin-left:11%;">separator</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A &quot;character&quot; or
&quot;string&quot; that keeps two surrounding strings from
being confused with each other. The split function works on
separators. Not to be confused with delimiters or
terminators. The &quot;or&quot; in the previous sentence
separated the two alternatives.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">serialization</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Putting a fancy &quot;data

through a &quot;pipe&quot;. Also called marshalling.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">server</p>

and waits for clients who need service to get in touch with
it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">service</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Something you do for someone
else to make them happy, like giving them the time of day

are listed by the getservent function.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">setgid</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Same as &quot;setuid&quot;,
only having to do with giving away &quot;group&quot;
privileges.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">setuid</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Said of a program that runs
with the privileges of its &quot;owner&quot; rather than (as
is usually the case) the privileges of whoever is running
it. Also describes the bit in the mode word
(&quot;permission bits&quot;) that controls the feature.
This bit must be explicitly set by the owner to enable this
feature, and the program must be carefully written not to
give away more privileges than it ought to.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">shared memory</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A piece of &quot;memory&quot;
accessible by two different processes who otherwise would
not see each other&rsquo;s memory.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">shebang</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Irish for the whole
McGillicuddy. In Perl culture, a portmanteau of
&quot;sharp&quot; and &quot;bang&quot;, meaning the
<tt>&quot;#!&quot;</tt> sequence that tells the system where
to find the interpreter.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">shell</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A
&quot;command&quot;&minus;line &quot;interpreter&quot;. The
program that interactively gives you a prompt, accepts one
or more lines of input, and executes the programs you
mentioned, feeding each of them their proper arguments and
input data. Shells can also execute scripts containing such
commands. Under Unix, typical shells include the Bourne
shell (<i>/bin/sh</i>), the C shell (<i>/bin/csh</i>), and
the Korn shell (<i>/bin/ksh</i>). Perl is not strictly a
shell because it&rsquo;s not interactive (although Perl
programs can be interactive).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">side effects</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Something extra that happens
when you evaluate an &quot;expression&quot;. Nowadays it can
refer to almost anything. For example, evaluating a simple
assignment statement typically has the &quot;side
effect&quot; of assigning a value to a variable. (And you
thought assigning the value was your primary intent in the
first place!) Likewise, assigning a value to the special
variable <tt>$|</tt> (<tt>$AUTOFLUSH</tt>) has the side
effect of forcing a flush after every write or print on the
currently selected filehandle.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">signal</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A bolt out of the blue; that
is, an event triggered by the &quot;operating system&quot;,
probably when you&rsquo;re least expecting it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">signal handler</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A &quot;subroutine&quot; that,
instead of being content to be called in the normal fashion,
sits around waiting for a bolt out of the blue before it
will deign to &quot;execute&quot;. Under Perl, bolts out of
the blue are called signals, and you send them with the kill
built-in. See &quot;%SIG&quot; in perlvar and
&quot;Signals&quot; in perlipc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">single inheritance</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The features you got from your
mother, if she told you that you don&rsquo;t have a father.
(See also &quot;inheritance&quot; and &quot;multiple
inheritance&quot;.) In computer languages, the notion that
classes reproduce asexually so that a given class can only
have one direct ancestor or &quot;base class&quot;. Perl
supplies no such restriction, though you may certainly
program Perl that way if you like.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">slice</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A selection of any number of
elements from a &quot;list&quot;, &quot;array&quot;, or
&quot;hash&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">slurp</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">To read an entire
&quot;file&quot; into a &quot;string&quot; in one
operation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">socket</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">An endpoint for network
communication among multiple processes that works much like
a telephone or a post office box. The most important thing
about a socket is its &quot;network address&quot; (like a
phone number). Different kinds of sockets have different
kinds of addresses--some look like filenames, and some
don&rsquo;t.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">soft reference</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">See &quot;symbolic
reference&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">source filter</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A special kind of
&quot;module&quot; that does &quot;preprocessing&quot; on
your script just before it gets to the
&quot;tokener&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">stack</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A device you can put things on
the top of, and later take them back off in the opposite
order in which you put them on. See &quot;
<small>LIFO</small> &quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">standard</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Included in the official Perl
distribution, as in a standard module, a standard tool, or a
standard Perl &quot;manpage&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">standard error</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The default output
&quot;stream&quot; for nasty remarks that don&rsquo;t belong
in &quot;standard output&quot;. Represented within a Perl
program by the &quot;filehandle&quot; &quot;
<small>STDERR</small> &quot;. You can use this stream
explicitly, but the die and warn built-ins write to your
standard error stream automatically.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">standard I/O</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A standard C library for doing
buffered input and output to the &quot;operating
system&quot;. (The &quot;standard&quot; of standard I/O is
only marginally related to the &quot;standard&quot; of
standard input and output.) In general, Perl relies on
whatever implementation of standard I/O a given operating
system supplies, so the buffering characteristics of a Perl
program on one machine may not exactly match those on
another machine. Normally this only influences efficiency,
not semantics. If your standard I/O package is doing block
buffering and you want it to &quot;flush&quot; the buffer
more often, just set the <tt>$|</tt> variable to a true
value.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">standard input</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The default input
&quot;stream&quot; for your program, which if possible
shouldn&rsquo;t care where its data is coming from.
Represented within a Perl program by the
&quot;filehandle&quot; &quot; <small>STDIN</small>
&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">standard output</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The default output
&quot;stream&quot; for your program, which if possible
shouldn&rsquo;t care where its data is going. Represented
within a Perl program by the &quot;filehandle&quot; &quot;
<small>STDOUT</small> &quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">stat structure</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A special internal spot in
which Perl keeps the information about the last
&quot;file&quot; on which you requested information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">statement</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A &quot;command&quot; to the
computer about what to do next, like a step in a recipe:
&quot;Add marmalade to batter and mix until mixed.&quot; A
statement is distinguished from a &quot;declaration&quot;,
which doesn&rsquo;t tell the computer to do anything, but
just to learn something.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">statement modifier</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A &quot;conditional&quot; or
&quot;loop&quot; that you put after the
&quot;statement&quot; instead of before, if you know what we
mean.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">static</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Varying slowly compared to
something else. (Unfortunately, everything is relatively
stable compared to something else, except for certain
elementary particles, and we&rsquo;re not so sure about
them.) In computers, where things are supposed to vary
rapidly, &quot;static&quot; has a derogatory connotation,
indicating a slightly dysfunctional &quot;variable&quot;,
&quot;subroutine&quot;, or &quot;method&quot;. In Perl
culture, the word is politely avoided.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">static method</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">No such thing. See &quot;class
method&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">static scoping</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">No such thing. See
&quot;lexical scoping&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">static variable</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">No such thing. Just use a
&quot;lexical variable&quot; in a scope larger than your
&quot;subroutine&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">status</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The &quot;value&quot; returned
to the parent &quot;process&quot; when one of its child
processes dies. This value is placed in the special variable
<tt>$?</tt>. Its upper eight bits are the exit status of the
defunct process, and its lower eight bits identify the
signal (if any) that the process died from. On Unix systems,
this status value is the same as the status word returned by
<i>wait</i>(2). See &quot;system&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><small>STDERR</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">See &quot;standard
error&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">See &quot;standard
output&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">stream</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A flow of data into or out of a
process as a steady sequence of bytes or characters, without
the appearance of being broken up into packets. This is a
kind of &quot;interface&quot;&minus;&minus;the underlying
&quot;implementation&quot; may well break your data up into
separate packets for delivery, but this is hidden from
you.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">string</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A sequence of characters such
as &quot;He said !@#*&amp;%@#*?!&quot;. A string does not
have to be entirely printable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">string context</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The situation in which an
expression is expected by its surroundings (the code calling
it) to return a &quot;string&quot;. See also
&quot;context&quot; and &quot;numeric context&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">stringification</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The process of producing a
&quot;string&quot; representation of an abstract object.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">struct</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">C keyword introducing a
structure definition or name.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">structure</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">See &quot;data
structure&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">subclass</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">See &quot;derived
class&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">subpattern</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A component of a &quot;regular
expression&quot; pattern.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">subroutine</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A named or otherwise accessible
piece of program that can be invoked from elsewhere in the
program in order to accomplish some sub-goal of the program.
A subroutine is often parameterized to accomplish different
but related things depending on its input arguments. If the
subroutine returns a meaningful &quot;value&quot;, it is
also called a &quot;function&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">subscript</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A &quot;value&quot; that
indicates the position of a particular &quot;array&quot;
&quot;element&quot; in an array.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">substitution</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Changing parts of a string via
the <tt>&quot;s///&quot;</tt> operator. (We avoid use of
this term to mean &quot;variable interpolation&quot;.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">substring</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A portion of a
&quot;string&quot;, starting at a certain
&quot;character&quot; position (&quot;offset&quot;) and
proceeding for a certain number of characters.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">superclass</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">See &quot;base class&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">superuser</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The person whom the
&quot;operating system&quot; will let do almost anything.
Typically your system administrator or someone pretending to
be your system administrator. On Unix systems, the
&quot;root&quot; user. On Windows systems, usually the
Administrator user.</p>

Perl is passed around as a C language
<tt>&quot;SV*&quot;</tt> pointer. The <small>SV</small>

and the code is smart enough (we hope) not to try to call a

</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">switch</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">An option you give on a command
line to influence the way your program works, usually
introduced with a minus sign. The word is also used as a
nickname for a &quot;switch statement&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">switch cluster</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The combination of multiple
command-line switches (e.g., <b>&minus;a &minus;b
&minus;c</b>) into one switch (e.g., <b>&minus;abc</b>). Any
switch with an additional &quot;argument&quot; must be the
last switch in a cluster.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">switch statement</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A program technique that lets
you evaluate an &quot;expression&quot; and then, based on
the value of the expression, do a multiway branch to the
appropriate piece of code for that value. Also called a
&quot;case structure&quot;, named after the similar Pascal
construct. See See &quot;Basic BLOCKs&quot; in perlsyn.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">symbol</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Generally, any
&quot;token&quot; or &quot;metasymbol&quot;. Often used more
specifically to mean the sort of name you might find in a
&quot;symbol table&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">symbol table</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Where a &quot;compiler&quot;
remembers symbols. A program like Perl must somehow remember
all the names of all the variables, filehandles, and
subroutines you&rsquo;ve used. It does this by placing the
names in a symbol table, which is implemented in Perl using
a &quot;hash table&quot;. There is a separate symbol table
for each &quot;package&quot; to give each package its own
&quot;namespace&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">symbolic debugger</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A program that lets you step
through the execution of your program, stopping or printing
things out here and there to see whether anything has gone
wrong, and if so, what. The &quot;symbolic&quot; part just
means that you can talk to the debugger using the same
symbols with which your program is written.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">symbolic link</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">An alternate filename that
points to the real &quot;filename&quot;, which in turn
points to the real &quot;file&quot;. Whenever the
&quot;operating system&quot; is trying to parse a
&quot;pathname&quot; containing a symbolic link, it merely
substitutes the new name and continues parsing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">symbolic reference</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A variable whose value is the
name of another variable or subroutine. By dereferencing the
first variable, you can get at the second one. Symbolic
references are illegal under use strict
&rsquo;refs&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">synchronous</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Programming in which the
orderly sequence of events can be determined; that is, when
things happen one after the other, not at the same time.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">syntactic sugar</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">An alternative way of writing
something more easily; a shortcut.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">syntax</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">From Greek,
&quot;with-arrangement&quot;. How things (particularly
symbols) are put together with each other.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">syntax tree</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">An internal representation of
your program wherein lower-level constructs dangle off the
higher-level constructs enclosing them.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">syscall</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A &quot;function&quot; call
directly to the &quot;operating system&quot;. Many of the
important subroutines and functions you use aren&rsquo;t
direct system calls, but are built up in one or more layers
above the system call level. In general, Perl programmers
don&rsquo;t need to worry about the distinction. However, if
you do happen to know which Perl functions are really
syscalls, you can predict which of these will set the
<tt>$!</tt> (<tt>$ERRNO</tt>) variable on failure.
Unfortunately, beginning programmers often confusingly
employ the term &quot;system call&quot; to mean what happens
when you call the Perl system function, which actually
involves many syscalls. To avoid any confusion, we nearly
always use say &quot;syscall&quot; for something you could
call indirectly via Perl&rsquo;s syscall function, and never
for something you would call with Perl&rsquo;s system
function.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>T</b> <br>
tainted</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Said of data derived from the
grubby hands of a user and thus unsafe for a secure program
to rely on. Perl does taint checks if you run a
&quot;setuid&quot; (or &quot;setgid&quot;) program, or if
you use the <b>&minus;T</b> switch.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">term</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Short for a

tree&quot;. A thing that functions grammatically as an
&quot;operand&quot; for the operators in an expression.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">terminator</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A &quot;character&quot; or
&quot;string&quot; that marks the end of another string. The
<tt>$/</tt> variable contains the string that terminates a
readline operation, which chomp deletes from the end. Not to
be confused with delimiters or separators. The period at the
end of this sentence is a terminator.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">ternary</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">An &quot;operator&quot; taking
three operands. Sometimes pronounced
&quot;trinary&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">text</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A &quot;string&quot; or
&quot;file&quot; containing primarily printable
characters.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">thread</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Like a forked process, but
without &quot;fork&quot;&rsquo;s inherent memory protection.
A thread is lighter weight than a full process, in that a
process could have multiple threads running around in it,
all fighting over the same process&rsquo;s memory space
unless steps are taken to protect threads from each other.

<p style="margin-left:17%;">There&rsquo;s More Than One Way
To Do It, the Perl Motto. The notion that there can be more

better or that all possible paths are equally
desirable--just that there need not be One True Way.)

<p style="margin-left:11%;">tokenizing</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Splitting up a program text
into tokens. Also known as &quot;lexing&quot;, in which case
you get &quot;lexemes&quot; instead of tokens.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">toolbox approach</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The notion that, with a
complete set of simple tools that work well together, you
can build almost anything you want. Which is fine if
you&rsquo;re assembling a tricycle, but if you&rsquo;re
building a defranishizing comboflux regurgalator, you really
want your own machine shop in which to build special tools.
Perl is sort of a machine shop.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">transliterate</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">To turn one string
representation into another by mapping each character of the

language think it&rsquo;s easy to learn because it&rsquo;s
so easily twisted to one&rsquo;s own ends, but dialectical
differences make tribal intercommunication nearly
impossible, and travelers are often reduced to a pidgin-like
subset of the language. To be universally understood, a Unix
shell programmer must spend years of study in the art. Many
have abandoned this discipline and now communicate via an
Esperanto-like language called Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">In ancient
times, Unix was also used to refer to some code that a
couple of people at Bell Labs wrote to make use of a
<small>PDP&minus;7</small> computer that wasn&rsquo;t doing
much of anything else at the time.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>V</b> <br>
value</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">An actual piece of data, in
contrast to all the variables, references, keys, indexes,
operators, and whatnot that you need to access the
value.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">variable</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A named storage location that
can hold any of various kinds of &quot;value&quot;, as your
program sees fit.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">variable interpolation</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The &quot;interpolation&quot;
of a scalar or array variable into a string.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">variadic</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Said of a &quot;function&quot;
that happily receives an indeterminate number of
&quot;actual arguments&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">vector</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Mathematical jargon for a list
of scalar values.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">virtual</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Providing the appearance of
something without the reality, as in: virtual memory is not
real memory. (See also &quot;memory&quot;.) The opposite of
&quot;virtual&quot; is &quot;transparent&quot;, which means
providing the reality of something without the appearance,
as in: Perl handles the variable-length
<small>UTF&minus;8</small> character encoding
transparently.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">void context</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A form of &quot;scalar
context&quot; in which an &quot;expression&quot; is not
expected to return any &quot;value&quot; at all and is
evaluated for its &quot;side effects&quot; alone.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">v&minus;string</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A &quot;version&quot; or
&quot;vector&quot; &quot;string&quot; specified with a
<tt>&quot;v&quot;</tt> followed by a series of decimal
integers in dot notation, for instance,
<tt>&quot;v1.20.300.4000&quot;</tt>. Each number turns into
a &quot;character&quot; with the specified ordinal value.
(The <tt>&quot;v&quot;</tt> is optional when there are at
least three integers.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>W</b> <br>
warning</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A message printed to the &quot;
<small>STDERR</small> &quot; stream to the effect that
something might be wrong but isn&rsquo;t worth blowing up
over. See &quot;warn&quot; in perlfunc and the warnings
pragma.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">watch expression</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">An expression which, when its
value changes, causes a breakpoint in the Perl debugger.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">whitespace</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A &quot;character&quot; that
moves your cursor but doesn&rsquo;t otherwise put anything
on your screen. Typically refers to any of: space, tab, line
feed, carriage return, or form feed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">word</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">In normal
&quot;computerese&quot;, the piece of data of the size most
efficiently handled by your computer, typically 32 bits or
so, give or take a few powers of 2. In Perl culture, it more
often refers to an alphanumeric &quot;identifier&quot;
(including underscores), or to a string of nonwhitespace
characters bounded by whitespace or string boundaries.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">working directory</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Your current
&quot;directory&quot;, from which relative pathnames are
interpreted by the &quot;operating system&quot;. The
operating system knows your current directory because you
told it with a chdir or because you started out in the place
where your parent &quot;process&quot; was when you were
born.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">wrapper</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A program or subroutine that
runs some other program or subroutine for you, modifying
some of its input or output to better suit your
purposes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><small>WYSIWYG</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">What You See Is What You Get.
Usually used when something that appears on the screen
matches how it will eventually look, like Perl&rsquo;s
format declarations. Also used to mean the opposite of magic
because everything works exactly as it appears, as in the
three-argument form of open.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>X</b></p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p><small>XS</small></p></td>
<td width="3%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>A language to extend Perl with C and C <small>++</small>
. <small>XS</small> is an interface description file format
used to create an extension interface between Perl and C
code (or a C library) which one wishes to use with Perl. See
perlxs for the exact explanation or read the perlxstut
tutorial.</p> </td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><small>XSUB</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">An external
&quot;subroutine&quot; defined in &quot; <small>XS</small>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Y</b> <br>
yacc</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Yet Another Compiler Compiler.
A parser generator without which Perl probably would not
have existed. See the file <i>perly.y</i> in the Perl source
distribution.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Z</b> <br>
zero width</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A subpattern
&quot;assertion&quot; matching the &quot;null string&quot;
between characters.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">zombie</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A process that has died
(exited) but whose parent has not yet received proper
notification of its demise by virtue of having called wait
or waitpid. If you fork, you must clean up after your child
processes when they exit, or else the process table will
fill up and your system administrator will Not Be Happy with
you.</p>
