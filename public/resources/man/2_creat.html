<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Given a
<i>pathname</i> for a file, <b>open</b>() returns a file
descriptor, a small, nonnegative integer for use in
subsequent system calls (<b>read</b>(2), <b>write</b>(2),
<b>lseek</b>(2), <b>fcntl</b>(2), etc.). The file descriptor
returned by a successful call will be the lowest-numbered
file descriptor not currently open for the process.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">By default, the
new file descriptor is set to remain open across an
<b>execve</b>(2) (i.e., the <b>FD_CLOEXEC</b> file
descriptor flag described in <b>fcntl</b>(2) is initially
disabled; the <b>O_CLOEXEC</b> flag, described below, can be
used to change this default). The file offset is set to the
beginning of the file (see <b>lseek</b>(2)).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A call to
<b>open</b>() creates a new <i>open file description</i>, an
entry in the system-wide table of open files. This entry
records the file offset and the file status flags
(modifiable via the <b>fcntl</b>(2) <b>F_SETFL</b>
operation). A file descriptor is a reference to one of these
entries; this reference is unaffected if <i>pathname</i> is
subsequently removed or modified to refer to a different
file. The new open file description is initially not shared
with any other process, but sharing may arise via
<b>fork</b>(2).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The argument
<i>flags</i> must include one of the following <i>access
modes</i>: <b>O_RDONLY</b>, <b>O_WRONLY</b>, or
<b>O_RDWR</b>. These request opening the file read-only,
write-only, or read/write, respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In addition,
zero or more file creation flags and file status flags can
be bitwise-<i>or</i>&rsquo;d in <i>flags</i>. The <i>file
creation flags</i> are <b>O_CLOEXEC</b>, <b>O_CREAT</b>,
<b>O_DIRECTORY</b>, <b>O_EXCL</b>, <b>O_NOCTTY</b>,
<b>O_NOFOLLOW</b>, <b>O_TRUNC</b>, and <b>O_TTY_INIT</b>.
The <i>file status flags</i> are all of the remaining flags
listed below. The distinction between these two groups of
flags is that the file status flags can be retrieved and (in
some cases) modified using <b>fcntl</b>(2). The full list of
file creation flags and file status flags is as follows:
<b><br>
O_APPEND</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The file is opened in append
mode. Before each <b>write</b>(2), the file offset is
positioned at the end of the file, as if with
<b>lseek</b>(2). <b>O_APPEND</b> may lead to corrupted files
on NFS file systems if more than one process appends data to
a file at once. This is because NFS does not support
appending to a file, so the client kernel has to simulate
it, which can&rsquo;t be done without a race condition.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>O_ASYNC</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Enable signal-driven I/O:
generate a signal (<b>SIGIO</b> by default, but this can be
changed via <b>fcntl</b>(2)) when input or output becomes
possible on this file descriptor. This feature is available
only for terminals, pseudoterminals, sockets, and (since
Linux 2.6) pipes and FIFOs. See <b>fcntl</b>(2) for further
details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>O_CLOEXEC</b> (Since Linux
2.6.23)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Enable the close-on-exec flag
for the new file descriptor. Specifying this flag permits a
program to avoid additional <b>fcntl</b>(2) <b>F_SETFD</b>
operations to set the <b>FD_CLOEXEC</b> flag. Additionally,
use of this flag is essential in some multithreaded programs
since using a separate <b>fcntl</b>(2) <b>F_SETFD</b>
operation to set the <b>FD_CLOEXEC</b> flag does not suffice
to avoid race conditions where one thread opens a file
descriptor at the same time as another thread does a
<b>fork</b>(2) plus <b>execve</b>(2).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>O_CREAT</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If the file does not exist it
will be created. The owner (user ID) of the file is set to
the effective user ID of the process. The group ownership
(group ID) is set either to the effective group ID of the
process or to the group ID of the parent directory
(depending on file system type and mount options, and the
mode of the parent directory, see the mount options
<i>bsdgroups</i> and <i>sysvgroups</i> described in
<b>mount</b>(8)).</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><i>mode</i>
specifies the permissions to use in case a new file is
created. This argument must be supplied when <b>O_CREAT</b>
is specified in <i>flags</i>; if <b>O_CREAT</b> is not
specified, then <i>mode</i> is ignored. The effective
permissions are modified by the process&rsquo;s <i>umask</i>
in the usual way: The permissions of the created file are
<i>(mode&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;~umask)</i>. Note that this mode
applies only to future accesses of the newly created file;
the <b>open</b>() call that creates a read-only file may
well return a read/write file descriptor.</p>

symbolic constants are provided for <i>mode</i>:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>O_DIRECT</b> (Since Linux
2.4.10)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Try to minimize cache effects
of the I/O to and from this file. In general this will
degrade performance, but it is useful in special situations,
such as when applications do their own caching. File I/O is
done directly to/from user-space buffers. The
<b>O_DIRECT</b> flag on its own makes an effort to transfer
data synchronously, but does not give the guarantees of the
<b>O_SYNC</b> flag that data and necessary metadata are
transferred. To guarantee synchronous I/O, <b>O_SYNC</b>
must be used in addition to <b>O_DIRECT</b>. See NOTES below
for further discussion.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">A semantically
similar (but deprecated) interface for block devices is
described in <b>raw</b>(8).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>O_DIRECTORY</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If <i>pathname</i> is not a
directory, cause the open to fail. This flag is
Linux-specific, and was added in kernel version 2.1.126, to
avoid denial-of-service problems if <b>opendir</b>(3) is
called on a FIFO or tape device.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"

<td width="78%">


<p>Ensure that this call creates the file: if this flag is
specified in conjunction with <b>O_CREAT</b>, and
<i>pathname</i> already exists, then <b>open</b>() will
fail.</p> </td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">When these two
flags are specified, symbolic links are not followed: if
<i>pathname</i> is a symbolic link, then <b>open</b>() fails
regardless of where the symbolic link points to.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">In general, the
behavior of <b>O_EXCL</b> is undefined if it is used without
<b>O_CREAT</b>. There is one exception: on Linux 2.6 and
later, <b>O_EXCL</b> can be used without <b>O_CREAT</b> if
<i>pathname</i> refers to a block device. If the block
device is in use by the system (e.g., mounted),
<b>open</b>() fails with the error <b>EBUSY</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">On NFS,
<b>O_EXCL</b> is supported only when using NFSv3 or later on
kernel 2.6 or later. In NFS environments where <b>O_EXCL</b>
support is not provided, programs that rely on it for
performing locking tasks will contain a race condition.
Portable programs that want to perform atomic file locking
using a lockfile, and need to avoid reliance on NFS support
for <b>O_EXCL</b>, can create a unique file on the same file
system (e.g., incorporating hostname and PID), and use
<b>link</b>(2) to make a link to the lockfile. If
<b>link</b>(2) returns 0, the lock is successful. Otherwise,
use <b>stat</b>(2) on the unique file to check if its link
count has increased to 2, in which case the lock is also
successful.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>O_LARGEFILE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">(LFS) Allow files whose sizes
cannot be represented in an <i>off_t</i> (but can be
represented in an <i>off64_t</i>) to be opened. The
<b>_LARGEFILE64_SOURCE</b> macro must be defined (before
including <i>any</i> header files) in order to obtain this
definition. Setting the <b>_FILE_OFFSET_BITS</b> feature
test macro to 64 (rather than using <b>O_LARGEFILE</b>) is
the preferred method of accessing large files on 32-bit
systems (see <b>feature_test_macros</b>(7)).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>O_NOATIME</b> (Since Linux
2.6.8)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Do not update the file last
access time (<i>st_atime</i> in the inode) when the file is
<b>read</b>(2). This flag is intended for use by indexing or
backup programs, where its use can significantly reduce the
amount of disk activity. This flag may not be effective on
all file systems. One example is NFS, where the server
maintains the access time.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>O_NOCTTY</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If <i>pathname</i> refers to a
terminal device&mdash;see <b>tty</b>(4)&mdash;it will not
become the process&rsquo;s controlling terminal even if the
process does not have one.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>O_NOFOLLOW</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If <i>pathname</i> is a
symbolic link, then the open fails. This is a FreeBSD
extension, which was added to Linux in version 2.1.126.
Symbolic links in earlier components of the pathname will
still be followed. See also <b>O_NOPATH</b> below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>O_NONBLOCK</b> or
<b>O_NDELAY</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">When possible, the file is
opened in nonblocking mode. Neither the <b>open</b>() nor
any subsequent operations on the file descriptor which is
returned will cause the calling process to wait. For the
handling of FIFOs (named pipes), see also <b>fifo</b>(7).
For a discussion of the effect of <b>O_NONBLOCK</b> in
conjunction with mandatory file locks and with file leases,
see <b>fcntl</b>(2).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>O_PATH</b> (since Linux
2.6.39)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Obtain a file descriptor that
can be used for two purposes: to indicate a location in the
file-system tree and to perform operations that act purely
at the file descriptor level. The file itself is not opened,
and other file operations (e.g., <b>read</b>(2),
<b>write</b>(2), <b>fchmod</b>(2), <b>fchown</b>(2),
<b>fgetxattr</b>(2)) fail with the error <b>EBADF</b>.</p>

<h2>NOTES
<a name="NOTES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Under Linux,
the <b>O_NONBLOCK</b> flag indicates that one wants to open
but does not necessarily have the intention to read or
write. This is typically used to open devices in order to
get a file descriptor for use with <b>ioctl</b>(2).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Unlike the
other values that can be specified in <i>flags</i>, the
<i>access mode</i> values <b>O_RDONLY</b>, <b>O_WRONLY</b>,
and <b>O_RDWR</b>, do not specify individual bits. Rather,
they define the low order two bits of <i>flags</i>, and are
defined respectively as 0, 1, and 2. In other words, the
combination <b>O_RDONLY | O_WRONLY</b> is a logical error,
and certainly does not have the same meaning as
<b>O_RDWR</b>. Linux reserves the special, nonstandard
access mode 3 (binary 11) in <i>flags</i> to mean: check for
read and write permission on the file and return a
descriptor that can&rsquo;t be used for reading or writing.
This nonstandard access mode is used by some Linux drivers
to return a descriptor that is to be used only for
device-specific <b>ioctl</b>(2) operations.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The (undefined)
effect of <b>O_RDONLY | O_TRUNC</b> varies among
implementations. On many systems the file is actually
truncated.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There are many
infelicities in the protocol underlying NFS, affecting
amongst others <b>O_SYNC</b> and <b>O_NDELAY</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">POSIX provides
for three different variants of synchronized I/O,
corresponding to the flags <b>O_SYNC</b>, <b>O_DSYNC</b>,
and <b>O_RSYNC</b>. Currently (2.6.31), Linux implements
only <b>O_SYNC</b>, but glibc maps <b>O_DSYNC</b> and
<b>O_RSYNC</b> to the same numerical value as <b>O_SYNC</b>.
Most Linux file systems don&rsquo;t actually implement the
POSIX <b>O_SYNC</b> semantics, which require all metadata
updates of a write to be on disk on returning to user space,
but only the <b>O_DSYNC</b> semantics, which require only
actual file data and metadata necessary to retrieve it to be
on disk by the time the system call returns.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
<b>open</b>() can open device special files, but
<b>creat</b>() cannot create them; use <b>mknod</b>(2)
instead.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On NFS file
systems with UID mapping enabled, <b>open</b>() may return a
file descriptor but, for example, <b>read</b>(2) requests
are denied with <b>EACCES</b>. This is because the client
performs <b>open</b>() by checking the permissions, but UID
mapping is performed by the server upon read and write
requests.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the file is
newly created, its <i>st_atime</i>, <i>st_ctime</i>,
<i>st_mtime</i> fields (respectively, time of last access,
time of last status change, and time of last modification;
see <b>stat</b>(2)) are set to the current time, and so are
the <i>st_ctime</i> and <i>st_mtime</i> fields of the parent
directory. Otherwise, if the file is modified because of the
<b>O_TRUNC</b> flag, its st_ctime and st_mtime fields are
set to the current time.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>O_DIRECT</b>
<br>
The <b>O_DIRECT</b> flag may impose alignment restrictions
on the length and address of user-space buffers and the file
offset of I/Os. In Linux alignment restrictions vary by file
system and kernel version and might be absent entirely.
However there is currently no file system&minus;independent
interface for an application to discover these restrictions
for a given file or file system. Some file systems provide
their own interfaces for doing so, for example the
<b>XFS_IOC_DIOINFO</b> operation in <b>xfsctl</b>(3).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Under Linux
2.4, transfer sizes, and the alignment of the user buffer
and the file offset must all be multiples of the logical
block size of the file system. Under Linux 2.6, alignment to
512-byte boundaries suffices.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>O_DIRECT</b>
I/Os should never be run concurrently with the
<b>fork</b>(2) system call, if the memory buffer is a
private mapping (i.e., any mapping created with the
<b>mmap</b>(2) <b>MAP_PRIVATE</b> flag; this includes memory
allocated on the heap and statically allocated buffers). Any
such I/Os, whether submitted via an asynchronous I/O
interface or from another thread in the process, should be
completed before <b>fork</b>(2) is called. Failure to do so
can result in data corruption and undefined behavior in
parent and child processes. This restriction does not apply
when the memory buffer for the <b>O_DIRECT</b> I/Os was
created using <b>shmat</b>(2) or <b>mmap</b>(2) with the
<b>MAP_SHARED</b> flag. Nor does this restriction apply when
the memory buffer has been advised as <b>MADV_DONTFORK</b>
with <b>madvise</b>(2), ensuring that it will not be
available to the child after <b>fork</b>(2).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>O_DIRECT</b> flag was introduced in SGI IRIX, where it
has alignment restrictions similar to those of Linux 2.4.
IRIX has also a <b>fcntl</b>(2) call to query appropriate
alignments, and sizes. FreeBSD 4.x introduced a flag of the
same name, but without alignment restrictions.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>O_DIRECT</b>
support was added under Linux in kernel version 2.4.10.
Older Linux kernels simply ignore this flag. Some file
systems may not implement the flag and <b>open</b>() will
fail with <b>EINVAL</b> if it is used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Applications
should avoid mixing <b>O_DIRECT</b> and normal I/O to the
same file, and especially to overlapping byte regions in the
same file. Even when the file system correctly handles the
coherency issues in this situation, overall I/O throughput
is likely to be slower than using either mode alone.
Likewise, applications should avoid mixing <b>mmap</b>(2) of
files with direct I/O to the same files.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The behaviour
of <b>O_DIRECT</b> with NFS will differ from local file
systems. Older kernels, or kernels configured in certain
ways, may not support this combination. The NFS protocol
does not support passing the flag to the server, so
<b>O_DIRECT</b> I/O will bypass the page cache only on the
client; the server may still cache the I/O. The client asks
the server to make the I/O synchronous to preserve the
synchronous semantics of <b>O_DIRECT</b>. Some servers will
perform poorly under these circumstances, especially if the
I/O size is small. Some servers may also be configured to
lie to clients about the I/O having reached stable storage;
this will avoid the performance penalty at some risk to data
integrity in the event of server power failure. The Linux
NFS client places no alignment restrictions on
<b>O_DIRECT</b> I/O.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In summary,
<b>O_DIRECT</b> is a potentially powerful tool that should
be used with caution. It is recommended that applications
treat use of <b>O_DIRECT</b> as a performance option which
is disabled by default.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;The thing
that has always disturbed me about O_DIRECT is that the
whole interface is just stupid, and was probably designed by
a deranged monkey on some serious mind-controlling
substances.&quot;&mdash;Linus</p>
