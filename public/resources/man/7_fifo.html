first-in first-out special file, named pipe</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A FIFO special
file (a named pipe) is similar to a pipe, except that it is
accessed as part of the file system. It can be opened by
multiple processes for reading or writing. When processes
are exchanging data via the FIFO, the kernel passes all data
internally without writing it to the file system. Thus, the
FIFO special file has no contents on the file system; the
file system entry merely serves as a reference point so that
processes can access the pipe using a name in the file
system.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The kernel
maintains exactly one pipe object for each FIFO special file
that is opened by at least one process. The FIFO must be
opened on both ends (reading and writing) before data can be
passed. Normally, opening the FIFO blocks until the other
end is opened also.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A process can
open a FIFO in nonblocking mode. In this case, opening for
read-only will succeed even if no-one has opened on the
write side yet, opening for write-only will fail with
<b>ENXIO</b> (no such device or address) unless the other
end has already been opened.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Under Linux,
opening a FIFO for read and write will succeed both in
blocking and nonblocking mode. POSIX leaves this behavior
undefined. This can be used to open a FIFO for writing while
there are no readers available. A process that uses both
ends of the connection in order to communicate with itself
should be very careful to avoid deadlocks.</p>

<h2>NOTES
<a name="NOTES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When a process
tries to write to a FIFO that is not opened for read on the
other side, the process is sent a <b>SIGPIPE</b> signal.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">FIFO special
files can be created by <b>mkfifo</b>(3), and are indicated
by <i>ls &minus;l</i> with the file type 'p'.</p>
