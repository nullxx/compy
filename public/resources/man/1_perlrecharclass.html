&minus; Perl Regular Expression Character Classes</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The top level
documentation about Perl regular expressions is found in
perlre.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This manual
page discusses the syntax and use of character classes in
Perl regular expressions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A character
class is a way of denoting a set of characters in such a way
that one character of the set is matched. It&rsquo;s
important to remember that: matching a character class
consumes exactly one character in the source string. (The
source string is the string the regular expression is
matched against.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There are three
types of character classes in Perl regular expressions: the
dot, backslash sequences, and the form enclosed in square
brackets. Keep in mind, though, that often the term
&quot;character class&quot; is used to mean just the
bracketed form. Certainly, most Perl documentation does
that.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>The dot</b>
<br>
The dot (or period), <tt>&quot;.&quot;</tt> is probably the
most used, and certainly the most well-known character
class. By default, a dot matches any character, except for
the newline. That default can be changed to add matching the
newline by using the <i>single line</i> modifier: either for
the entire regular expression with the
<tt>&quot;/s&quot;</tt> modifier, or locally with
<tt>&quot;(?s)&quot;</tt>. (The experimental
<tt>&quot;\N&quot;</tt> backslash sequence, described below,
matches any character except newline without regard to the
<i>single line</i> modifier.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Here are some
examples:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"> &quot;a&quot;  =~  /./       # Match
 &quot;.&quot;  =~  /./       # Match
 &quot;&quot;   =~  /./       # No match (dot has to match a character)
 &quot;\n&quot; =~  /./       # No match (dot does not match a newline)
 &quot;\n&quot; =~  /./s      # Match (global 'single line' modifier)
 &quot;\n&quot; =~  /(?s:.)/  # Match (local 'single line' modifier)
 &quot;ab&quot; =~  /^.$/     # No match (dot matches one character)</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Backslash
sequences</b> <br>
A backslash sequence is a sequence of characters, the first
one of which is a backslash. Perl ascribes special meaning
to many such sequences, and some of these are character
classes. That is, they match a single character each,
provided that the character belongs to the specific set of
characters defined by the sequence.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Here&rsquo;s a
list of the backslash sequences that are character classes.
They are discussed in more detail below. (For the backslash
sequences that aren&rsquo;t character classes, see
perlrebackslash.)</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"> \d             Match a decimal digit character.
 \D             Match a non&minus;decimal&minus;digit character.
 \w             Match a &quot;word&quot; character.
 \W             Match a non&minus;&quot;word&quot; character.
 \s             Match a whitespace character.
 \S             Match a non&minus;whitespace character.
 \h             Match a horizontal whitespace character.
 \H             Match a character that isn't horizontal whitespace.
 \v             Match a vertical whitespace character.
 \V             Match a character that isn't vertical whitespace.
 \N             Match a character that isn't a newline.  Experimental.
 \pP, \p{Prop}  Match a character that has the given Unicode property.
 \PP, \P{Prop}  Match a character that doesn't have the Unicode property</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>\N</i></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><tt>&quot;\N&quot;</tt>
is new in 5.12, and is experimental. It, like the dot,
matches any character that is not a newline. The difference
is that <tt>&quot;\N&quot;</tt> is not influenced by the
<i>single line</i> regular expression modifier (see
&quot;The dot&quot; above). Note that the form
<tt>&quot;\N{...}&quot;</tt> may mean something completely
different. When the <tt>&quot;{...}&quot;</tt> is a
quantifier, it means to match a non-newline character that
many times. For example, <tt>&quot;\N{3}&quot;</tt> means to
match 3 non-newlines; <tt>&quot;\N{5,}&quot;</tt> means to
match 5 or more non-newlines. But if
<tt>&quot;{...}&quot;</tt> is not a legal quantifier, it is
presumed to be a named character. See charnames for those.
For example, none of <tt>&quot;\N{COLON}&quot;</tt>,
<tt>&quot;\N{4F}&quot;</tt>, and <tt>&quot;\N{F4}&quot;</tt>
contain legal quantifiers, so Perl will try to find
characters whose names are respectively
<tt>&quot;COLON&quot;</tt>, <tt>&quot;4F&quot;</tt>, and
<tt>&quot;F4&quot;</tt>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Digits</i></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><tt>&quot;\d&quot;</tt>
matches a single character considered to be a decimal
<i>digit</i>. If the <tt>&quot;/a&quot;</tt> regular
expression modifier is in effect, it matches [0&minus;9].
Otherwise, it matches anything that is matched by
<tt>&quot;\p{Digit}&quot;</tt>, which includes [0&minus;9].
(An unlikely possible exception is that under locale
matching rules, the current locale might not have
[0&minus;9] matched by <tt>&quot;\d&quot;</tt>, and/or might
match other characters whose code point is less than 256.
Such a locale definition would be in violation of the C
language standard, but Perl doesn&rsquo;t currently assume
anything in regard to this.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">What this means
is that unless the <tt>&quot;/a&quot;</tt> modifier is in
effect <tt>&quot;\d&quot;</tt> not only matches the digits
&rsquo;0&rsquo; &minus; &rsquo;9&rsquo;, but also Arabic,
Devanagari, and digits from other languages. This may cause
some confusion, and some security issues.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Some digits
that <tt>&quot;\d&quot;</tt> matches look like some of the
[0&minus;9] ones, but have different values. For example,
<small>BENGALI DIGIT FOUR</small> (U+09EA) looks very much
like an <small>ASCII DIGIT EIGHT</small> (U+0038). An
application that is expecting only the <small>ASCII</small>
digits might be misled, or if the match is
<tt>&quot;\d+&quot;</tt>, the matched string might contain a
mixture of digits from different writing systems that look
like they signify a number different than they actually do.
&quot;<i>num()</i>&quot; in Unicode::UCD can be used to
safely calculate the value, returning
<tt>&quot;undef&quot;</tt> if the input string contains such
a mixture.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">What
<tt>&quot;\p{Digit}&quot;</tt> means (and hence
<tt>&quot;\d&quot;</tt> except under the
<tt>&quot;/a&quot;</tt> modifier) is
<tt>&quot;\p{General_Category=Decimal_Number}&quot;</tt>, or
synonymously,
<tt>&quot;\p{General_Category=Digit}&quot;</tt>. Starting
with Unicode version 4.1, this is the same set of characters
matched by <tt>&quot;\p{Numeric_Type=Decimal}&quot;</tt>.
But Unicode also has a different property with a similar
name, <tt>&quot;\p{Numeric_Type=Digit}&quot;</tt>, which
matches a completely different set of characters. These
characters are things such as <tt>&quot;CIRCLED DIGIT
ONE&quot;</tt> or subscripts, or are from writing systems
that lack all ten digits.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The design
intent is for <tt>&quot;\d&quot;</tt> to exactly match the
set of characters that can safely be used with
&quot;normal&quot; big-endian positional decimal syntax,
where, for example 123 means one &rsquo;hundred&rsquo;, plus
two &rsquo;tens&rsquo;, plus three &rsquo;ones&rsquo;. This
positional notation does not necessarily apply to characters
that match the other type of &quot;digit&quot;,
<tt>&quot;\p{Numeric_Type=Digit}&quot;</tt>, and so
<tt>&quot;\d&quot;</tt> doesn&rsquo;t match them.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The Tamil
digits (U+0BE6 &minus; U+0BEF) can also legally be used in
old-style Tamil numbers in which they would appear no more
than one in a row, separated by characters that mean
&quot;times 10&quot;, &quot;times 100&quot;, etc. (See
&lt;http://www.unicode.org/notes/tn21&gt;.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Any character
not matched by <tt>&quot;\d&quot;</tt> is matched by
<tt>&quot;\D&quot;</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Word
characters</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A
<tt>&quot;\w&quot;</tt> matches a single alphanumeric
character (an alphabetic character, or a decimal digit) or a
connecting punctuation character, such as an underscore
(&quot;_&quot;). It does not match a whole word. To match a
whole word, use <tt>&quot;\w+&quot;</tt>. This isn&rsquo;t
the same thing as matching an English word, but in the
<small>ASCII</small> range it is the same as a string of
Perl-identifier characters. <br>
If the &quot;/a&quot; modifier is in effect ...</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><tt>&quot;\w&quot;</tt> matches
the 63 characters [a&minus;zA&minus;Z0&minus;9_].</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">otherwise ...</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">For code points above 255
...</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;"><tt>&quot;\w&quot;</tt> matches
the same as <tt>&quot;\p{Word}&quot;</tt> matches in this
range. That is, it matches Thai letters, Greek letters, etc.
This includes connector punctuation (like the underscore)
which connect two words together, or diacritics, such as a
<tt>&quot;COMBINING TILDE&quot;</tt> and the modifier
letters, which are generally used to add auxiliary markings
to letters.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">For code points below 256
...</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">if locale rules are in effect
...</p>

<p style="margin-left:29%;"><tt>&quot;\w&quot;</tt> matches
the platform&rsquo;s native underscore character plus
whatever the locale considers to be alphanumeric.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">if Unicode rules are in effect
or if on an <small>EBCDIC</small> platform ...</p>

<p style="margin-left:29%;"><tt>&quot;\w&quot;</tt> matches
exactly what <tt>&quot;\p{Word}&quot;</tt> matches.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">otherwise ...</p>

<p style="margin-left:29%;"><tt>&quot;\w&quot;</tt> matches
[a&minus;zA&minus;Z0&minus;9_].</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Which rules
apply are determined as described in &quot;Which character
set modifier is in effect?&quot; in perlre.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There are a
number of security issues with the full Unicode list of word
characters. See &lt;http://unicode.org/reports/tr36&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Also, for a
somewhat finer-grained set of characters that are in
programming language identifiers beyond the
<small>ASCII</small> range, you may wish to instead use the
more customized &quot;Unicode Properties&quot;,
<tt>&quot;\p{ID_Start}&quot;</tt>,
<tt>&quot;\p{ID_Continue}&quot;</tt>,
<tt>&quot;\p{XID_Start}&quot;</tt>, and
<tt>&quot;\p{XID_Continue}&quot;</tt>. See
&lt;http://unicode.org/reports/tr31&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Any character
not matched by <tt>&quot;\w&quot;</tt> is matched by
<tt>&quot;\W&quot;</tt>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Whitespace</i></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><tt>&quot;\s&quot;</tt>
matches any single character considered whitespace. <br>
If the &quot;/a&quot; modifier is in effect ...</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><tt>&quot;\s&quot;</tt> matches
the 5 characters [\t\n\f\r ]; that is, the horizontal tab,
the newline, the form feed, the carriage return, and the
space. (Note that it doesn&rsquo;t match the vertical tab,
<tt>&quot;\cK&quot;</tt> on <small>ASCII</small>
platforms.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">otherwise ...</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">For code points above 255
...</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;"><tt>&quot;\s&quot;</tt> matches
exactly the code points above 255 shown with an
&quot;s&quot; column in the table below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">For code points below 256
...</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">if locale rules are in effect
...</p>

<p style="margin-left:29%;"><tt>&quot;\s&quot;</tt> matches
whatever the locale considers to be whitespace. Note that
this is likely to include the vertical space, unlike
non-locale <tt>&quot;\s&quot;</tt> matching.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">if Unicode rules are in effect
or if on an <small>EBCDIC</small> platform ...</p>

<p style="margin-left:29%;"><tt>&quot;\s&quot;</tt> matches
exactly the characters shown with an &quot;s&quot; column in
the table below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">otherwise ...</p>

<p style="margin-left:29%;"><tt>&quot;\s&quot;</tt> matches
[\t\n\f\r ]. Note that this list doesn&rsquo;t include the
non-breaking space.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Which rules
apply are determined as described in &quot;Which character
set modifier is in effect?&quot; in perlre.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Any character
not matched by <tt>&quot;\s&quot;</tt> is matched by
<tt>&quot;\S&quot;</tt>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><tt>&quot;\h&quot;</tt>
matches any character considered horizontal whitespace; this
includes the platform&rsquo;s space and tab characters and
several others listed in the table below.
<tt>&quot;\H&quot;</tt> matches any character not considered
horizontal whitespace. They use the platform&rsquo;s native
character set, and do not consider any locale that may
otherwise be in use.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><tt>&quot;\v&quot;</tt>
matches any character considered vertical whitespace; this
includes the platform&rsquo;s carriage return and line feed
characters (newline) plus several other characters, all
listed in the table below. <tt>&quot;\V&quot;</tt> matches
any character not considered vertical whitespace. They use
the platform&rsquo;s native character set, and do not
consider any locale that may otherwise be in use.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><tt>&quot;\R&quot;</tt>
matches anything that can be considered a newline under
Unicode rules. It&rsquo;s not a character class, as it can
match a multi-character sequence. Therefore, it cannot be
used inside a bracketed character class; use
<tt>&quot;\v&quot;</tt> instead (vertical whitespace). It
uses the platform&rsquo;s native character set, and does not
consider any locale that may otherwise be in use. Details
are discussed in perlrebackslash.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
unlike <tt>&quot;\s&quot;</tt> (and <tt>&quot;\d&quot;</tt>
and <tt>&quot;\w&quot;</tt>), <tt>&quot;\h&quot;</tt> and
<tt>&quot;\v&quot;</tt> always match the same characters,
without regard to other factors, such as the active locale
or whether the source string is in
<small>UTF&minus;8</small> format.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">One might think
that <tt>&quot;\s&quot;</tt> is equivalent to
<tt>&quot;[\h\v]&quot;</tt>. This is not true. The
difference is that the vertical tab
(<tt>&quot;\x0b&quot;</tt>) is not matched by
<tt>&quot;\s&quot;</tt>; it is however considered vertical
whitespace.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
table is a complete listing of characters matched by
<tt>&quot;\s&quot;</tt>, <tt>&quot;\h&quot;</tt> and
<tt>&quot;\v&quot;</tt> as of Unicode 6.0.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The first
column gives the Unicode code point of the character (in hex
format), the second column gives the (Unicode) name. The
third column indicates by which class(es) the character is
matched (assuming no locale or <small>EBCDIC</small> code
page is in effect that changes the <tt>&quot;\s&quot;</tt>
matching).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Unicode
Properties</i></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><tt>&quot;\pP&quot;</tt>
and <tt>&quot;\p{Prop}&quot;</tt> are character classes to
match characters that fit given Unicode properties. One
letter property names can be used in the
<tt>&quot;\pP&quot;</tt> form, with the property name
following the <tt>&quot;\p&quot;</tt>, otherwise, braces are
required. When using braces, there is a single form, which
is just the property name enclosed in the braces, and a
compound form which looks like
<tt>&quot;\p{name=value}&quot;</tt>, which means to match if
the property &quot;name&quot; for the character has that
particular &quot;value&quot;. For instance, a match for a
number can be written as <tt>&quot;/\pN/&quot;</tt> or as
<tt>&quot;/\p{Number}/&quot;</tt>, or as
<tt>&quot;/\p{Number=True}/&quot;</tt>. Lowercase letters
are matched by the property <i>Lowercase_Letter</i> which
has the short form <i>Ll</i>. They need the braces, so are
written as <tt>&quot;/\p{Ll}/&quot;</tt> or
<tt>&quot;/\p{Lowercase_Letter}/&quot;</tt>, or
<tt>&quot;/\p{General_Category=Lowercase_Letter}/&quot;</tt>
(the underscores are optional). <tt>&quot;/\pLl/&quot;</tt>
is valid, but means something different. It matches a two
character string: a letter (Unicode property
<tt>&quot;\pL&quot;</tt>), followed by a lowercase
<tt>&quot;l&quot;</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If neither the
<tt>&quot;/a&quot;</tt> modifier nor locale rules are in
effect, the use of a Unicode property will force the regular
expression into using Unicode rules.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
almost all properties are immune to case-insensitive
matching. That is, adding a <tt>&quot;/i&quot;</tt> regular
expression modifier does not change what they match. There
are two sets that are affected. The first set is
<tt>&quot;Uppercase_Letter&quot;</tt>,
<tt>&quot;Lowercase_Letter&quot;</tt>, and
<tt>&quot;Titlecase_Letter&quot;</tt>, all of which match
<tt>&quot;Cased_Letter&quot;</tt> under
<tt>&quot;/i&quot;</tt> matching. The second set is
<tt>&quot;Uppercase&quot;</tt>,
<tt>&quot;Lowercase&quot;</tt>, and
<tt>&quot;Titlecase&quot;</tt>, all of which match
<tt>&quot;Cased&quot;</tt> under <tt>&quot;/i&quot;</tt>
matching. (The difference between these sets is that some
things, such as Roman numerals, come in both upper and lower
case, so they are <tt>&quot;Cased&quot;</tt>, but
aren&rsquo;t considered to be letters, so they aren&rsquo;t
<tt>&quot;Cased_Letter&quot;</tt>s. They&rsquo;re actually
<tt>&quot;Letter_Number&quot;</tt>s.) This set also includes
its subsets <tt>&quot;PosixUpper&quot;</tt> and
<tt>&quot;PosixLower&quot;</tt>, both of which under
<tt>&quot;/i&quot;</tt> match
<tt>&quot;PosixAlpha&quot;</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For more
details on Unicode properties, see &quot;Unicode Character
Properties&quot; in perlunicode; for a complete list of
possible properties, see &quot;Properties accessible through
\p{} and \P{}&quot; in perluniprops, which notes all forms
that have <tt>&quot;/i&quot;</tt> differences. It is also
possible to define your own properties. This is discussed in
&quot;User-Defined Character Properties&quot; in
perlunicode.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Unicode
properties are defined (surprise!) only on Unicode code
points. A warning is raised and all matches fail on
non-Unicode code points (those above the legal Unicode
maximum of 0x10FFFF). This can be somewhat surprising,</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"> chr(0x110000) =~ \p{ASCII_Hex_Digit=True}      # Fails.
 chr(0x110000) =~ \p{ASCII_Hex_Digit=False}     # Also fails!</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Even though
these two matches might be thought of as complements, they

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is worth
emphasizing that <tt>&quot;\d&quot;</tt>,
<tt>&quot;\w&quot;</tt>, etc, match single characters, not
complete numbers or words. To match a number (that consists
of digits), use <tt>&quot;\d+&quot;</tt>; to match a word,
use <tt>&quot;\w+&quot;</tt>. But be aware of the security
considerations in doing so, as mentioned above.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Bracketed
Character Classes</b> <br>
The third form of character class you can use in Perl
regular expressions is the bracketed character class. In its
simplest form, it lists the characters that may be matched,
surrounded by square brackets, like this:
<tt>&quot;[aeiou]&quot;</tt>. This matches one of
<tt>&quot;a&quot;</tt>, <tt>&quot;e&quot;</tt>,
<tt>&quot;i&quot;</tt>, <tt>&quot;o&quot;</tt> or
<tt>&quot;u&quot;</tt>. Like the other character classes,
exactly one character is matched.* To match a longer string
consisting of characters mentioned in the character class,
follow the character class with a quantifier. For instance,
<tt>&quot;[aeiou]+&quot;</tt> matches one or more lowercase
English vowels.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Repeating a
character in a character class has no effect; it&rsquo;s
considered to be in the set only once.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Examples:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"> &quot;e&quot;  =~  /[aeiou]/        # Match, as &quot;e&quot; is listed in the class.
 &quot;p&quot;  =~  /[aeiou]/        # No match, &quot;p&quot; is not listed in the class.
 &quot;ae&quot; =~  /^[aeiou]$/      # No match, a character class only matches
                           # a single character.
 &quot;ae&quot; =~  /^[aeiou]+$/     # Match, due to the quantifier.
 &minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">* There is an
exception to a bracketed character class matching a single
character only. When the class is to match caselessly under
<tt>&quot;/i&quot;</tt> matching rules, and a character
inside the class matches a multiple-character sequence
caselessly under Unicode rules, the class (when not
inverted) will also match that sequence. For example,
Unicode says that the letter <tt>&quot;LATIN SMALL LETTER
SHARP S&quot;</tt> should match the sequence
<tt>&quot;ss&quot;</tt> under <tt>&quot;/i&quot;</tt> rules.
Thus,</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"> 'ss' =~ /\A\N{LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S}\z/i             # Matches
 'ss' =~ /\A[aeioust\N{LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S}]\z/i    # Matches</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Special
Characters Inside a Bracketed Character Class</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Most characters
that are meta characters in regular expressions (that is,
characters that carry a special meaning like
<tt>&quot;.&quot;</tt>, <tt>&quot;*&quot;</tt>, or
<tt>&quot;(&quot;</tt>) lose their special meaning and can
be used inside a character class without the need to escape
them. For instance, <tt>&quot;[()]&quot;</tt> matches either
an opening parenthesis, or a closing parenthesis, and the
parens inside the character class don&rsquo;t group or
capture.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Characters that
may carry a special meaning inside a character class are:
<tt>&quot;\&quot;</tt>, <tt>&quot;^&quot;</tt>,
<tt>&quot;&minus;&quot;</tt>, <tt>&quot;[&quot;</tt> and
<tt>&quot;]&quot;</tt>, and are discussed below. They can be
escaped with a backslash, although this is sometimes not
needed, in which case the backslash may be omitted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The sequence
<tt>&quot;\b&quot;</tt> is special inside a bracketed
character class. While outside the character class,
<tt>&quot;\b&quot;</tt> is an assertion indicating a point
that does not have either two word characters or two
non-word characters on either side, inside a bracketed
character class, <tt>&quot;\b&quot;</tt> matches a backspace
character.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The sequences
<tt>&quot;\a&quot;</tt>, <tt>&quot;\c&quot;</tt>,
<tt>&quot;\e&quot;</tt>, <tt>&quot;\f&quot;</tt>,
<tt>&quot;\n&quot;</tt>,
<tt>&quot;\N{</tt><i>NAME</i><tt>}&quot;</tt>,
<tt>&quot;\N{U+</tt><i>hex char</i><tt>}&quot;</tt>,
<tt>&quot;\r&quot;</tt>, <tt>&quot;\t&quot;</tt>, and
<tt>&quot;\x&quot;</tt> are also special and have the same
meanings as they do outside a bracketed character class.
(However, inside a bracketed character class, if
<tt>&quot;\N{</tt><i>NAME</i><tt>}&quot;</tt> expands to a
sequence of characters, only the first one in the sequence
is used, with a warning.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Also, a
backslash followed by two or three octal digits is
considered an octal number.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A
<tt>&quot;[&quot;</tt> is not special inside a character
class, unless it&rsquo;s the start of a <small>POSIX</small>
character class (see &quot; <small>POSIX</small> Character
Classes&quot; below). It normally does not need
escaping.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A
<tt>&quot;]&quot;</tt> is normally either the end of a
<small>POSIX</small> character class (see &quot;
<small>POSIX</small> Character Classes&quot; below), or it
signals the end of the bracketed character class. If you
want to include a <tt>&quot;]&quot;</tt> in the set of
characters, you must generally escape it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">However, if the
<tt>&quot;]&quot;</tt> is the <i>first</i> (or the second if
the first character is a caret) character of a bracketed
character class, it does not denote the end of the class (as
you cannot have an empty class) and is considered part of
the set of characters that can be matched without
escaping.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Examples:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"> &quot;+&quot;   =~ /[+?*]/     #  Match, &quot;+&quot; in a character class is not special.
 &quot;\cH&quot; =~ /[\b]/      #  Match, \b inside in a character class
                      #  is equivalent to a backspace.
 &quot;]&quot;   =~ /[][]/      #  Match, as the character class contains.
                      #  both [ and ].
 &quot;[]&quot;  =~ /[[]]/      #  Match, the pattern contains a character class
                      #  containing just ], and the character class is
                      #  followed by a ].</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Character
Ranges</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is not
uncommon to want to match a range of characters. Luckily,
instead of listing all characters in the range, one may use
the hyphen (<tt>&quot;&minus;&quot;</tt>). If inside a
bracketed character class you have two characters separated
by a hyphen, it&rsquo;s treated as if all characters between
the two were in the class. For instance,
<tt>&quot;[0&minus;9]&quot;</tt> matches any
<small>ASCII</small> digit, and
<tt>&quot;[a&minus;m]&quot;</tt> matches any lowercase
letter from the first half of the <small>ASCII</small>
alphabet.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that the
two characters on either side of the hyphen are not
necessarily both letters or both digits. Any character is
possible, although not advisable.
<tt>&quot;['&minus;?]&quot;</tt> contains a range of
characters, but most people will not know which characters
that means. Furthermore, such ranges may lead to portability
problems if the code has to run on a platform that uses a
different character set, such as <small>EBCDIC</small> .</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If a hyphen in
a character class cannot syntactically be part of a range,
for instance because it is the first or the last character
of the character class, or if it immediately follows a
range, the hyphen isn&rsquo;t special, and so is considered
a character to be matched literally. If you want a hyphen in
your set of characters to be matched and its position in the
class is such that it could be considered part of a range,
you must escape that hyphen with a backslash.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Examples:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"> [a&minus;z]       #  Matches a character that is a lower case ASCII letter.
 [a&minus;fz]      #  Matches any letter between 'a' and 'f' (inclusive) or
             #  the letter 'z'.
 [&minus;z]        #  Matches either a hyphen ('&minus;') or the letter 'z'.
 [a&minus;f&minus;m]     #  Matches any letter between 'a' and 'f' (inclusive), the
             #  hyphen ('&minus;'), or the letter 'm'.
 ['&minus;?]       #  Matches any of the characters  '()*+,&minus;./0123456789:;&lt;=&gt;?
             #  (But not on an EBCDIC platform).</pre>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Negation</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is also
possible to instead list the characters you do not want to
match. You can do so by using a caret
(<tt>&quot;^&quot;</tt>) as the first character in the
character class. For instance,
<tt>&quot;[^a&minus;z]&quot;</tt> matches any character that
is not a lowercase <small>ASCII</small> letter, which
therefore includes more than a million Unicode code points.
The class is said to be &quot;negated&quot; or
&quot;inverted&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This syntax
make the caret a special character inside a bracketed
character class, but only if it is the first character of
the class. So if you want the caret as one of the characters
to match, either escape the caret or else don&rsquo;t list
it first.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In inverted
bracketed character classes, Perl ignores the Unicode rules
that normally say that certain characters should match a
sequence of multiple characters under caseless
<tt>&quot;/i&quot;</tt> matching. Following those rules
could lead to highly confusing situations:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"> &quot;ss&quot; =~ /^[^\xDF]+$/ui;   # Matches!</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This should
match any sequences of characters that aren&rsquo;t
<tt>&quot;\xDF&quot;</tt> nor what <tt>&quot;\xDF&quot;</tt>
matches under <tt>&quot;/i&quot;</tt>.
<tt>&quot;s&quot;</tt> isn&rsquo;t
<tt>&quot;\xDF&quot;</tt>, but Unicode says that
<tt>&quot;ss&quot;</tt> is what <tt>&quot;\xDF&quot;</tt>
matches under <tt>&quot;/i&quot;</tt>. So which one
&quot;wins&quot;? Do you fail the match because the string
has <tt>&quot;ss&quot;</tt> or accept it because it has an
<tt>&quot;s&quot;</tt> followed by another
<tt>&quot;s&quot;</tt>? Perl has chosen the latter.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Examples:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"> &quot;e&quot;  =~  /[^aeiou]/   #  No match, the 'e' is listed.
 &quot;x&quot;  =~  /[^aeiou]/   #  Match, as 'x' isn't a lowercase vowel.
 &quot;^&quot;  =~  /[^^]/       #  No match, matches anything that isn't a caret.
 &quot;^&quot;  =~  /[x^]/       #  Match, caret is not special here.</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Backslash
Sequences</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can put any
backslash sequence character class (with the exception of
<tt>&quot;\N&quot;</tt> and <tt>&quot;\R&quot;</tt>) inside
a bracketed character class, and it will act just as if you
had put all characters matched by the backslash sequence
inside the character class. For instance,
<tt>&quot;[a&minus;f\d]&quot;</tt> matches any decimal
digit, or any of the lowercase letters between
&rsquo;a&rsquo; and &rsquo;f&rsquo; inclusive.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><tt>&quot;\N&quot;</tt>
within a bracketed character class must be of the forms
<tt>&quot;\N{</tt><i>name</i><tt>}&quot;</tt> or
<tt>&quot;\N{U+</tt><i>hex char</i><tt>}&quot;</tt>, and
<small>NOT</small> be the form that matches non-newlines,
for the same reason that a dot <tt>&quot;.&quot;</tt> inside
a bracketed character class loses its special meaning: it
matches nearly anything, which generally isn&rsquo;t what
you want to happen.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Examples:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"> /[\p{Thai}\d]/     # Matches a character that is either a Thai
                    # character, or a digit.
 /[^\p{Arabic}()]/  # Matches a character that is neither an Arabic
                    # character, nor a parenthesis.</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Backslash
sequence character classes cannot form one of the endpoints
of a range. Thus, you can&rsquo;t say:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"> /[\p{Thai}&minus;\d]/     # Wrong!</pre>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i><small>POSIX</small>
Character Classes</i></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><small>POSIX</small>
character classes have the form
<tt>&quot;[:class:]&quot;</tt>, where <i>class</i> is name,
and the <tt>&quot;[:&quot;</tt> and <tt>&quot;:]&quot;</tt>
delimiters. <small>POSIX</small> character classes only
appear <i>inside</i> bracketed character classes, and are a
convenient and descriptive way of listing a group of
characters.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Be careful
about the syntax,</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"> # Correct:
 $string =~ /[[:alpha:]]/
 # Incorrect (will warn):
 $string =~ /[:alpha:]/</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The latter
pattern would be a character class consisting of a colon,
and the letters <tt>&quot;a&quot;</tt>,
<tt>&quot;l&quot;</tt>, <tt>&quot;p&quot;</tt> and

match what <tt>&quot;\p{PosixPunct}&quot;</tt> matches in
the <small>ASCII</small> range, plus what
<tt>&quot;\p{Punct}&quot;</tt> matches. This is different
than strictly matching according to
<tt>&quot;\p{Punct}&quot;</tt>. Another way to say it is
that if Unicode rules are in effect,
<tt>&quot;[[:punct:]]&quot;</tt> matches all characters that
Unicode considers punctuation, plus all ASCII-range
characters that Unicode considers symbols.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There are
various other synonyms that can be used besides the names
listed in the table. For example,
<tt>&quot;\p{PosixAlpha}&quot;</tt> can be written as
<tt>&quot;\p{Alpha}&quot;</tt>. All are listed in
&quot;Properties accessible through \p{} and \P{}&quot; in
perluniprops, plus all characters matched by each
ASCII-range property.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Both the
<tt>&quot;\p&quot;</tt> counterparts always assume Unicode
rules are in effect. On <small>ASCII</small> platforms, this
means they assume that the code points from 128 to 255 are
Latin&minus;1, and that means that using them under locale
rules is unwise unless the locale is guaranteed to be
Latin&minus;1 or <small>UTF&minus;8</small> . In contrast,
the <small>POSIX</small> character classes are useful under
locale rules. They are affected by the actual rules in
effect, as follows: <br>
If the &quot;/a&quot; modifier, is in effect ...</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Each of the
<small>POSIX</small> classes matches exactly the same as
their ASCII-range counterparts.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">otherwise ...</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">For code points above 255
...</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">The <small>POSIX</small> class
matches the same as its Full-range counterpart.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">For code points below 256
...</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">if locale rules are in effect
...</p>

<p style="margin-left:29%;">The <small>POSIX</small> class
matches according to the locale, except that
<tt>&quot;word&quot;</tt> uses the platform&rsquo;s native
underscore character, no matter what the locale is.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">if Unicode rules are in effect
or if on an <small>EBCDIC</small> platform ...</p>

<p style="margin-left:29%;">The <small>POSIX</small> class
matches the same as the Full-range counterpart.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">otherwise ...</p>

<p style="margin-left:29%;">The <small>POSIX</small> class
matches the same as the <small>ASCII</small> range
counterpart.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Which rules
apply are determined as described in &quot;Which character
set modifier is in effect?&quot; in perlre.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is proposed
to change this behavior in a future release of Perl so that
whether or not Unicode rules are in effect would not change
the behavior: Outside of locale or an <small>EBCDIC</small>
code page, the <small>POSIX</small> classes would behave
like their ASCII-range counterparts. If you wish to comment
on this proposal, send email to
<tt>&quot;perl5&minus;porters@perl.org&quot;</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Negation of
<small>POSIX</small> character classes</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A Perl
extension to the <small>POSIX</small> character class is the
ability to negate it. This is done by prefixing the class
name with a caret (<tt>&quot;^&quot;</tt>). Some
examples:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">     POSIX         ASCII&minus;range     Full&minus;range  backslash
                    Unicode         Unicode    sequence
 &minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;
 [[:^digit:]]   \P{PosixDigit}  \P{XPosixDigit}   \D
 [[:^space:]]   \P{PosixSpace}  \P{XPosixSpace}
                \P{PerlSpace}   \P{XPerlSpace}    \S
 [[:^word:]]    \P{PerlWord}    \P{XPosixWord}    \W</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The backslash
sequence can mean either <small>ASCII&minus;</small> or
Full-range Unicode, depending on various factors as
described in &quot;Which character set modifier is in
effect?&quot; in perlre.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">[= =] and [.
.]</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Perl recognizes
the <small>POSIX</small> character classes
<tt>&quot;[=class=]&quot;</tt> and
<tt>&quot;[.class.]&quot;</tt>, but does not (yet?) support
them. Any attempt to use either construct raises an
exception.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Examples</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"> /[[:digit:]]/            # Matches a character that is a digit.
 /[01[:lower:]]/          # Matches a character that is either a
                          # lowercase letter, or '0' or '1'.
 /[[:digit:][:^xdigit:]]/ # Matches a character that can be anything
                          # except the letters 'a' to 'f'.  This is
                          # because the main character class is composed
                          # of two POSIX character classes that are ORed
                          # together, one that matches any digit, and
                          # the other that matches anything that isn't a
                          # hex digit.  The result matches all
                          # characters except the letters 'a' to 'f' and
                          # 'A' to 'F'.</pre>
