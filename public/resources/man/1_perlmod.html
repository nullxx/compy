Perl modules (packages and symbol tables)</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Packages</b>
<br>
Perl provides a mechanism for alternative namespaces to
protect packages from stomping on each other&rsquo;s
variables. In fact, there&rsquo;s really no such thing as a
global variable in Perl. The package statement declares the
compilation unit as being in the given namespace. The scope
of the package declaration is from the declaration itself
through the end of the enclosing block,
<tt>&quot;eval&quot;</tt>, or file, whichever comes first
(the same scope as the <i>my()</i> and <i>local()</i>
operators). Unqualified dynamic identifiers will be in this
namespace, except for those few identifiers that if
unqualified, default to the main package instead of the
current one as described below. A package statement affects
only dynamic variables--including those you&rsquo;ve used
<i>local()</i> on--but <i>not</i> lexical variables created
with <i>my()</i>. Typically it would be the first
declaration in a file included by the
<tt>&quot;do&quot;</tt>, <tt>&quot;require&quot;</tt>, or
<tt>&quot;use&quot;</tt> operators. You can switch into a
package in more than one place; it merely influences which
symbol table is used by the compiler for the rest of that
block. You can refer to variables and filehandles in other
packages by prefixing the identifier with the package name
and a double colon: <tt>$Package::Variable</tt>. If the
package name is null, the <tt>&quot;main&quot;</tt> package
is assumed. That is, <tt>$::sail</tt> is equivalent to
<tt>$main::sail</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The old package
delimiter was a single quote, but double colon is now the
preferred delimiter, in part because it&rsquo;s more
readable to humans, and in part because it&rsquo;s more
readable to <b>emacs</b> macros. It also makes C
<small>++</small> programmers feel like they know
what&rsquo;s going on--as opposed to using the single quote
as separator, which was there to make Ada programmers feel
like they knew what was going on. Because the old-fashioned
syntax is still supported for backwards compatibility, if
you try to use a string like <tt>&quot;This is $owner's
house&quot;</tt>, you&rsquo;ll be accessing
<tt>$owner::s</tt>; that is, the <tt>$s</tt> variable in
package <tt>&quot;owner&quot;</tt>, which is probably not
what you meant. Use braces to disambiguate, as in
<tt>&quot;This is ${owner}'s house&quot;</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Packages may
themselves contain package separators, as in
<tt>$OUTER::INNER::var</tt>. This implies nothing about the
order of name lookups, however. There are no relative
packages: all symbols are either local to the current
package, or must be fully qualified from the outer package
name down. For instance, there is nowhere within package
<tt>&quot;OUTER&quot;</tt> that <tt>$INNER::var</tt> refers
to <tt>$OUTER::INNER::var</tt>. <tt>&quot;INNER&quot;</tt>
refers to a totally separate global package.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Only
identifiers starting with letters (or underscore) are stored
in a package&rsquo;s symbol table. All other symbols are
kept in package <tt>&quot;main&quot;</tt>, including all
punctuation variables, like <tt>$_</tt>. In addition, when
unqualified, the identifiers <small>STDIN</small> ,
<small>STDOUT</small> , <small>STDERR</small> ,
<small>ARGV</small> , <small>ARGVOUT</small> ,
<small>ENV</small> , <small>INC</small> , and
<small>SIG</small> are forced to be in package
<tt>&quot;main&quot;</tt>, even when used for other purposes
than their built-in ones. If you have a package called
<tt>&quot;m&quot;</tt>, <tt>&quot;s&quot;</tt>, or
<tt>&quot;y&quot;</tt>, then you can&rsquo;t use the
qualified form of an identifier because it would be instead
interpreted as a pattern match, a substitution, or a
transliteration.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Variables
beginning with underscore used to be forced into package
main, but we decided it was more useful for package writers
to be able to use leading underscore to indicate private
variables and method names. However, variables and functions
named with a single <tt>&quot;_&quot;</tt>, such as
<tt>$_</tt> and <tt>&quot;sub _&quot;</tt>, are still forced
into the package <tt>&quot;main&quot;</tt>. See also
&quot;The Syntax of Variable Names&quot; in perlvar.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><tt>&quot;eval&quot;</tt>ed
strings are compiled in the package in which the
<i>eval()</i> was compiled. (Assignments to <tt>$SIG{}</tt>,
however, assume the signal handler specified is in the
<tt>&quot;main&quot;</tt> package. Qualify the signal
handler name if you wish to have a signal handler in a
package.) For an example, examine <i>perldb.pl</i> in the
Perl library. It initially switches to the
<tt>&quot;DB&quot;</tt> package so that the debugger
doesn&rsquo;t interfere with variables in the program you
are trying to debug. At various points, however, it
temporarily switches back to the <tt>&quot;main&quot;</tt>
package to evaluate various expressions in the context of
the <tt>&quot;main&quot;</tt> package (or wherever you came
from). See perldebug.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The special
symbol <tt>&quot;__PACKAGE__&quot;</tt> contains the current
package, but cannot (easily) be used to construct variable
names.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">See perlsub for
other scoping issues related to <i>my()</i> and
<i>local()</i>, and perlref regarding closures.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Symbol
Tables</b> <br>
The symbol table for a package happens to be stored in the
hash of that name with two colons appended. The main symbol
table&rsquo;s name is thus <tt>%main::</tt>, or <tt>%::</tt>
for short. Likewise the symbol table for the nested package
mentioned earlier is named <tt>%OUTER::INNER::</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The value in
each entry of the hash is what you are referring to when you
use the <tt>*name</tt> typeglob notation.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    local *main::foo    = *main::bar;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can use
this to print out all the variables in a package, for
instance. The standard but antiquated <i>dumpvar.pl</i>
library and the <small>CPAN</small> module Devel::Symdump
make use of this.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The results of
creating new symbol table entries directly or modifying any
entries that are not already typeglobs are undefined and
subject to change between releases of perl.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Assignment to a
typeglob performs an aliasing operation, i.e.,</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    *dick = *richard;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">causes
variables, subroutines, formats, and file and directory
handles accessible via the identifier
<tt>&quot;richard&quot;</tt> also to be accessible via the
identifier <tt>&quot;dick&quot;</tt>. If you want to alias
only a particular variable or subroutine, assign a reference
instead:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    *dick = \$richard;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Which makes
<tt>$richard</tt> and <tt>$dick</tt> the same variable, but
leaves <tt>@richard</tt> and <tt>@dick</tt> as separate
arrays. Tricky, eh?</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There is one
subtle difference between the following statements:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    *foo = *bar;
    *foo = \$bar;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;*foo =
*bar&quot; makes the typeglobs themselves synonymous while
<tt>&quot;*foo = \$bar&quot;</tt> makes the
<small>SCALAR</small> portions of two distinct typeglobs
refer to the same scalar value. This means that the
following code:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    $bar = 1;
    *foo = \$bar;       # Make $foo an alias for $bar
    {
        local $bar = 2; # Restrict changes to block
        print $foo;     # Prints '1'!
    }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Would print
&rsquo;1&rsquo;, because <tt>$foo</tt> holds a reference to
the <i>original</i> <tt>$bar</tt>. The one that was stuffed
away by <tt>&quot;local()&quot;</tt> and which will be
restored when the block ends. Because variables are accessed
through the typeglob, you can use <tt>&quot;*foo =
*bar&quot;</tt> to create an alias which can be localized.
(But be aware that this means you can&rsquo;t have a
separate <tt>@foo</tt> and <tt>@bar</tt>, etc.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">What makes all
of this important is that the Exporter module uses glob
aliasing as the import/export mechanism. Whether or not you
can properly localize a variable that has been exported from
a module depends on how it was exported:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    @EXPORT = qw($FOO); # Usual form, can't be localized
    @EXPORT = qw(*FOO); # Can be localized</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can work
around the first case by using the fully qualified name
(<tt>$Package::FOO</tt>) where you need a local value, or by
overriding it by saying <tt>&quot;*FOO =
*Package::FOO&quot;</tt> in your script.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<tt>&quot;*x = \$y&quot;</tt> mechanism may be used to pass
and return cheap references into or from subroutines if you
don&rsquo;t want to copy the whole thing. It only works when
assigning to dynamic variables, not lexicals.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    %some_hash = ();                    # can't be my()
    *some_hash = fn( \%another_hash );
    sub fn {
        local *hashsym = shift;
        # now use %hashsym normally, and you
        # will affect the caller's %another_hash
        my %nhash = (); # do what you want
        return \%nhash;
    }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On return, the
reference will overwrite the hash slot in the symbol table
specified by the *some_hash typeglob. This is a somewhat
tricky way of passing around references cheaply when you
don&rsquo;t want to have to remember to dereference
variables explicitly.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Another use of
symbol tables is for making &quot;constant&quot;
scalars.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    *PI = \3.14159265358979;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Now you cannot
alter <tt>$PI</tt>, which is probably a good thing all in
all. This isn&rsquo;t the same as a constant subroutine,
which is subject to optimization at compile-time. A constant
subroutine is one prototyped to take no arguments and to
return a constant expression. See perlsub for details on
these. The <tt>&quot;use constant&quot;</tt> pragma is a
convenient shorthand for these.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can say
<tt>*foo{PACKAGE}</tt> and <tt>*foo{NAME}</tt> to find out
what name and package the *foo symbol table entry comes
from. This may be useful in a subroutine that gets passed
typeglobs as arguments:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    sub identify_typeglob {
        my $glob = shift;
        print 'You gave me ', *{$glob}{PACKAGE}, '::', *{$glob}{NAME}, &quot;\n&quot;;
    }
    identify_typeglob *foo;
    identify_typeglob *bar::baz;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This prints</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    You gave me main::foo
    You gave me bar::baz</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<tt>*foo{THING}</tt> notation can also be used to obtain
references to the individual elements of *foo. See
perlref.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Subroutine
definitions (and declarations, for that matter) need not
necessarily be situated in the package whose symbol table
they occupy. You can define a subroutine outside its package
by explicitly qualifying the name of the subroutine:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    package main;
    sub Some_package::foo { ... }   # &amp;foo defined in Some_package</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This is just a
shorthand for a typeglob assignment at compile time:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    BEGIN { *Some_package::foo = sub { ... } }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">and is
<i>not</i> the same as writing:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    {
        package Some_package;
        sub foo { ... }
    }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In the first
two versions, the body of the subroutine is lexically in the
main package, <i>not</i> in Some_package. So something like
this:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    package main;
    $Some_package::name = &quot;fred&quot;;
    $main::name = &quot;barney&quot;;
    sub Some_package::foo {
        print &quot;in &quot;, __PACKAGE__, &quot;: \$name is '$name'\n&quot;;
    }
    Some_package::foo();</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">prints:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    in main: $name is 'barney'</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">rather
than:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    in Some_package: $name is 'fred'</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This also has
implications for the use of the <small>SUPER::</small>
qualifier (see perlobj).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b><small>BEGIN</small>
, <small>UNITCHECK</small> , <small>CHECK</small> ,
<small>INIT</small> and <small>END</small></b> <br>
Five specially named code blocks are executed at the
beginning and at the end of a running Perl program. These
are the <tt>&quot;BEGIN&quot;</tt>,
<tt>&quot;UNITCHECK&quot;</tt>, <tt>&quot;CHECK&quot;</tt>,
<tt>&quot;INIT&quot;</tt>, and <tt>&quot;END&quot;</tt>
blocks.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These code
blocks can be prefixed with <tt>&quot;sub&quot;</tt> to give
the appearance of a subroutine (although this is not
considered good style). One should note that these code
blocks don&rsquo;t really exist as named subroutines
(despite their appearance). The thing that gives this away
is the fact that you can have <b>more than one</b> of these
code blocks in a program, and they will get <b>all</b>
executed at the appropriate moment. So you can&rsquo;t
execute any of these code blocks by name.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A
<tt>&quot;BEGIN&quot;</tt> code block is executed as soon as
possible, that is, the moment it is completely defined, even
before the rest of the containing file (or string) is
parsed. You may have multiple <tt>&quot;BEGIN&quot;</tt>
blocks within a file (or eval&rsquo;ed string); they will
execute in order of definition. Because a
<tt>&quot;BEGIN&quot;</tt> code block executes immediately,
it can pull in definitions of subroutines and such from
other files in time to be visible to the rest of the compile
and run time. Once a <tt>&quot;BEGIN&quot;</tt> has run, it
is immediately undefined and any code it used is returned to
Perl&rsquo;s memory pool.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">An
<tt>&quot;END&quot;</tt> code block is executed as late as
possible, that is, after perl has finished running the
program and just before the interpreter is being exited,
even if it is exiting as a result of a <i>die()</i>
function. (But not if it&rsquo;s morphing into another
program via <tt>&quot;exec&quot;</tt>, or being blown out of
the water by a signal--you have to trap that yourself (if
you can).) You may have multiple <tt>&quot;END&quot;</tt>
blocks within a file--they will execute in reverse order of
definition; that is: last in, first out (
<small>LIFO</small> ). <tt>&quot;END&quot;</tt> blocks are
not executed when you run perl with the
<tt>&quot;&minus;c&quot;</tt> switch, or if compilation
fails.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
<tt>&quot;END&quot;</tt> code blocks are <b>not</b> executed
at the end of a string <tt>&quot;eval()&quot;</tt>: if any
<tt>&quot;END&quot;</tt> code blocks are created in a string
<tt>&quot;eval()&quot;</tt>, they will be executed just as
any other <tt>&quot;END&quot;</tt> code block of that
package in <small>LIFO</small> order just before the
interpreter is being exited.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Inside an
<tt>&quot;END&quot;</tt> code block, <tt>$?</tt> contains
the value that the program is going to pass to
<tt>&quot;exit()&quot;</tt>. You can modify <tt>$?</tt> to
change the exit value of the program. Beware of changing
<tt>$?</tt> by accident (e.g. by running something via
<tt>&quot;system&quot;</tt>).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Inside of a
<tt>&quot;END&quot;</tt> block, the value of
<tt>&quot;${^GLOBAL_PHASE}&quot;</tt> will be
<tt>&quot;END&quot;</tt>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><tt>&quot;UNITCHECK&quot;</tt>,
<tt>&quot;CHECK&quot;</tt> and <tt>&quot;INIT&quot;</tt>
code blocks are useful to catch the transition between the
compilation phase and the execution phase of the main
program.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><tt>&quot;UNITCHECK&quot;</tt>
blocks are run just after the unit which defined them has
been compiled. The main program file and each module it
loads are compilation units, as are string
<tt>&quot;eval&quot;</tt>s, code compiled using the
<tt>&quot;(?{ })&quot;</tt> construct in a regex, calls to
<tt>&quot;do FILE&quot;</tt>, <tt>&quot;require
FILE&quot;</tt>, and code after the
<tt>&quot;&minus;e&quot;</tt> switch on the command
line.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><tt>&quot;BEGIN&quot;</tt>
and <tt>&quot;UNITCHECK&quot;</tt> blocks are not directly
related to the phase of the interpreter. They can be created
and executed during any phase.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><tt>&quot;CHECK&quot;</tt>
code blocks are run just after the <b>initial</b> Perl
compile phase ends and before the run time begins, in
<small>LIFO</small> order. <tt>&quot;CHECK&quot;</tt> code
blocks are used in the Perl compiler suite to save the
compiled state of the program.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Inside of a
<tt>&quot;CHECK&quot;</tt> block, the value of
<tt>&quot;${^GLOBAL_PHASE}&quot;</tt> will be
<tt>&quot;CHECK&quot;</tt>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><tt>&quot;INIT&quot;</tt>
blocks are run just before the Perl runtime begins
execution, in &quot;first in, first out&quot; (
<small>FIFO</small> ) order.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Inside of an
<tt>&quot;INIT&quot;</tt> block, the value of
<tt>&quot;${^GLOBAL_PHASE}&quot;</tt> will be
<tt>&quot;INIT&quot;</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<tt>&quot;CHECK&quot;</tt> and <tt>&quot;INIT&quot;</tt>
blocks in code compiled by <tt>&quot;require&quot;</tt>,
string <tt>&quot;do&quot;</tt>, or string
<tt>&quot;eval&quot;</tt> will not be executed if they occur
after the end of the main compilation phase; that can be a
problem in mod_perl and other persistent environments which
use those functions to load code at runtime.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When you use
the <b>&minus;n</b> and <b>&minus;p</b> switches to Perl,
<tt>&quot;BEGIN&quot;</tt> and <tt>&quot;END&quot;</tt> work
just as they do in <b>awk</b>, as a degenerate case. Both
<tt>&quot;BEGIN&quot;</tt> and <tt>&quot;CHECK&quot;</tt>
blocks are run when you use the <b>&minus;c</b> switch for a
compile-only syntax check, although your main code is
not.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>begincheck</b> program makes it all clear,
eventually:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">  #!/usr/bin/perl
  # begincheck
  print         &quot;10. Ordinary code runs at runtime.\n&quot;;
  END { print   &quot;16.   So this is the end of the tale.\n&quot; }
  INIT { print  &quot; 7. INIT blocks run FIFO just before runtime.\n&quot; }
  UNITCHECK {
    print       &quot; 4.   And therefore before any CHECK blocks.\n&quot;
  }
  CHECK { print &quot; 6.   So this is the sixth line.\n&quot; }
  print         &quot;11.   It runs in order, of course.\n&quot;;
  BEGIN { print &quot; 1. BEGIN blocks run FIFO during compilation.\n&quot; }
  END { print   &quot;15.   Read perlmod for the rest of the story.\n&quot; }
  CHECK { print &quot; 5. CHECK blocks run LIFO after all compilation.\n&quot; }
  INIT { print  &quot; 8.   Run this again, using Perl's &minus;c switch.\n&quot; }
  print         &quot;12.   This is anti&minus;obfuscated code.\n&quot;;
  END { print   &quot;14. END blocks run LIFO at quitting time.\n&quot; }
  BEGIN { print &quot; 2.   So this line comes out second.\n&quot; }
  UNITCHECK {
   print &quot; 3. UNITCHECK blocks run LIFO after each file is compiled.\n&quot;
  }
  INIT { print  &quot; 9.   You'll see the difference right away.\n&quot; }
  print         &quot;13.   It merely _looks_ like it should be confusing.\n&quot;;
  __END__</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Perl
Classes</b> <br>
There is no special class syntax in Perl, but a package may
act as a class if it provides subroutines to act as methods.
Such a package may also derive some of its methods from
another class (package) by listing the other package name(s)
in its global <tt>@ISA</tt> array (which must be a package
global, not a lexical).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For more on
this, see perlootut and perlobj.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Perl
Modules</b> <br>
A module is just a set of related functions in a library
file, i.e., a Perl package with the same name as the file.
It is specifically designed to be reusable by other modules
or programs. It may do this by providing a mechanism for
exporting some of its symbols into the symbol table of any
package using it, or it may function as a class definition
and make its semantics available implicitly through method
calls on the class and its objects, without explicitly
exporting anything. Or it can do a little of both.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For example, to
start a traditional, non-OO module called Some::Module,
create a file called <i>Some/Module.pm</i> and start with
this template:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    package Some::Module;  # assumes Some/Module.pm
    use strict;
    use warnings;
    BEGIN {
        require Exporter;
        # set the version for version checking
        our $VERSION     = 1.00;

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Then go on to
declare and use your variables in functions without any
qualifications. See Exporter and the perlmodlib for details
on mechanics and style issues in module creation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Perl modules
are included into your program by saying</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    use Module;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">or</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    use Module LIST;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This is exactly
equivalent to</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    BEGIN { require 'Module.pm'; 'Module'&minus;&gt;import; }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">or</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    BEGIN { require 'Module.pm'; 'Module'&minus;&gt;import( LIST ); }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As a special
case</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    use Module ();</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">is exactly
equivalent to</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    BEGIN { require 'Module.pm'; }</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">All Perl module
files have the extension <i>.pm</i>. The
<tt>&quot;use&quot;</tt> operator assumes this so you
don&rsquo;t have to spell out &quot;<i>Module.pm</i>&quot;
in quotes. This also helps to differentiate new modules from
old <i>.pl</i> and <i>.ph</i> files. Module names are also
capitalized unless they&rsquo;re functioning as pragmas;
pragmas are in effect compiler directives, and are sometimes
called &quot;pragmatic modules&quot; (or even
&quot;pragmata&quot; if you&rsquo;re a classicist).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The two
statements:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    require SomeModule;
    require &quot;SomeModule.pm&quot;;</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">differ from
each other in two ways. In the first case, any double colons
in the module name, such as
<tt>&quot;Some::Module&quot;</tt>, are translated into your
system&rsquo;s directory separator, usually &quot;/&quot;.
The second case does not, and would have to be specified
literally. The other difference is that seeing the first
<tt>&quot;require&quot;</tt> clues in the compiler that uses
of indirect object notation involving
&quot;SomeModule&quot;, as in <tt>&quot;$ob = purge
SomeModule&quot;</tt>, are method calls, not function calls.
(Yes, this really can make a difference.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Because the
<tt>&quot;use&quot;</tt> statement implies a
<tt>&quot;BEGIN&quot;</tt> block, the importing of semantics
happens as soon as the <tt>&quot;use&quot;</tt> statement is
compiled, before the rest of the file is compiled. This is
how it is able to function as a pragma mechanism, and also
how modules are able to declare subroutines that are then
visible as list or unary operators for the rest of the
current file. This will not work if you use
<tt>&quot;require&quot;</tt> instead of
<tt>&quot;use&quot;</tt>. With <tt>&quot;require&quot;</tt>
you can get into this problem:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">    require Cwd;                # make Cwd:: accessible
    $here = Cwd::getcwd();
    use Cwd;                    # import names from Cwd::
    $here = getcwd();
    require Cwd;                # make Cwd:: accessible
    $here = getcwd();           # oops! no main::getcwd()</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In general,
<tt>&quot;use Module ()&quot;</tt> is recommended over
<tt>&quot;require Module&quot;</tt>, because it determines
module availability at compile time, not in the middle of
your program&rsquo;s execution. An exception would be if two
modules each tried to <tt>&quot;use&quot;</tt> each other,
and each also called a function from that other module. In
that case, it&rsquo;s easy to use
<tt>&quot;require&quot;</tt> instead.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Perl packages
may be nested inside other package names, so we can have
package names containing <tt>&quot;::&quot;</tt>. But if we
used that package name directly as a filename it would make
for unwieldy or impossible filenames on some systems.
Therefore, if a module&rsquo;s name is, say,
<tt>&quot;Text::Soundex&quot;</tt>, then its definition is
actually found in the library file
<i>Text/Soundex.pm</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Perl modules
always have a <i>.pm</i> file, but there may also be
dynamically linked executables (often ending in <i>.so</i>)
or autoloaded subroutine definitions (often ending in
<i>.al</i>) associated with the module. If so, these will be
entirely transparent to the user of the module. It is the
responsibility of the <i>.pm</i> file to load (or arrange to
autoload) any additional functionality. For example,
although the <small>POSIX</small> module happens to do both
dynamic loading and autoloading, the user can say just
<tt>&quot;use POSIX&quot;</tt> to get it all.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Making your
module threadsafe</b> <br>
Since 5.6.0, Perl has had support for a new type of threads
called interpreter threads (ithreads). These threads can be
used explicitly and implicitly.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Ithreads work
by cloning the data tree so that no data is shared between
different threads. These threads can be used by using the
<tt>&quot;threads&quot;</tt> module or by doing
<i>fork()</i> on win32 (fake <i>fork()</i> support). When a
thread is cloned all Perl data is cloned, however non-Perl
data cannot be cloned automatically. Perl after 5.7.2 has
support for the <tt>&quot;CLONE&quot;</tt> special
subroutine. In <tt>&quot;CLONE&quot;</tt> you can do
whatever you need to do, like for example handle the cloning
of non-Perl data, if necessary. <tt>&quot;CLONE&quot;</tt>
will be called once as a class method for every package that
has it defined (or inherits it). It will be called in the
context of the new thread, so all modifications are made in
the new area. Currently <small>CLONE</small> is called with
no parameters other than the invocant package name, but code
should not assume that this will remain unchanged, as it is
likely that in future extra parameters will be passed in to
give more information about the state of cloning.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you want to
<small>CLONE</small> all objects you will need to keep track
of them per package. This is simply done using a hash and
<i>Scalar::Util::weaken()</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Perl after
5.8.7 has support for the <tt>&quot;CLONE_SKIP&quot;</tt>
special subroutine. Like <tt>&quot;CLONE&quot;</tt>,
<tt>&quot;CLONE_SKIP&quot;</tt> is called once per package;
however, it is called just before cloning starts, and in the
context of the parent thread. If it returns a true value,
then no objects of that class will be cloned; or rather,
they will be copied as unblessed, undef values. For example:
if in the parent there are two references to a single
blessed hash, then in the child there will be two references
to a single undefined scalar value instead. This provides a
simple mechanism for making a module threadsafe; just add
<tt>&quot;sub CLONE_SKIP { 1 }&quot;</tt> at the top of the
class, and <tt>&quot;DESTROY()&quot;</tt> will now only be
called once per object. Of course, if the child thread needs
to make use of the objects, then a more sophisticated
approach is needed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Like
<tt>&quot;CLONE&quot;</tt>, <tt>&quot;CLONE_SKIP&quot;</tt>
is currently called with no parameters other than the
invocant package name, although that may change. Similarly,
to allow for future expansion, the return value should be a
single <tt>0</tt> or <tt>1</tt> value.</p>
