<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Normally, the
tty driver buffers typed characters until a newline or
carriage return is typed. The <b>cbreak</b> routine disables
line buffering and erase/kill character-processing
(interrupt and flow control characters are unaffected),
making characters typed by the user immediately available to
the program. The <b>nocbreak</b> routine returns the
terminal to normal (cooked) mode.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Initially the
terminal may or may not be in <b>cbreak</b> mode, as the
mode is inherited; therefore, a program should call
<b>cbreak</b> or <b>nocbreak</b> explicitly. Most
interactive programs using <b>curses</b> set the
<b>cbreak</b> mode. Note that <b>cbreak</b> overrides
<b>raw</b>. [See <b>curs_getch</b>(3X) for a discussion of
how these routines interact with <b>echo</b> and
<b>noecho</b>.]</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The <b>echo</b>
and <b>noecho</b> routines control whether characters typed
by the user are echoed by <b>getch</b> as they are typed.
Echoing by the tty driver is always disabled, but initially
<b>getch</b> is in echo mode, so characters typed are
echoed. Authors of most interactive programs prefer to do
their own echoing in a controlled area of the screen, or not
to echo at all, so they disable echoing by calling
<b>noecho</b>. [See <b>curs_getch</b>(3X) for a discussion
of how these routines interact with <b>cbreak</b> and
<b>nocbreak</b>.]</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>halfdelay</b> routine is used for half-delay mode, which
is similar to <b>cbreak</b> mode in that characters typed by
the user are immediately available to the program. However,
after blocking for <i>tenths</i> tenths of seconds, ERR is
returned if nothing has been typed. The value of
<b>tenths</b> must be a number between 1 and 255. Use
<b>nocbreak</b> to leave half-delay mode.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the
<b>intrflush</b> option is enabled, (<i>bf</i> is
<b>TRUE</b>), when an interrupt key is pressed on the
keyboard (interrupt, break, quit) all output in the tty
driver queue will be flushed, giving the effect of faster
response to the interrupt, but causing <b>curses</b> to have
the wrong idea of what is on the screen. Disabling
(<i>bf</i> is <b>FALSE</b>), the option prevents the flush.
The default for the option is inherited from the tty driver
settings. The window argument is ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>keypad</b> option enables the keypad of the user&rsquo;s
terminal. If enabled (<i>bf</i> is <b>TRUE</b>), the user
can press a function key (such as an arrow key) and
<b>wgetch</b> returns a single value representing the
function key, as in <b>KEY_LEFT</b>. If disabled (<i>bf</i>
is <b>FALSE</b>), <b>curses</b> does not treat function keys
specially and the program has to interpret the escape
sequences itself. If the keypad in the terminal can be
turned on (made to transmit) and off (made to work locally),
turning on this option causes the terminal keypad to be
turned on when <b>wgetch</b> is called. The default value
for keypad is false.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Initially,
whether the terminal returns 7 or 8 significant bits on
input depends on the control mode of the tty driver [see
termio(7)]. To force 8 bits to be returned, invoke
<b>meta</b>(<i>win</i>, <b>TRUE</b>); this is equivalent,
under POSIX, to setting the CS8 flag on the terminal. To
force 7 bits to be returned, invoke <b>meta</b>(<i>win</i>,
<b>FALSE</b>); this is equivalent, under POSIX, to setting
the CS7 flag on the terminal. The window argument,
<i>win</i>, is always ignored. If the terminfo capabilities
<b>smm</b> (meta_on) and <b>rmm</b> (meta_off) are defined
for the terminal, <b>smm</b> is sent to the terminal when
<b>meta</b>(<i>win</i>, <b>TRUE</b>) is called and
<b>rmm</b> is sent when <b>meta</b>(<i>win</i>,
<b>FALSE</b>) is called.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>nodelay</b> option causes <b>getch</b> to be a
non-blocking call. If no input is ready, <b>getch</b>
returns <b>ERR</b>. If disabled (<i>bf</i> is <b>FALSE</b>),
<b>getch</b> waits until a key is pressed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">While
interpreting an input escape sequence, <b>wgetch</b> sets a
timer while waiting for the next character. If
<b>notimeout(</b><i>win</i>, <b>TRUE</b>) is called, then
<b>wgetch</b> does not set a timer. The purpose of the
timeout is to differentiate between sequences received from
a function key and those typed by a user.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The <b>raw</b>
and <b>noraw</b> routines place the terminal into or out of
raw mode. Raw mode is similar to <b>cbreak</b> mode, in that
characters typed are immediately passed through to the user
program. The differences are that in raw mode, the
interrupt, quit, suspend, and flow control characters are
all passed through uninterpreted, instead of generating a
signal. The behavior of the BREAK key depends on other bits
in the tty driver that are not set by <b>curses</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When the
<b>noqiflush</b> routine is used, normal flush of input and
output queues associated with the <b>INTR</b>, <b>QUIT</b>
and <b>SUSP</b> characters will not be done [see termio(7)].
When <b>qiflush</b> is called, the queues will be flushed
when these control characters are read. You may want to call
<b>noqiflush()</b> in a signal handler if you want output to
continue as though the interrupt had not occurred, after the
handler exits.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>timeout</b> and <b>wtimeout</b> routines set blocking or
non-blocking read for a given window. If <i>delay</i> is
negative, blocking read is used (i.e., waits indefinitely
for input). If <i>delay</i> is zero, then non-blocking read
is used (i.e., read returns <b>ERR</b> if no input is
waiting). If <i>delay</i> is positive, then read blocks for
<i>delay</i> milliseconds, and returns <b>ERR</b> if there
is still no input. Hence, these routines provide the same
functionality as <b>nodelay</b>, plus the additional
capability of being able to block for only <i>delay</i>
milliseconds (where <i>delay</i> is positive).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>curses</b> library does &lsquo;&lsquo;line-breakout
optimization&rsquo;&rsquo; by looking for typeahead
periodically while updating the screen. If input is found,
and it is coming from a tty, the current update is postponed
until <b>refresh</b> or <b>doupdate</b> is called again.
This allows faster response to commands typed in advance.
Normally, the input FILE pointer passed to <b>newterm</b>,
or <b>stdin</b> in the case that <b>initscr</b> was used,
will be used to do this typeahead checking. The
<b>typeahead</b> routine specifies that the file descriptor
<i>fd</i> is to be used to check for typeahead instead. If
<i>fd</i> is &minus;1, then no typeahead checking is
done.</p>

<h2>RETURN VALUE
<a name="RETURN VALUE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">All routines
that return an integer return <b>ERR</b> upon failure and OK
(SVr4 specifies only &quot;an integer value other than
<b>ERR</b>&quot;) upon successful completion, unless
otherwise noted in the preceding routine descriptions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">X/Open does not
define any error conditions. In this implementation,
functions with a window parameter will return an error if it
is null. Any function will also return an error if the
terminal was not initialized. Also,</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>halfdelay</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:29%;">returns an error if its
parameter is outside the range 1..255.</p>

<h2>PORTABILITY
<a name="PORTABILITY"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These functions
are described in the XSI Curses standard, Issue 4.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The ncurses
library obeys the XPG4 standard and the historical practice
of the AT&amp;T curses implementations, in that the echo bit
is cleared when curses initializes the terminal state. BSD
curses differed from this slightly; it left the echo bit on
at initialization, but the BSD <b>raw</b> call turned it off
as a side-effect. For best portability, set echo or noecho
explicitly just after initialization, even if your program
remains in cooked mode.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When
<b>keypad</b> is first enabled, ncurses loads the
key-definitions for the current terminal description. If the
terminal description includes extended string capabilities,
e.g., from using the <b>&minus;x</b> option of tic, then
ncurses also defines keys for the capabilities whose names
begin with &quot;k&quot;. The corresponding keycodes are
generated and (depending on previous loads of terminal
descriptions) may differ from one execution of a program to
the next. The generated keycodes are recognized by the
<b>keyname</b> function (which will then return a name
beginning with &quot;k&quot; denoting the terminfo
capability name rather than &quot;K&quot;, used for curses
key-names). On the other hand, an application can use
<b>define_key</b> to establish a specific keycode for a
given string. This makes it possible for an application to
check for an extended capability&rsquo;s presence with
<i>tigetstr</i>, and reassign the keycode to match its own
needs.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Low-level
applications can use <b>tigetstr</b> to obtain the
definition of any particular string capability. Higher-level
applications which use the curses <b>wgetch</b> and similar
functions to return keycodes rely upon the order in which
the strings are loaded. If more than one key definition has
the same string value, then <b>wgetch</b> can return only
one keycode. Most curses implementations (including ncurses)
load key definitions in the order defined by the array of
string capability names. The last key to be loaded
determines the keycode which will be returned. In ncurses,
you may also have extended capabilities interpreted as key
definitions. These are loaded after the predefined keys, and
if a capability&rsquo;s value is the same as a
previously-loaded key definition, the later definition is
the one used.</p>

<h2>NOTES
<a name="NOTES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
<b>echo</b>, <b>noecho</b>, <b>halfdelay</b>,
<b>intrflush</b>, <b>meta</b>, <b>nodelay</b>,
<b>notimeout</b>, <b>noqiflush</b>, <b>qiflush</b>,
<b>timeout</b>, and <b>wtimeout</b> may be macros.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>noraw</b> and <b>nocbreak</b> calls follow historical
practice in that they attempt to restore to normal
(&lsquo;cooked&rsquo;) mode from raw and cbreak modes
respectively. Mixing raw/noraw and cbreak/nocbreak calls
leads to tty driver control states that are hard to predict
or understand; it is not recommended.</p>
