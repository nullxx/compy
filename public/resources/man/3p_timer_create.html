<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>timer_create</i>() function shall create a per-process
timer using the specified clock, <i>clock_id</i>, as the
timing base. The <i>timer_create</i>() function shall
return, in the location referenced by <i>timerid</i>, a
timer ID of type <b>timer_t</b> used to identify the timer
in timer requests. This timer ID shall be unique within the
calling process until the timer is deleted. The particular
clock, <i>clock_id</i>, is defined in <i>&lt;time.h&gt;</i>.
The timer whose ID is returned shall be in a disarmed state
upon return from <i>timer_create</i>().</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The <i>evp</i>
argument, if non-NULL, points to a <b>sigevent</b>
structure. This structure, allocated by the application,
defines the asynchronous notification to occur as specified
in <i>Signal Generation and Delivery</i> when the timer
expires. If the <i>evp</i> argument is NULL, the effect is
as if the <i>evp</i> argument pointed to a <b>sigevent</b>
structure with the <i>sigev_notify</i> member having the
value SIGEV_SIGNAL, the <i>sigev_signo</i> having a default
signal number, and the <i>sigev_value</i> member having the
value of the timer ID.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Each
implementation shall define a set of clocks that can be used
as timing bases for per-process timers. All implementations
shall support a <i>clock_id</i> of CLOCK_REALTIME. If the
Monotonic Clock option is supported, implementations shall
support a <i>clock_id</i> of CLOCK_MONOTONIC.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Per-process
timers shall not be inherited by a child process across a
<i>fork</i>() and shall be disarmed and deleted by an
<i>exec</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If
_POSIX_CPUTIME is defined, implementations shall support
<i>clock_id</i> values representing the CPU-time clock of
the calling process.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If
_POSIX_THREAD_CPUTIME is defined, implementations shall
support <i>clock_id</i> values representing the CPU-time
clock of the calling thread.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is
implementation-defined whether a <i>timer_create</i>()
function will succeed if the value defined by
<i>clock_id</i> corresponds to the CPU-time clock of a
process or thread different from the process or thread
invoking the function.</p>

<h2>RETURN VALUE
<a name="RETURN VALUE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the call
succeeds, <i>timer_create</i>() shall return zero and update
the location referenced by <i>timerid</i> to a
<b>timer_t</b>, which can be passed to the per-process timer
calls. If an error occurs, the function shall return a value
of -1 and set <i>errno</i> to indicate the error. The value
of <i>timerid</i> is undefined if an error occurs.</p>

<h2>ERRORS

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The

<h2>RATIONALE
<a name="RATIONALE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Periodic
Timer Overrun and Resource Allocation</b> <br>
The specified timer facilities may deliver realtime signals
(that is, queued signals) on implementations that support
this option. Since realtime applications cannot afford to
lose notifications of asynchronous events, like timer
expirations or asynchronous I/O completions, it must be
possible to ensure that sufficient resources exist to
deliver the signal when the event occurs. In general, this
is not a difficulty because there is a one-to-one
correspondence between a request and a subsequent signal
generation. If the request cannot allocate the signal
delivery resources, it can fail the call with an [EAGAIN]
error.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Periodic timers
are a special case. A single request can generate an
unspecified number of signals. This is not a problem if the
requesting process can service the signals as fast as they
are generated, thus making the signal delivery resources
available for delivery of subsequent periodic timer
expiration signals. But, in general, this cannot be
assured-processing of periodic timer signals may
&quot;overrun&rsquo;&rsquo;; that is, subsequent periodic
timer expirations may occur before the currently pending
signal has been delivered.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Also, for
signals, according to the POSIX.1-1990 standard, if
subsequent occurrences of a pending signal are generated, it
is implementation-defined whether a signal is delivered for
each occurrence. This is not adequate for some realtime
applications. So a mechanism is required to allow
applications to detect how many timer expirations were
delayed without requiring an indefinite amount of system
resources to store the delayed expirations.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The specified
facilities provide for an overrun count. The overrun count
is defined as the number of extra timer expirations that
occurred between the time a timer expiration signal is
generated and the time the signal is delivered. The
signal-catching function, if it is concerned with overruns,
can retrieve this count on entry. With this method, a
periodic timer only needs one &quot;signal queuing
resource&quot; that can be allocated at the time of the
<i>timer_create</i>() function call.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A function is
defined to retrieve the overrun count so that an application
need not allocate static storage to contain the count, and
an implementation need not update this storage
asynchronously on timer expirations. But, for some
high-frequency periodic applications, the overhead of an
additional system call on each timer expiration may be
prohibitive. The functions, as defined, permit an
implementation to maintain the overrun count in user space,
associated with the <i>timerid</i>. The
<i>timer_getoverrun</i>() function can then be implemented
as a macro that uses the <i>timerid</i> argument (which may
just be a pointer to a user space structure containing the
counter) to locate the overrun count with no system call
overhead. Other implementations, less concerned with this
class of applications, can avoid the asynchronous update of
user space by maintaining the count in a system structure at
the cost of the extra system call to obtain it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Timer
Expiration Signal Parameters</b> <br>
The Realtime Signals Extension option supports an
application-specific datum that is delivered to the extended
signal handler. This value is explicitly specified by the
application, along with the signal number to be delivered,
in a <b>sigevent</b> structure. The type of the
application-defined value can be either an integer constant
or a pointer. This explicit specification of the value, as
opposed to always sending the timer ID, was selected based
on existing practice.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is common
practice for realtime applications (on non-POSIX systems or
realtime extended POSIX systems) to use the parameters of
event handlers as the case label of a switch statement or as
a pointer to an application-defined data structure. Since
<i>timer_id</i>s are dynamically allocated by the
<i>timer_create</i>() function, they can be used for neither
of these functions without additional application overhead
in the signal handler; for example, to search an array of
saved timer IDs to associate the ID with a constant or
application data structure.</p>
