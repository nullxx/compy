<h2>SAVING AND RE-USING PRECOMPILED PCRE PATTERNS
<a name="SAVING AND RE-USING PRECOMPILED PCRE PATTERNS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you are
running an application that uses a large number of regular
expression patterns, it may be useful to store them in a
precompiled form instead of having to compile them every
time the application is run. If you are not using any
private character tables (see the <b>pcre_maketables()</b>
documentation), this is relatively straightforward. If you
are using private tables, it is a little bit more
complicated. However, if you are using the just-in-time
optimization feature, it is not possible to save and reload
the JIT data.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you save
compiled patterns to a file, you can copy them to a
different host and run them there. If the two hosts have
different endianness (byte order), you should run the
<b>pcre[16|32]_pattern_to_host_byte_order()</b> function on
the new host before trying to match the pattern. The
matching functions return PCRE_ERROR_BADENDIANNESS if they
detect a pattern with the wrong endianness.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Compiling
regular expressions with one version of PCRE for use with a
different version is not guaranteed to work and may cause
crashes, and saving and restoring a compiled pattern loses
any JIT optimization data.</p>

<h2>SAVING A COMPILED PATTERN
<a name="SAVING A COMPILED PATTERN"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The value
returned by <b>pcre[16|32]_compile()</b> points to a single
block of memory that holds the compiled pattern and
associated data. You can find the length of this block in
bytes by calling <b>pcre[16|32]_fullinfo()</b> with an
argument of PCRE_INFO_SIZE. You can then save the data in
any appropriate manner. Here is sample code for the 8-bit
library that compiles a pattern and writes it to a file. It
assumes that the variable <i>fd</i> refers to a file that is
open for output:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">int
erroroffset, rc, size; <br>
char *error; <br>
pcre *re;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">re =
pcre_compile(&quot;my pattern&quot;, 0, &amp;error,
&amp;erroroffset, NULL); <br>
if (re == NULL) { ... handle errors ... } <br>
rc = pcre_fullinfo(re, NULL, PCRE_INFO_SIZE, &amp;size);
<br>
if (rc &lt; 0) { ... handle errors ... } <br>
rc = fwrite(re, 1, size, fd); <br>
if (rc != size) { ... handle errors ... }</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In this
example, the bytes that comprise the compiled pattern are
copied exactly. Note that this is binary data that may
contain any of the 256 possible byte values. On systems that
make a distinction between binary and non-binary data, be
sure that the file is opened for binary output.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you want to
write more than one pattern to a file, you will have to
devise a way of separating them. For binary data, preceding
each pattern with its length is probably the most
straightforward approach. Another possibility is to write
out the data in hexadecimal instead of binary, one pattern
to a line.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Saving compiled
patterns in a file is only one possible way of storing them
for later use. They could equally well be saved in a
database, or in the memory of some daemon process that
passes them via sockets to the processes that want them.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the pattern
has been studied, it is also possible to save the normal
study data in a similar way to the compiled pattern itself.
However, if the PCRE_STUDY_JIT_COMPILE was used, the
just-in-time data that is created cannot be saved because it
is too dependent on the current environment. When studying
generates additional information, <b>pcre[16|32]_study()</b>
returns a pointer to a <b>pcre[16|32]_extra</b> data block.
Its format is defined in the section on matching a pattern
in the <b>pcreapi</b> documentation. The <i>study_data</i>
field points to the binary study data, and this is what you
must save (not the <b>pcre[16|32]_extra</b> block itself).
The length of the study data can be obtained by calling
<b>pcre[16|32]_fullinfo()</b> with an argument of
PCRE_INFO_STUDYSIZE. Remember to check that
<b>pcre[16|32]_study()</b> did return a non-NULL value
before trying to save the study data.</p>

<h2>RE-USING A PRECOMPILED PATTERN
<a name="RE-USING A PRECOMPILED PATTERN"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Re-using a
precompiled pattern is straightforward. Having reloaded it
into main memory, called
<b>pcre[16|32]_pattern_to_host_byte_order()</b> if
necessary, you pass its pointer to <b>pcre[16|32]_exec()</b>
or <b>pcre[16|32]_dfa_exec()</b> in the usual way.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">However, if you
passed a pointer to custom character tables when the pattern
was compiled (the <i>tableptr</i> argument of
<b>pcre[16|32]_compile()</b>), you must now pass a similar
pointer to <b>pcre[16|32]_exec()</b> or
<b>pcre[16|32]_dfa_exec()</b>, because the value saved with
the compiled pattern will obviously be nonsense. A field in
a <b>pcre[16|32]_extra()</b> block is used to pass this
data, as described in the section on matching a pattern in
the <b>pcreapi</b> documentation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you did not
provide custom character tables when the pattern was
compiled, the pointer in the compiled pattern is NULL, which
causes the matching functions to use PCRE&rsquo;s internal
tables. Thus, you do not need to take any special action at
run time in this case.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you saved
study data with the compiled pattern, you need to create
your own <b>pcre[16|32]_extra</b> data block and set the
<i>study_data</i> field to point to the reloaded study data.
You must also set the PCRE_EXTRA_STUDY_DATA bit in the
<i>flags</i> field to indicate that study data is present.
Then pass the <b>pcre[16|32]_extra</b> block to the matching
function in the usual way. If the pattern was studied for
just-in-time optimization, that data cannot be saved, and so
is lost by a save/restore cycle.</p>

<h2>COMPATIBILITY WITH DIFFERENT PCRE RELEASES
<a name="COMPATIBILITY WITH DIFFERENT PCRE RELEASES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In general, it
is safest to recompile all saved patterns when you update to
a new PCRE release, though not all updates actually require
this.</p>
