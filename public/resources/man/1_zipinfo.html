<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>zipinfo</i>
lists technical information about files in a ZIP archive,
most commonly found on MS-DOS systems. Such information
includes file access permissions, encryption status, type of
compression, version and operating system or file system of
compressing program, and the like. The default behavior
(with no options) is to list single-line entries for each
file in the archive, with header and trailer lines providing
summary information for the entire archive. The format is a
cross between Unix &lsquo;&lsquo;<tt>ls
&minus;l</tt>&rsquo;&rsquo; and &lsquo;&lsquo;<tt>unzip
&minus;v</tt>&rsquo;&rsquo; output. See <b>DETAILED
DESCRIPTION</b> below. Note that <i>zipinfo</i> is the same
program as <i>unzip</i> (under Unix, a link to it); on some
systems, however, <i>zipinfo</i> support may have been
omitted when <i>unzip</i> was compiled.</p>

<h2>ARGUMENTS
<a name="ARGUMENTS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>file</i>[<i>.zip</i>]</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Path of the ZIP archive(s). If
the file specification is a wildcard, each matching file is
processed in an order determined by the operating system (or
file system). Only the filename can be a wildcard; the path
itself cannot. Wildcard expressions are similar to Unix
<i>egrep</i>(1) (regular) expressions and may contain:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">

<td width="68%">


<p>matches exactly 1 character</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="22%"></td>
<td width="7%">


<p>[...]</p></td>
<td width="3%"></td>
<td width="68%">


<p>matches any single character found inside the brackets;
ranges are specified by a beginning character, a hyphen, and
an ending character. If an exclamation point or a caret
(&lsquo;!&rsquo; or &lsquo;^&rsquo;) follows the left
bracket, then the range of characters within the brackets is
complemented (that is, anything <i>except</i> the characters
inside the brackets is considered a match). To specify a
verbatim left bracket, the three-character sequence
&lsquo;&lsquo;[[]&rsquo;&rsquo; has to be used.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">(Be sure to
quote any character that might otherwise be interpreted or
modified by the operating system, particularly under Unix
and VMS.) If no matches are found, the specification is
assumed to be a literal filename; and if that also fails,
the suffix <tt>.zip</tt> is appended. Note that
self-extracting ZIP files are supported, as with any other
ZIP archive; just specify the <tt>.exe</tt> suffix (if any)
explicitly.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">[<i>file(s)</i>]</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">An optional list of archive
members to be processed, separated by spaces. (VMS versions
compiled with VMSCLI defined must delimit files with commas
instead.) Regular expressions (wildcards) may be used to
match multiple members; see above. Again, be sure to quote
expressions that would otherwise be expanded or modified by
the operating system.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;">[<b>&minus;x&nbsp;</b><i>xfile(s)</i>]</p>

members to be excluded from processing.</p>

<h2>DETAILED DESCRIPTION
<a name="DETAILED DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>zipinfo</i>
has a number of modes, and its behavior can be rather
difficult to fathom if one isn&rsquo;t familiar with Unix
<i>ls</i>(1) (or even if one is). The default behavior is to
list files in the following format:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">-rw-rws---  1.9 unx    2802 t- defX 11-Aug-91 13:48 perms.2660</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The last three
fields are the modification date and time of the file, and
its name. The case of the filename is respected; thus files
that come from MS-DOS PKZIP are always capitalized. If the
file was zipped with a stored directory name, that is also
displayed as part of the filename.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The second and
third fields indicate that the file was zipped under Unix
with version 1.9 of <i>zip</i>. Since it comes from Unix,
the file permissions at the beginning of the line are
printed in Unix format. The uncompressed file-size (2802 in
this example) is the fourth field.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The fifth field
consists of two characters, either of which may take on
several values. The first character may be either
&lsquo;t&rsquo; or &lsquo;b&rsquo;, indicating that
<i>zip</i> believes the file to be text or binary,
respectively; but if the file is encrypted, <i>zipinfo</i>
notes this fact by capitalizing the character
(&lsquo;T&rsquo; or &lsquo;B&rsquo;). The second character
may also take on four values, depending on whether there is
an extended local header and/or an &lsquo;&lsquo;extra
field&rsquo;&rsquo; associated with the file (fully
explained in PKWare&rsquo;s APPNOTE.TXT, but basically
analogous to pragmas in ANSI C--i.e., they provide a
standard way to include non-standard information in the
archive). If neither exists, the character will be a hyphen
(&lsquo;&minus;&rsquo;); if there is an extended local
header but no extra field, &lsquo;l&rsquo;; if the reverse,
&lsquo;x&rsquo;; and if both exist, &lsquo;X&rsquo;. Thus
the file in this example is (probably) a text file, is not
encrypted, and has neither an extra field nor an extended
local header associated with it. The example below, on the
other hand, is an encrypted binary file with an extra
field:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">RWD,R,R     0.9 vms     168 Bx shrk  9-Aug-91 19:15 perms.0644</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Extra fields
are used for various purposes (see discussion of the
<b>&minus;v</b> option below) including the storage of VMS
file attributes, which is presumably the case here. Note
that the file attributes are listed in VMS format. Some
other possibilities for the host operating system (which is
actually a misnomer--host file system is more correct)
include OS/2 or NT with High Performance File System (HPFS),
MS-DOS, OS/2 or NT with File Allocation Table (FAT) file
system, and Macintosh. These are denoted as follows:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">-rw-a--     1.0 hpf    5358 Tl i4:3  4-Dec-91 11:33 longfilename.hpfs-r--ahs     1.1 fat    4096 b- i4:2 14-Jul-91 12:58 EA DATA. SF--w-------  1.0 mac   17357 bx i8:2  4-May-92 04:02 unzip.macr</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">File attributes
in the first two cases are indicated in a Unix-like format,
where the seven subfields indicate whether the file: (1) is
a directory, (2) is readable (always true), (3) is writable,
(4) is executable (guessed on the basis of the
extension--<i>.exe</i>, <i>.com</i>, <i>.bat</i>,
<i>.cmd</i> and <i>.btm</i> files are assumed to be so), (5)
has its archive bit set, (6) is hidden, and (7) is a system
file. Interpretation of Macintosh file attributes is
unreliable because some Macintosh archivers don&rsquo;t
store any attributes in the archive.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Finally, the
sixth field indicates the compression method and possible
sub-method used. There are six methods known at present:
storing (no compression), reducing, shrinking, imploding,
tokenizing (never publicly released), and deflating. In
addition, there are four levels of reducing (1 through 4);
four types of imploding (4K or 8K sliding dictionary, and 2
or 3 Shannon-Fano trees); and four levels of deflating
(superfast, fast, normal, maximum compression).
<i>zipinfo</i> represents these methods and their
sub-methods as follows: <i>stor</i>; <i>re:1</i>,
<i>re:2</i>, etc.; <i>shrk</i>; <i>i4:2</i>, <i>i8:3</i>,
etc.; <i>tokn</i>; and <i>defS</i>, <i>defF</i>,
<i>defN</i>, and <i>defX</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The medium and
long listings are almost identical to the short format
except that they add information on the file&rsquo;s
compression. The medium format lists the file&rsquo;s
compression factor as a percentage indicating the amount of
space that has been &lsquo;&lsquo;removed&rsquo;&rsquo;:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">-rw-rws---  1.5 unx    2802 t- 81% defX 11-Aug-91 13:48 perms.2660</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In this
example, the file has been compressed by more than a factor
of five; the compressed data are only 19% of the original
size. The long format gives the compressed file&rsquo;s size
in bytes, instead:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">-rw-rws---  1.5 unx    2802 t-     538 defX 11-Aug-91 13:48 perms.2660</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In contrast to
the <i>unzip</i> listings, the compressed size figures in
this listing format denote the complete size of compressed
data, including the 12 extra header bytes in case of
encrypted entries.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Adding the
<b>&minus;T</b> option changes the file date and time to
decimal format:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">-rw-rws---  1.5 unx    2802 t-     538 defX 910811.134804 perms.2660</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
because of limitations in the MS-DOS format used to store
file times, the seconds field is always rounded to the
nearest even second. For Unix files this is expected to
change in the next major releases of <i>zip</i>(1L) and
<i>unzip</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In addition to
individual file information, a default zipfile listing also
includes header and trailer lines:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Archive:  OS2.zip   5453 bytes   5 files,,rw,       1.0 hpf     730 b- i4:3 26-Jun-92 23:40 Contents,,rw,       1.0 hpf    3710 b- i4:3 26-Jun-92 23:33 makefile.os2,,rw,       1.0 hpf    8753 b- i8:3 26-Jun-92 15:29 os2unzip.c,,rw,       1.0 hpf      98 b- stor 21-Aug-91 15:34 unzip.def,,rw,       1.0 hpf      95 b- stor 21-Aug-91 17:51 zipinfo.def5 files, 13386 bytes uncompressed, 4951 bytes compressed:  63.0%</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The header line
gives the name of the archive, its total size, and the total
number of files; the trailer gives the number of files
listed, their total uncompressed size, and their total
compressed size (not including any of <i>zip</i>&rsquo;s
internal overhead). If, however, one or more <i>file(s)</i>
are provided, the header and trailer lines are not listed.
This behavior is also similar to that of Unix&rsquo;s
&lsquo;&lsquo;<tt>ls &minus;l</tt>&rsquo;&rsquo;; it may be
overridden by specifying the <b>&minus;h</b> and
<b>&minus;t</b> options explicitly. In such a case the
listing format must also be specified explicitly, since
<b>&minus;h</b> or <b>&minus;t</b> (or both) in the absence
of other options implies that ONLY the header or trailer
line (or both) is listed. See the <b>EXAMPLES</b> section
below for a semi-intelligible translation of this
nonsense.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The verbose
listing is mostly self-explanatory. It also lists file
comments and the zipfile comment, if any, and the type and
number of bytes in any stored extra fields. Currently known
types of extra fields include PKWARE&rsquo;s authentication
(&lsquo;&lsquo;AV&rsquo;&rsquo;) info; OS/2 extended
attributes; VMS filesystem info, both PKWARE and Info-ZIP
versions; Macintosh resource forks; Acorn/Archimedes SparkFS
info; and so on. (Note that in the case of OS/2 extended
attributes--perhaps the most common use of zipfile extra
fields--the size of the stored EAs as reported by
<i>zipinfo</i> may not match the number given by
OS/2&rsquo;s <i>dir</i> command: OS/2 always reports the
number of bytes required in 16-bit format, whereas
<i>zipinfo</i> always reports the 32-bit storage.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Again, the
compressed size figures of the individual entries include
the 12 extra header bytes for encrypted entries. In
contrast, the archive total compressed size and the average
compression ratio shown in the summary bottom line are
calculated <b>without</b> the extra 12 header bytes of
encrypted entries.</p>

<h2>ENVIRONMENT OPTIONS
<a name="ENVIRONMENT OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Modifying
<i>zipinfo</i>&rsquo;s default behavior via options placed
in an environment variable can be a bit complicated to
explain, due to <i>zipinfo</i>&rsquo;s attempts to handle
various defaults in an intuitive, yet Unix-like, manner.
(Try not to laugh.) Nevertheless, there is some underlying
logic. In brief, there are three &lsquo;&lsquo;priority
levels&rsquo;&rsquo; of options: the default options;
environment options, which can override or add to the
defaults; and explicit options given by the user, which can
override or add to either of the above.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The default
listing format, as noted above, corresponds roughly to the
&quot;<tt>zipinfo &minus;hst</tt>&quot; command (except when
individual zipfile members are specified). A user who
prefers the long-listing format (<b>&minus;l</b>) can make
use of the <i>zipinfo</i>&rsquo;s environment variable to
change this default: <br>
Unix Bourne shell:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><tt>ZIPINFO=&minus;l; export
ZIPINFO</tt></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Unix C shell:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><tt>setenv ZIPINFO
&minus;l</tt></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">OS/2 or MS-DOS:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><tt>set
ZIPINFO=&minus;l</tt></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">VMS (quotes for
<i>lowercase</i>):</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><tt>define ZIPINFO_OPTS
&quot;&minus;l&quot;</tt></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If, in
addition, the user dislikes the trailer line,
<i>zipinfo</i>&rsquo;s concept of &lsquo;&lsquo;negative
options&rsquo;&rsquo; may be used to override the default
inclusion of the line. This is accomplished by preceding the
undesired option with one or more minuses: e.g.,
&lsquo;&lsquo;<tt>&minus;l&minus;t</tt>&rsquo;&rsquo; or
&lsquo;&lsquo;<tt>&minus;&minus;tl</tt>&rsquo;&rsquo;, in
this example. The first hyphen is the regular switch
character, but the one before the &lsquo;t&rsquo; is a minus
sign. The dual use of hyphens may seem a little awkward, but
it&rsquo;s reasonably intuitive nonetheless: simply ignore
the first hyphen and go from there. It is also consistent
with the behavior of the Unix command <i>nice</i>(1).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As suggested
above, the default variable names are ZIPINFO_OPTS for VMS
(where the symbol used to install <i>zipinfo</i> as a
foreign command would otherwise be confused with the
environment variable), and ZIPINFO for all other operating
systems. For compatibility with <i>zip</i>(1L), ZIPINFOOPT
is also accepted (don&rsquo;t ask). If both ZIPINFO and
ZIPINFOOPT are defined, however, ZIPINFO takes precedence.
<i>unzip</i>&rsquo;s diagnostic option (<b>&minus;v</b> with
no zipfile name) can be used to check the values of all four
possible <i>unzip</i> and <i>zipinfo</i> environment
variables.</p>

<h2>EXAMPLES

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To get a basic,

lines, either negate the <b>&minus;h</b> and <b>&minus;t</b>
options or else specify the contents explicitly:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">zipinfo &minus;&minus;h&minus;t storage
zipinfo storage \*</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">(where the
backslash is required only if the shell would otherwise
expand the &lsquo;*&rsquo; wildcard, as in Unix when
globbing is turned on--double quotes around the asterisk
would have worked as well). To turn off the totals line by
default, use the environment variable (C shell is assumed
here):</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">setenv ZIPINFO &minus;&minus;t
zipinfo storage</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To get the
full, short-format listing of the first example again, given
that the environment variable is set as in the previous
example, it is necessary to specify the <b>&minus;s</b>
option explicitly, since the <b>&minus;t</b> option by
itself implies that ONLY the footer line is to be
printed:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">setenv ZIPINFO &minus;&minus;t
zipinfo &minus;t storage            [only totals line]
zipinfo &minus;st storage           [full listing]</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>&minus;s</b> option, like <b>&minus;m</b> and
<b>&minus;l</b>, includes headers and footers by default,
unless otherwise specified. Since the environment variable
specified no footers and that has a higher precedence than
the default behavior of <b>&minus;s</b>, an explicit
<b>&minus;t</b> option was necessary to produce the full
listing. Nothing was indicated about the header, however, so
the <b>&minus;s</b> option was sufficient. Note that both
the <b>&minus;h</b> and <b>&minus;t</b> options, when used
by themselves or with each other, override any default
listing of member files; only the header and/or footer are
printed. This behavior is useful when <i>zipinfo</i> is used
with a wildcard zipfile specification; the contents of all
zipfiles are then summarized with a single command.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To list
information on a single file within the archive, in medium
format, specify the filename explicitly:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">zipinfo &minus;m storage unshrink.c</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
specification of any member file, as in this example, will
override the default header and totals lines; only the
single line of information about the requested file will be
printed. This is intuitively what one would expect when
requesting information about a single file. For multiple
files, it is often useful to know the total compressed and
uncompressed size; in such cases <b>&minus;t</b> may be
specified explicitly:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">zipinfo &minus;mt storage &quot;*.[ch]&quot; Mak\*</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To get maximal
information about the ZIP archive, use the verbose option.
It is usually wise to pipe the output into a filter such as
Unix <i>more</i>(1) if the operating system allows it:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">zipinfo &minus;v storage | more</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Finally, to see
the most recently modified files in the archive, use the
<b>&minus;T</b> option in conjunction with an external
sorting utility such as Unix <i>sort</i>(1) (and
<i>sed</i>(1) as well, in this example):</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">zipinfo &minus;T storage | sort -nr -k 7 | sed 15q</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>&minus;nr</b> option to <i>sort</i>(1) tells it to sort
numerically in reverse order rather than in textual order,
and the <b>&minus;k&nbsp;7</b> option tells it to sort on
the seventh field. This assumes the default short-listing
format; if <b>&minus;m</b> or <b>&minus;l</b> is used, the
proper <i>sort</i>(1) option would be
<b>&minus;k&nbsp;8</b>. Older versions of <i>sort</i>(1) do
not support the <b>&minus;k</b> option, but you can use the
traditional <b>+</b> option instead, e.g., <b>+6</b> instead
of <b>&minus;k&nbsp;7</b>. The <i>sed</i>(1) command filters
out all but the first 15 lines of the listing. Future
releases of <i>zipinfo</i> may incorporate date/time and
filename sorting as built-in options.</p>

<h2>TIPS
<a name="TIPS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The author
finds it convenient to define an alias <i>ii</i> for
<i>zipinfo</i> on systems that allow aliases (or, on other
systems, copy/rename the executable, create a link or create
a command file with the name <i>ii</i>). The <i>ii</i> usage
parallels the common <i>ll</i> alias for long listings in
Unix, and the similarity between the outputs of the two
commands was intentional.</p>

<h2>BUGS
<a name="BUGS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As with
<i>unzip</i>, <i>zipinfo</i>&rsquo;s <b>&minus;M</b>
(&lsquo;&lsquo;more&rsquo;&rsquo;) option is overly
simplistic in its handling of screen output; as noted above,
it fails to detect the wrapping of long lines and may
thereby cause lines at the top of the screen to be scrolled
off before being read. <i>zipinfo</i> should detect and
treat each occurrence of line-wrap as one additional line
printed. This requires knowledge of the screen&rsquo;s width
as well as its height. In addition, <i>zipinfo</i> should
detect the true screen geometry on all systems.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>zipinfo</i>&rsquo;s
listing-format behavior is unnecessarily complex and should
be simplified. (This is not to say that it will be.)</p>
