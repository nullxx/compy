</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>gpg2</b>
&minus; OpenPGP encryption and signing tool</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>gpg2</b>
[<b>&minus;&minus;homedir</b> <i>dir</i>]
[<b>&minus;&minus;options</b> <i>file</i>] [<i>options</i>]
<i>command</i> [<i>args</i>]</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>gpg2</b> is
the OpenPGP part of the GNU Privacy Guard (GnuPG). It is a
tool to provide digital encryption and signing services
using the OpenPGP standard. <b>gpg2</b> features complete
key management and all bells and whistles you can expect
from a decent OpenPGP implementation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In contrast to
the standalone version <b>gpg</b>, which is more suited for
server and embedded platforms, this version is commonly
installed under the name <b>gpg2</b> and more targeted to
the desktop as it requires several other modules to be
installed. The standalone version will be kept maintained
and it is possible to install both versions on the same
system. If you need to use different configuration files,
you should make use of something like
&lsquo;<i>gpg.conf-2</i>&rsquo; instead of just
&lsquo;<i>gpg.conf</i>&rsquo;.</p>

<h2>RETURN VALUE
<a name="RETURN VALUE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The program
returns 0 if everything was fine, 1 if at least a signature
was bad, and other error codes for fatal errors.</p>

<h2>WARNINGS
<a name="WARNINGS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Use a *good*
password for your user account and a *good* passphrase to
protect your secret key. This passphrase is the weakest part
of the whole system. Programs to do dictionary attacks on
your secret keyring are very easy to write and so you should
protect your &quot;~/.gnupg/&quot; directory very well.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Keep in mind
that, if this program is used over a network (telnet), it is
*very* easy to spy out your passphrase!</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you are
going to verify detached signatures, make sure that the
program knows about it; either give both filenames on the
command line or use '-' to specify STDIN.</p>

<h2>INTEROPERABILITY
<a name="INTEROPERABILITY"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">GnuPG tries to
be a very flexible implementation of the OpenPGP standard.
In particular, GnuPG implements many of the optional parts
of the standard, such as the SHA-512 hash, and the ZLIB and
BZIP2 compression algorithms. It is important to be aware
that not all OpenPGP programs implement these optional
algorithms and that by forcing their use via the
<b>--cipher-algo</b>, <b>--digest-algo</b>,
<b>--cert-digest-algo</b>, or <b>--compress-algo</b> options
in GnuPG, it is possible to create a perfectly valid OpenPGP
message, but one that cannot be read by the intended
recipient.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There are
dozens of variations of OpenPGP programs available, and each
supports a slightly different subset of these optional
algorithms. For example, until recently, no (unhacked)
version of PGP supported the BLOWFISH cipher algorithm. A
message using BLOWFISH simply could not be read by a PGP
user. By default, GnuPG uses the standard OpenPGP
preferences system that will always do the right thing and
create messages that are usable by all recipients,
regardless of which OpenPGP program they use. Only override
this safe default if you really know what you are doing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you
absolutely must override the safe default, or if the
preferences on a given key are invalid for some reason, you
are far better off using the <b>--pgp6</b>, <b>--pgp7</b>,
or <b>--pgp8</b> options. These options are safe as they do
not force any particular algorithms in violation of OpenPGP,
but rather reduce the available algorithms to a
&quot;PGP-safe&quot; list.</p>

<h2>COMMANDS
<a name="COMMANDS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Commands are
not distinguished from options except for the fact that only
one command is allowed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>gpg2</b> may
be run with no commands, in which case it will perform a
reasonable action depending on the type of file it is given
as input (an encrypted message is decrypted, a signature is
verified, a file containing keys is listed).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Please remember
that option as well as command parsing stops as soon as a
non-option is encountered, you can explicitly stop parsing
by using the special option <b>--</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Commands not
specific to the function &nbsp; <br>
--version</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Print the program version and
licensing information. Note that you cannot abbreviate this
command.</p>

<p>Make a signature. This command may be combined with
<b>--encrypt</b> (for a signed and encrypted message),
<b>--symmetric</b> (for a signed and symmetrically encrypted
message), or <b>--encrypt</b> and <b>--symmetric</b>
together (for a signed message that may be decrypted via a
secret key or a passphrase). The key to be used for signing
is chosen by default or can be set with the
<b>--local-user</b> and <b>--default-key</b> options.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--clearsign</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Make a clear text signature.
The content in a clear text signature is readable without
any special software. OpenPGP software is only needed to
verify the signature. Clear text signatures may modify
end-of-line whitespace for platform independence and are not
intended to be reversible. The key to be used for signing is
chosen by default or can be set with the <b>--local-user</b>
and <b>--default-key</b> options.</p>

<p>Encrypt data. This option may be combined with
<b>--sign</b> (for a signed and encrypted message),
<b>--symmetric</b> (for a message that may be decrypted via
a secret key or a passphrase), or <b>--sign</b> and
<b>--symmetric</b> together (for a signed message that may
be decrypted via a secret key or a passphrase).</p></td></tr>

<td width="8%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>Encrypt with a symmetric cipher using a passphrase. The
default symmetric cipher used is CAST5, but may be chosen
with the <b>--cipher-algo</b> option. This option may be
combined with <b>--sign</b> (for a signed and symmetrically
encrypted message), <b>--encrypt</b> (for a message that may
be decrypted via a secret key or a passphrase), or
<b>--sign</b> and <b>--encrypt</b> together (for a signed
message that may be decrypted via a secret key or a
passphrase).</p> </td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--store</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Store only (make a simple
RFC1991 literal data packet).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--decrypt</b></p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"

<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p><b>-d</b></p></td>
<td width="8%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>Decrypt the file given on the command line (or STDIN if
no file is specified) and write it to STDOUT (or the file
specified with <b>--output</b>). If the decrypted file is
signed, the signature is also verified. This command differs
from the default operation, as it never writes to the
filename which is included in the file and it rejects files
which don&rsquo;t begin with an encrypted message.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--verify</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Assume that the first argument
is a signed file or a detached signature and verify it
without generating any output. With no arguments, the
signature packet is read from STDIN. If only a sigfile is
given, it may be a complete signature or a detached
signature, in which case the signed stuff is expected in a
file without the &quot;.sig&quot; or &quot;.asc&quot;
extension. With more than 1 argument, the first should be a
detached signature and the remaining files are the signed
stuff. To read the signed stuff from STDIN, use '-' as the
second filename. For security reasons a detached signature
cannot read the signed material from STDIN without denoting
it in the above way.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Note: When
verifying a cleartext signature, <b>gpg</b> verifies only
what makes up the cleartext signed data and not any extra
data outside of the cleartext signature or header lines
following directly the dash marker line. The option
<b>--output</b> may be used to write out the actual signed
data; but there are other pitfalls with this format as well.
It is suggested to avoid cleartext signatures in favor of
detached signatures.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--multifile</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This modifies certain other
commands to accept multiple files for processing on the
command line or read from STDIN with each filename on a
separate line. This allows for many files to be processed at
once. <b>--multifile</b> may currently be used along with
<b>--verify</b>, <b>--encrypt</b>, and <b>--decrypt</b>.
Note that <b>--multifile --verify</b> may not be used with
detached signatures.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--verify-files</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Identical to <b>--multifile
--verify</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--encrypt-files</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Identical to <b>--multifile
--encrypt</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--decrypt-files</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Identical to <b>--multifile
--decrypt</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--list-keys</b></p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

<p><b>-k</b></p></td>
<td width="86%">
</td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--list-public-keys</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">List all keys from the public
keyrings, or just the keys given on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Avoid using the
output of this command in scripts or other programs as it is
likely to change as GnuPG changes. See <b>--with-colons</b>
for a machine-parseable key listing command that is
appropriate for use in scripts and other programs.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--list-secret-keys</b></p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p><b>-K</b></p></td>
<td width="8%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>List all keys from the secret keyrings, or just the ones
given on the command line. A <b>#</b> after the letters
<b>sec</b> means that the secret key is not usable (for
example, if it was created via
<b>--export-secret-subkeys</b>).</p> </td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--list-sigs</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Same as <b>--list-keys</b>, but
the signatures are listed too. This command has the same
effect as using <b>--list-keys</b> with
<b>--with-sig-list</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">For each
signature listed, there are several flags in between the
&quot;sig&quot; tag and keyid. These flags give additional
information about each signature. From left to right, they
are the numbers 1-3 for certificate check level (see
<b>--ask-cert-level</b>), &quot;L&quot; for a local or
non-exportable signature (see <b>--lsign-key</b>),
&quot;R&quot; for a nonRevocable signature (see the
<b>--edit-key</b> command &quot;nrsign&quot;), &quot;P&quot;
for a signature that contains a policy URL (see
<b>--cert-policy-url</b>), &quot;N&quot; for a signature
that contains a notation (see <b>--cert-notation</b>),
&quot;X&quot; for an eXpired signature (see
<b>--ask-cert-expire</b>), and the numbers 1-9 or
&quot;T&quot; for 10 and above to indicate trust signature
levels (see the <b>--edit-key</b> command
&quot;tsign&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--check-sigs</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Same as <b>--list-sigs</b>, but
the signatures are verified. Note that for performance
reasons the revocation status of a signing key is not shown.
This command has the same effect as using <b>--list-keys</b>
with <b>--with-sig-check</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The status of
the verification is indicated by a flag directly following
the &quot;sig&quot; tag (and thus before the flags described
above for <b>--list-sigs</b>). A &quot;!&quot; indicates
that the signature has been successfully verified, a
&quot;-&quot; denotes a bad signature and a &quot;%&quot; is
used if an error occurred while checking the signature (e.g.
a non supported algorithm).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--locate-keys</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Locate the keys given as
arguments. This command basically uses the same algorithm as
used when locating keys for encryption or signing and may
thus be used to see what keys <b>gpg2</b> might use. In
particular external methods as defined by
<b>--auto-key-locate</b> may be used to locate a key. Only
public keys are listed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--fingerprint</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">List all keys (or the specified
ones) along with their fingerprints. This is the same output
as <b>--list-keys</b> but with the additional output of a
line with the fingerprint. May also be combined with
<b>--list-sigs</b> or <b>--check-sigs</b>. If this command
is given twice, the fingerprints of all secondary keys are
listed too.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--list-packets</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">List only the sequence of
packets. This is mainly useful for debugging.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--card-edit</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Present a menu to work with a
smartcard. The subcommand &quot;help&quot; provides an
overview on available commands. For a detailed description,
please see the Card HOWTO at
http://www.gnupg.org/documentation/howtos.html#GnuPG-cardHOWTO
.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--card-status</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Show the content of the smart
card.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--change-pin</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Present a menu to allow
changing the PIN of a smartcard. This functionality is also
available as the subcommand &quot;passwd&quot; with the
<b>--card-edit</b> command.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--delete-key name</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Remove key from the public
keyring. In batch mode either <b>--yes</b> is required or
the key must be specified by fingerprint. This is a
safeguard against accidental deletion of multiple keys.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--delete-secret-key
name</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Remove key from the secret
keyring. In batch mode the key must be specified by
fingerprint.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--delete-secret-and-public-key
name</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Same as <b>--delete-key</b>,
but if a secret key exists, it will be removed first. In
batch mode the key must be specified by fingerprint.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--export</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Either export all keys from all
keyrings (default keyrings and those registered via option
<b>--keyring</b>), or if at least one name is given, those
of the given name. The new keyring is written to STDOUT or
to the file given with option <b>--output</b>. Use together
with <b>--armor</b> to mail those keys.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--send-keys key IDs</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Similar to <b>--export</b> but
sends the keys to a keyserver. Fingerprints may be used
instead of key IDs. Option <b>--keyserver</b> must be used
to give the name of this keyserver. Don&rsquo;t send your
complete keyring to a keyserver --- select only those keys
which are new or changed by you. If no key IDs are given,
<b>gpg</b> does nothing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--export-secret-keys <br>
--export-secret-subkeys</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Same as <b>--export</b>, but
exports the secret keys instead. This is normally not very
useful and a security risk. The second form of the command
has the special property to render the secret part of the
primary key useless; this is a GNU extension to OpenPGP and
other implementations can not be expected to successfully
import such a key. See the option
<b>--simple-sk-checksum</b> if you want to import such an
exported key with an older OpenPGP implementation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--import <br>
--fast-import</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Import/merge keys. This adds
the given keys to the keyring. The fast version is currently
just a synonym.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">There are a few
other options which control how this command works. Most
notable here is the <b>--import-options merge-only</b>
option which does not insert new keys but does only the
merging of new signatures, user-IDs and subkeys.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--recv-keys key IDs</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Import the keys with the given
key IDs from a keyserver. Option <b>--keyserver</b> must be
used to give the name of this keyserver.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--refresh-keys</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Request updates from a
keyserver for keys that already exist on the local keyring.
This is useful for updating a key with the latest
signatures, user IDs, etc. Calling this with no arguments
will refresh the entire keyring. Option <b>--keyserver</b>
must be used to give the name of the keyserver for all keys
that do not have preferred keyservers set (see
<b>--keyserver-options honor-keyserver-url</b>).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--search-keys names</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Search the keyserver for the
given names. Multiple names given here will be joined
together to create the search string for the keyserver.
Option <b>--keyserver</b> must be used to give the name of
this keyserver. Keyservers that support different search
methods allow using the syntax specified in &quot;How to
specify a user ID&quot; below. Note that different keyserver
types support different search methods. Currently only LDAP
supports them all.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--fetch-keys URIs</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Retrieve keys located at the
specified URIs. Note that different installations of GnuPG
may support different protocols (HTTP, FTP, LDAP, etc.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--update-trustdb</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Do trust database maintenance.
This command iterates over all keys and builds the Web of
Trust. This is an interactive command because it may have to
ask for the &quot;ownertrust&quot; values for keys. The user
has to give an estimation of how far she trusts the owner of
the displayed key to correctly certify (sign) other keys.
GnuPG only asks for the ownertrust value if it has not yet
been assigned to a key. Using the <b>--edit-key</b> menu,
the assigned value can be changed at any time.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--check-trustdb</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Do trust database maintenance
without user interaction. From time to time the trust
database must be updated so that expired keys or signatures
and the resulting changes in the Web of Trust can be
tracked. Normally, GnuPG will calculate when this is
required and do it automatically unless
<b>--no-auto-check-trustdb</b> is set. This command can be
used to force a trust database check at any time. The
processing is identical to that of <b>--update-trustdb</b>
but it skips keys with a not yet defined
&quot;ownertrust&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">For use with
cron jobs, this command can be used together with
<b>--batch</b> in which case the trust database check is
done only if a check is needed. To force a run even in batch
mode add the option <b>--yes</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--export-ownertrust</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Send the ownertrust values to
STDOUT. This is useful for backup purposes as these values
are the only ones which can&rsquo;t be re-created from a
corrupted trustdb. Example:</p>

<p style="margin-left:25%;">gpg2 --export-ownertrust &gt;
otrust.txt</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--import-ownertrust</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Update the trustdb with the
ownertrust values stored in <b>files</b> (or STDIN if not
given); existing values will be overwritten. In case of a
severely damaged trustdb and if you have a recent backup of
the ownertrust values (e.g. in the file
&lsquo;<i>otrust.txt</i>&rsquo;, you may re-create the
trustdb using these commands:</p>

<p style="margin-left:25%;">cd ~/.gnupg <br>
rm trustdb.gpg <br>
gpg2 --import-ownertrust &lt; otrust.txt</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--rebuild-keydb-caches</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">When updating from version
1.0.6 to 1.0.7 this command should be used to create
signature caches in the keyring. It might be handy in other
situations too.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--print-md algo <br>
--print-mds</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Print message digest of
algorithm ALGO for all given files or STDIN. With the second
form (or a deprecated &quot;*&quot; as algo) digests for all
available algorithms are printed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--gen-random 0|1|2
count</b></p>

preference list to the default (either built-in or set via
<b>--default-preference-list</b>), and calling setpref with
&quot;none&quot; as the argument sets an empty preference
list. Use <b>gpg2 --version</b> to get a list of available
algorithms. Note that while you can change the preferences
on an attribute user ID (aka &quot;photo ID&quot;), GnuPG
does not select keys via attribute user IDs so these
preferences will not be used by GnuPG.</p>

<p style="margin-left:32%; margin-top: 1em">When setting
preferences, you should list the algorithms in the order
which you&rsquo;d like to see them used by someone else when
encrypting a message to your key. If you don&rsquo;t include
3DES, it will be automatically added at the end. Note that
there are many factors that go into choosing an algorithm
(for example, your key may not be the only recipient), and
so the remote OpenPGP application being used to send to you
may or may not follow your exact chosen order for a given
message. It will, however, only choose an algorithm that is
present on the preference list of every recipient key. See

use this command only with the corresponding public key and

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>show-unusable-subkeys</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Show revoked and expired
subkeys in key listings. Defaults to no.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>show-keyring</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Display the keyring name at the
head of key listings to show which keyring a given key
resides on. Defaults to no.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>show-sig-expire</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Show signature expiration dates
(if any) during <b>--list-sigs</b> or <b>--check-sigs</b>
listings. Defaults to no.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>show-sig-subpackets</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Include signature subpackets in
the key listing. This option can take an optional argument
list of the subpackets to list. If no argument is passed,
list all subpackets. Defaults to no. This option is only
meaningful when using <b>--with-colons</b> along with
<b>--list-sigs</b> or <b>--check-sigs</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--verify-options
parameters</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This is a space or comma
delimited string that gives options used when verifying
signatures. Options can be prepended with a
&lsquo;no-&rsquo; to give the opposite meaning. The options
are: <b><br>
show-photos</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Display any photo IDs present
on the key that issued the signature. Defaults to no. See
also <b>--photo-viewer</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>show-policy-urls</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Show policy URLs in the
signature being verified. Defaults to no.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>show-notations <br>
show-std-notations <br>
show-user-notations</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Show all, IETF standard, or
user-defined signature notations in the signature being
verified. Defaults to IETF standard.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>show-keyserver-urls</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Show any preferred keyserver
URL in the signature being verified. Defaults to no.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>show-uid-validity</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Display the calculated validity
of the user IDs on the key that issued the signature.
Defaults to no.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>show-unusable-uids</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Show revoked and expired user
IDs during signature verification. Defaults to no.</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>show-primary-uid-only</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Show only the primary user ID
during signature verification. That is all the AKA lines as
well as photo Ids are not shown with the signature
verification status.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>pka-lookups</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Enable PKA lookups to verify
sender addresses. Note that PKA is based on DNS, and so
enabling this option may disclose information on when and
what signatures are verified or to whom data is encrypted.
This is similar to the &quot;web bug&quot; described for the
auto-key-retrieve feature.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>pka-trust-increase</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Raise the trust in a signature
to full if the signature passes PKA validation. This option
is only meaningful if pka-lookups is set.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--enable-dsa2 <br>
--disable-dsa2</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Enable hash truncation for all
DSA keys even for old DSA Keys up to 1024 bit. This is also
the default with <b>--openpgp</b>. Note that older versions
of GnuPG also required this flag to allow the generation of
DSA larger than 1024 bit.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--photo-viewer
string</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This is the command line that
should be run to view a photo ID. &quot;%i&quot; will be
expanded to a filename containing the photo. &quot;%I&quot;
does the same, except the file will not be deleted once the
viewer exits. Other flags are &quot;%k&quot; for the key ID,
&quot;%K&quot; for the long key ID, &quot;%f&quot; for the
key fingerprint, &quot;%t&quot; for the extension of the
image type (e.g. &quot;jpg&quot;), &quot;%T&quot; for the
MIME type of the image (e.g. &quot;image/jpeg&quot;),
&quot;%v&quot; for the single-character calculated validity
of the image being viewed (e.g. &quot;f&quot;),
&quot;%V&quot; for the calculated validity as a string (e.g.
&quot;full&quot;), and &quot;%%&quot; for an actual percent
sign. If neither %i or %I are present, then the photo will
be supplied to the viewer on standard input.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The default
viewer is &quot;xloadimage -fork -quiet -title &rsquo;KeyID
0x%k&rsquo; STDIN&quot;. Note that if your image viewer
program is not secure, then executing it from GnuPG does not
make it secure.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--exec-path string</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Sets a list of directories to
search for photo viewers and keyserver helpers. If not
provided, keyserver helpers use the compiled-in default
directory, and photo viewers use the $PATH environment
variable. Note, that on W32 system this value is ignored
when searching for keyserver helpers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--keyring file</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Add <b>file</b> to the current
list of keyrings. If <b>file</b> begins with a tilde and a
slash, these are replaced by the $HOME directory. If the
filename does not contain a slash, it is assumed to be in
the GnuPG home directory (&quot;~/.gnupg&quot; if
<b>--homedir</b> or $GNUPGHOME is not used).</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Note that this
adds a keyring to the current list. If the intent is to use
the specified keyring alone, use <b>--keyring</b> along with
<b>--no-default-keyring</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--secret-keyring
file</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Same as <b>--keyring</b> but
for the secret keyrings.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--primary-keyring
file</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Designate <b>file</b> as the
primary public keyring. This means that newly imported keys
(via <b>--import</b> or keyserver <b>--recv-from</b>) will
go to this keyring.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--trustdb-name file</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Use <b>file</b> instead of the
default trustdb. If <b>file</b> begins with a tilde and a
slash, these are replaced by the $HOME directory. If the
filename does not contain a slash, it is assumed to be in
the GnuPG home directory (&lsquo;<i>~/.gnupg</i>&rsquo; if
<b>--homedir</b> or $GNUPGHOME is not used).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--homedir</b> <i>dir</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set the name of the home
directory to <i>dir</i>. If this option is not used, the
home directory defaults to &lsquo;<i>~/.gnupg</i>&rsquo;. It
is only recognized when given on the command line. It also
overrides any home directory stated through the environment
variable &lsquo;<i>GNUPGHOME</i>&rsquo; or (on W32 systems)
by means of the Registry entry
<i>HKCU\Software\GNU\GnuPG:HomeDir</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--display-charset
name</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set the name of the native
character set. This is used to convert some informational
strings like user IDs to the proper UTF-8 encoding. Note
that this has nothing to do with the character set of data
to be encrypted or signed; GnuPG does not recode
user-supplied data. If this option is not used, the default
character set is determined from the current locale. A
verbosity level of 3 shows the chosen set. Valid values for
<b>name</b> are: <b><br>
iso-8859-1</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">This is the Latin 1 set.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>iso-8859-2</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">The Latin 2 set.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>iso-8859-15</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">This is currently an alias for
the Latin 1 set.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Assume that command line
arguments are given as UTF8 strings. The default
(<b>--no-utf8-strings</b>) is to assume that arguments are
encoded in the character set as specified by
<b>--display-charset</b>. These options affect all following
arguments. Both options may be used multiple times.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--options file</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Read options from <b>file</b>
and do not try to read them from the default options file in
the homedir (see <b>--homedir</b>). This option is ignored
if used in an options file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--no-options</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Shortcut for <b>--options
/dev/null</b>. This option is detected before an attempt to
open an option file. Using this option will also prevent the
creation of a &lsquo;<i>~/.gnupg</i>&rsquo; homedir.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--compress-level n <br>
--bzip2-compress-level n</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set compression level to
<b>n</b> for the ZIP and ZLIB compression algorithms. The
default is to use the default compression level of zlib
(normally 6). <b>--bzip2-compress-level</b> sets the
compression level for the BZIP2 compression algorithm
(defaulting to 6 as well). This is a different option from
<b>--compress-level</b> since BZIP2 uses a significant
amount of memory for each additional compression level.
<b>-z</b> sets both. A value of 0 for <b>n</b> disables
compression.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--bzip2-decompress-lowmem</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Use a different decompression
method for BZIP2 compressed files. This alternate method
uses a bit more than half the memory, but also runs at half
the speed. This is useful under extreme low memory
circumstances when the file was originally compressed at a
high <b>--bzip2-compress-level</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--mangle-dos-filenames <br>
--no-mangle-dos-filenames</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Older version of Windows cannot
handle filenames with more than one dot.
<b>--mangle-dos-filenames</b> causes GnuPG to replace
(rather than add to) the extension of an output filename to
avoid this problem. This option is off by default and has no
effect on non-Windows platforms.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--ask-cert-level <br>
--no-ask-cert-level</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">When making a key signature,
prompt for a certification level. If this option is not
specified, the certification level used is set via
<b>--default-cert-level</b>. See <b>--default-cert-level</b>
for information on the specific levels and how they are
used. <b>--no-ask-cert-level</b> disables this option. This
option defaults to no.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--default-cert-level
n</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The default to use for the
check level when signing a key.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">0 means you
make no particular claim as to how carefully you verified
the key.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">1 means you
believe the key is owned by the person who claims to own it
but you could not, or did not verify the key at all. This is
useful for a &quot;persona&quot; verification, where you
sign the key of a pseudonymous user.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">2 means you did
casual verification of the key. For example, this could mean
that you verified the key fingerprint and checked the user
ID on the key against a photo ID.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">3 means you did
extensive verification of the key. For example, this could
mean that you verified the key fingerprint with the owner of
the key in person, and that you checked, by means of a hard
to forge document with a photo ID (such as a passport) that
the name of the key owner matches the name in the user ID on
the key, and finally that you verified (by exchange of
email) that the email address on the key belongs to the key
owner.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Note that the
examples given above for levels 2 and 3 are just that:
examples. In the end, it is up to you to decide just what
&quot;casual&quot; and &quot;extensive&quot; mean to
you.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">This option
defaults to 0 (no particular claim).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--min-cert-level</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">When building the trust
database, treat any signatures with a certification level
below this as invalid. Defaults to 2, which disregards level
1 signatures. Note that level 0 &quot;no particular
claim&quot; signatures are always accepted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--trusted-key long key
ID</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Assume that the specified key
(which must be given as a full 8 byte key ID) is as
trustworthy as one of your own secret keys. This option is
useful if you don&rsquo;t want to keep your secret keys (or
one of them) online but still want to be able to check the
validity of a given recipient&rsquo;s or signator&rsquo;s
key.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--trust-model

when encrypting to an email address (in the
&quot;user@example.com&quot; form), and there are no
user@example.com keys on the local keyring. This option

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>keyserver-URL</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">In addition, a keyserver URL as

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>nodefault</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">This flag disables the standard
local key lookup, done before any of the mechanisms defined
by the <b>--auto-key-locate</b> are tried. The position of
this mechanism in the list does not matter. It is not
required if <b>local</b> is also used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--keyid-format
short|0xshort|long|0xlong</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Select how to display key IDs.
&quot;short&quot; is the traditional 8-character key ID.
&quot;long&quot; is the more accurate (but less convenient)
16-character key ID. Add an &quot;0x&quot; to either to
include an &quot;0x&quot; at the beginning of the key ID, as
in 0x99242560. Note that this option is ignored if the
option --with-colons is used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--keyserver name</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Use <b>name</b> as your
keyserver. This is the server that <b>--recv-keys</b>,
<b>--send-keys</b>, and <b>--search-keys</b> will
communicate with to receive keys from, send keys to, and
search for keys on. The format of the <b>name</b> is a URI:
&lsquo;scheme:[//]keyservername[:port]&rsquo; The scheme is
the type of keyserver: &quot;hkp&quot; for the HTTP (or
compatible) keyservers, &quot;ldap&quot; for the LDAP
keyservers, or &quot;mailto&quot; for the Graff email
keyserver. Note that your particular installation of GnuPG
may have other keyserver types available as well. Keyserver
schemes are case-insensitive. After the keyserver name,
optional keyserver configuration options may be provided.
These are the same as the global <b>--keyserver-options</b>
from below, but apply only to this particular keyserver.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Most keyservers
synchronize with each other, so there is generally no need
to send keys to more than one server. The keyserver
<b>hkp://keys.gnupg.net</b> uses round robin DNS to give a
different keyserver each time you use it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--keyserver-options
name=value1</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This is a space or comma
delimited string that gives options for the keyserver.
Options can be prefixed with a &lsquo;no-&rsquo; to give the
opposite meaning. Valid import-options or export-options may
be used here as well to apply to importing
(<b>--recv-key</b>) or exporting (<b>--send-key</b>) a key
from a keyserver. While not all options are available for
all keyserver types, some common options are: <b><br>
include-revoked</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">When searching for a key with
<b>--search-keys</b>, include keys that are marked on the
keyserver as revoked. Note that not all keyservers
differentiate between revoked and unrevoked keys, and for
such keyservers this option is meaningless. Note also that
most keyservers do not have cryptographic verification of
key revocations, and so turning this option off may result
in skipping keys that are incorrectly marked as revoked.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>include-disabled</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">When searching for a key with
<b>--search-keys</b>, include keys that are marked on the
keyserver as disabled. Note that this option is not used
with HKP keyservers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>auto-key-retrieve</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">This option enables the
automatic retrieving of keys from a keyserver when verifying
signatures made by keys that are not on the local
keyring.</p>

<p style="margin-left:32%; margin-top: 1em">Note that this
option makes a &quot;web bug&quot; like behavior possible.
Keyserver operators can see which keys you request, so by
sending you a message signed by a brand new key (which you
naturally will not have on your local keyring), the operator
can tell both your IP address and the time when you verified
the signature.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>honor-keyserver-url</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">When using
<b>--refresh-keys</b>, if the key in question has a
preferred keyserver URL, then use that preferred keyserver
to refresh the key from. In addition, if auto-key-retrieve
is set, and the signature being verified has a preferred
keyserver URL, then use that preferred keyserver to fetch
the key from. Defaults to yes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>honor-pka-record</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">If auto-key-retrieve is set,
and the signature being verified has a PKA record, then use
the PKA information to fetch the key. Defaults to yes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>include-subkeys</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">When receiving a key, include
subkeys as potential targets. Note that this option is not
used with HKP keyservers, as they do not support retrieving
keys by subkey id.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>use-temp-files</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">On most Unix-like platforms,
GnuPG communicates with the keyserver helper program via
pipes, which is the most efficient method. This option
forces GnuPG to use temporary files to communicate. On some
platforms (such as Win32 and RISC OS), this option is always
enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>keep-temp-files</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">If using
&lsquo;use-temp-files&rsquo;, do not delete the temp files
after using them. This option is useful to learn the
keyserver communication protocol by reading the temporary
files.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>verbose</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Tell the keyserver helper
program to be more verbose. This option can be repeated
multiple times to increase the verbosity level.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>timeout</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Tell the keyserver helper
program how long (in seconds) to try and perform a keyserver
action before giving up. Note that performing multiple
actions at the same time uses this timeout value per action.
For example, when retrieving multiple keys via
<b>--recv-keys</b>, the timeout applies separately to each
key retrieval, and not to the <b>--recv-keys</b> command as
a whole. Defaults to 30 seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>http-proxy=value</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Set the proxy to use for HTTP
and HKP keyservers. This overrides the
&quot;http_proxy&quot; environment variable, if any.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>max-cert-size</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">When retrieving a key via DNS
CERT, only accept keys up to this size. Defaults to 16384
bytes.</p>

</table>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>check-cert</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Enable certificate checking if

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Provide a certificate store to
override the system default. Only necessary if check-cert is
enabled, and the keyserver is using a certificate that is
not present in a system default certificate list.</p>

<p style="margin-left:32%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
depending on the SSL library that the keyserver helper is
built with, this may actually be a directory or a file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--completes-needed n</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Number of completely trusted
users to introduce a new key signer (defaults to 1).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--marginals-needed n</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Number of marginally trusted
users to introduce a new key signer (defaults to 3)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--max-cert-depth n</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Maximum depth of a
certification chain (default is 5).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--simple-sk-checksum</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Secret keys are integrity
protected by using a SHA-1 checksum. This method is part of
the upcoming enhanced OpenPGP specification but GnuPG
already uses it as a countermeasure against certain attacks.
Old applications don&rsquo;t understand this new format, so
this option may be used to switch back to the old behaviour.
Using this option bears a security risk. Note that using
this option only takes effect when the secret key is
encrypted - the simplest way to make this happen is to
change the passphrase on the key (even changing it to the
same value is acceptable).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--no-sig-cache</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Do not cache the verification
status of key signatures. Caching gives a much better
performance in key listings. However, if you suspect that
your public keyring is not save against write modifications,
you can use this option to disable the caching. It probably
does not make sense to disable it because all kind of damage
can be done if someone else has write access to your public
keyring.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--no-sig-create-check</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">GnuPG normally verifies each
signature right after creation to protect against bugs and
hardware malfunctions which could leak out bits from the
secret key. This extra verification needs some time (about
115% for DSA keys), and so this option can be used to
disable it. However, due to the fact that the signature
creation needs manual interaction, this performance penalty
does not matter in most settings.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--auto-check-trustdb <br>
--no-auto-check-trustdb</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If GnuPG feels that its
information about the Web of Trust has to be updated, it
automatically runs the <b>--check-trustdb</b> command
internally. This may be a time consuming process.
<b>--no-auto-check-trustdb</b> disables this option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--use-agent <br>
--no-use-agent</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This is dummy option.
<b>gpg2</b> always requires the agent.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--gpg-agent-info</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This is dummy option. It has no
effect when used with <b>gpg2</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--lock-once</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Lock the databases the first
time a lock is requested and do not release the lock until
the process terminates.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--lock-multiple</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Release the locks every time a
lock is no longer needed. Use this to override a previous
<b>--lock-once</b> from a config file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--lock-never</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Disable locking entirely. This
option should be used only in very special environments,
where it can be assured that only one process is accessing
those files. A bootable floppy with a stand-alone encryption
system will probably use this. Improper usage of this option
may lead to data and key corruption.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--exit-on-status-write-error</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This option will cause write
errors on the status FD to immediately terminate the
process. That should in fact be the default but it never
worked this way and thus we need an option to enable this,
so that the change won&rsquo;t break applications which
close their end of a status fd connected pipe too early.
Using this option along with <b>--enable-progress-filter</b>
may be used to cleanly cancel long running gpg
operations.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--limit-card-insert-tries
n</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">With <b>n</b> greater than 0
the number of prompts asking to insert a smartcard gets
limited to N-1. Thus with a value of 1 gpg won&rsquo;t at
all ask to insert a card if none has been inserted at
startup. This option is useful in the configuration file in
case an application does not know about the smartcard
support and waits ad infinitum for an inserted card.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--no-random-seed-file</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">GnuPG uses a file to store its
internal random pool over invocations. This makes random
generation faster; however sometimes write operations are
not desired. This option can be used to achieve that with
the cost of slower random generation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--no-greeting</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Suppress the initial copyright
message.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--no-secmem-warning</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Suppress the warning about
&quot;using insecure memory&quot;.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--no-permission-warning</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Suppress the warning about
unsafe file and home directory (<b>--homedir</b>)
permissions. Note that the permission checks that GnuPG
performs are not intended to be authoritative, but rather
they simply warn about certain common permission problems.
Do not assume that the lack of a warning means that your
system is secure.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Note that the
warning for unsafe <b>--homedir</b> permissions cannot be
suppressed in the gpg.conf file, as this would allow an
attacker to place an unsafe gpg.conf file in place, and use
this file to suppress warnings about itself. The
<b>--homedir</b> permissions warning may only be suppressed
on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--no-mdc-warning</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Suppress the warning about
missing MDC integrity protection.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--require-secmem <br>
--no-require-secmem</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Refuse to run if GnuPG cannot
get secure memory. Defaults to no (i.e. run, but give a
warning).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--require-cross-certification
<br>
--no-require-cross-certification</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">When verifying a signature made
from a subkey, ensure that the cross certification
&quot;back signature&quot; on the subkey is present and
valid. This protects against a subtle attack against subkeys
that can sign. Defaults to
<b>--require-cross-certification</b> for <b>gpg2</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--expert <br>
--no-expert</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Allow the user to do certain
nonsensical or &quot;silly&quot; things like signing an
expired or revoked key, or certain potentially incompatible
things like generating unusual key types. This also disables
certain warning messages about potentially incompatible
actions. As the name implies, this option is for experts
only. If you don&rsquo;t fully understand the implications
of what it allows you to do, leave this off.
<b>--no-expert</b> disables this option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Sets up a named group, which is
similar to aliases in email programs. Any time the group
name is a recipient (<b>-r</b> or <b>--recipient</b>), it
will be expanded to the values specified. Multiple groups
with the same name are automatically merged into a single
group.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The values are

accepted. Note that a value with spaces in it will be
treated as two different values. Note also there is only one
level of expansion --- you cannot make an group that points
to another group. When used from the command line, it may be
necessary to quote the argument to this option to prevent
the shell from treating it as multiple arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--ungroup name</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Remove a given entry from the

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--try-secret-key</b>
<i>name</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">For hidden recipients GPG needs
to know the keys to use for trial decryption. The key set
with <b>--default-key</b> is always tried first, but this is
often not sufficient. This option allows to set more keys to
be used for trial decryption. Although any valid user-id
specification may be used for <i>name</i> it makes sense to
use at least the long keyid to avoid ambiguities. Note that
gpg-agent might pop up a pinentry for a lot keys to do the
trial decryption. If you want to stop all further trial
decryption you may use close-window button instead of the
cancel button.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--try-all-secrets</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Don&rsquo;t look at the key ID
as stored in the message but try all secret keys in turn to
find the right decryption key. This option forces the
behaviour as used by anonymous recipients (created by using
<b>--throw-keyids</b> or <b>--hidden-recipient</b>) and
might come handy in case where an encrypted message contains
a bogus key ID.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--skip-hidden-recipients
<br>
--no-skip-hidden-recipients</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">During decryption skip all
anonymous recipients. This option helps in the case that
people use the hidden recipients feature to hide there own
encrypt-to key from others. If oneself has many secret keys
this may lead to a major annoyance because all keys are
tried in turn to decrypt soemthing which was not really
intended for it. The drawback of this option is that it is
currently not possible to decrypt a message which includes
real anonymous recipients.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Write output to

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--max-output n</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This option sets a limit on the
number of bytes that will be generated when processing a
file. Since OpenPGP supports various levels of compression,
it is possible that the plaintext of a given message may be
significantly larger than the original OpenPGP message.
While GnuPG works properly with such messages, there is
often a desire to set a maximum file size that will be
generated before processing is forced to stop by the OS
limits. Defaults to 0, which means &quot;no limit&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--import-options
parameters</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This is a space or comma
delimited string that gives options for importing keys.
Options can be prepended with a &lsquo;no-&rsquo; to give
the opposite meaning. The options are: <b><br>
import-local-sigs</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Allow importing key signatures
marked as &quot;local&quot;. This is not generally useful
unless a shared keyring scheme is being used. Defaults to
no.</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>repair-pks-subkey-bug</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">During import, attempt to
repair the damage caused by the PKS keyserver bug (pre
version 0.9.6) that mangles keys with multiple subkeys. Note
that this cannot completely repair the damaged key as some
crucial data is removed by the keyserver, but it does at
least give you back one subkey. Defaults to no for regular
<b>--import</b> and to yes for keyserver
<b>--recv-keys</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>merge-only</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">During import, allow key
updates to existing keys, but do not allow any new keys to
be imported. Defaults to no.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>import-clean</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">After import, compact (remove
all signatures except the self-signature) any user IDs from
the new key that are not usable. Then, remove any signatures
from the new key that are not usable. This includes
signatures that were issued by keys that are not present on
the keyring. This option is the same as running the
<b>--edit-key</b> command &quot;clean&quot; after import.
Defaults to no.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>import-minimal</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Import the smallest key
possible. This removes all signatures except the most recent
self-signature on each user ID. This option is the same as
running the <b>--edit-key</b> command &quot;minimize&quot;
after import. Defaults to no.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--export-options
parameters</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This is a space or comma
delimited string that gives options for exporting keys.
Options can be prepended with a &lsquo;no-&rsquo; to give
the opposite meaning. The options are: <b><br>
export-local-sigs</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Allow exporting key signatures
marked as &quot;local&quot;. This is not generally useful
unless a shared keyring scheme is being used. Defaults to
no.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>export-attributes</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Include attribute user IDs
(photo IDs) while exporting. This is useful to export keys
if they are going to be used by an OpenPGP program that does
not accept attribute user IDs. Defaults to yes.</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>export-sensitive-revkeys</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Include designated revoker
information that was marked as &quot;sensitive&quot;.
Defaults to no.</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>export-reset-subkey-passwd</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">When using the
<b>--export-secret-subkeys</b> command, this option resets
the passphrases for all exported subkeys to empty. This is
useful when the exported subkey is to be used on an
unattended machine where a passphrase doesn&rsquo;t
necessarily make sense. Defaults to no.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>export-clean</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Compact (remove all signatures
from) user IDs on the key being exported if the user IDs are
not usable. Also, do not export any signatures that are not
usable. This includes signatures that were issued by keys
that are not present on the keyring. This option is the same
as running the <b>--edit-key</b> command &quot;clean&quot;
before export except that the local copy of the key is not
modified. Defaults to no.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>export-minimal</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Export the smallest key
possible. This removes all signatures except the most recent
self-signature on each user ID. This option is the same as
running the <b>--edit-key</b> command &quot;minimize&quot;
before export except that the local copy of the key is not
modified. Defaults to no.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--with-colons</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Print key listings delimited by
colons. Note that the output will be encoded in UTF-8
regardless of any <b>--display-charset</b> setting. This
format is useful when GnuPG is called from scripts and other
programs as it is easily machine parsed. The details of this
format are documented in the file
&lsquo;<i>doc/DETAILS</i>&rsquo;, which is included in the
GnuPG source distribution.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--fixed-list-mode</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Do not merge primary user ID
and primary key in <b>--with-colon</b> listing mode and
print all timestamps as seconds since 1970-01-01. Since
GnuPG 2.0.10, this mode is always used and thus this option
is obsolete; it does not harm to use it though.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--with-fingerprint</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Same as the command
<b>--fingerprint</b> but changes only the format of the
output and may be used together with another command.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--with-keygrip</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Include the keygrip in the key
listings.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>OpenPGP
protocol specific options. &nbsp; <br>
-t, --textmode <br>
--no-textmode</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Treat input files as text and
store them in the OpenPGP canonical text form with standard
&quot;CRLF&quot; line endings. This also sets the necessary
flags to inform the recipient that the encrypted or signed
data is text and may need its line endings converted back to
whatever the local system uses. This option is useful when
communicating between two platforms that have different line
ending conventions (UNIX-like to Mac, Mac to Windows, etc).
<b>--no-textmode</b> disables this option, and is the
default.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--force-v3-sigs <br>
--no-force-v3-sigs</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">OpenPGP states that an
implementation should generate v4 signatures but PGP
versions 5 through 7 only recognize v4 signatures on key
material. This option forces v3 signatures for signatures on
data. Note that this option implies
<b>--no-ask-sig-expire</b>, and unsets
<b>--sig-policy-url</b>, <b>--sig-notation</b>, and
<b>--sig-keyserver-url</b>, as these features cannot be used
with v3 signatures. <b>--no-force-v3-sigs</b> disables this
option. Defaults to no.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--force-v4-certs <br>
--no-force-v4-certs</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Always use v4 key signatures
even on v3 keys. This option also changes the default hash
algorithm for v3 RSA keys from MD5 to SHA-1.
<b>--no-force-v4-certs</b> disables this option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--force-mdc</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Force the use of encryption
with a modification detection code. This is always used with
the newer ciphers (those with a blocksize greater than 64
bits), or if all of the recipient keys indicate MDC support
in their feature flags.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--disable-mdc</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Disable the use of the
modification detection code. Note that by using this option,
the encrypted message becomes vulnerable to a message
modification attack.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--personal-cipher-preferences
string</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set the list of personal cipher
preferences to <b>string</b>. Use <b>gpg2 --version</b> to
get a list of available algorithms, and use <b>none</b> to
set no preference at all. This allows the user to safely
override the algorithm chosen by the recipient key
preferences, as GPG will only select an algorithm that is
usable by all recipients. The most highly ranked cipher in
this list is also used for the <b>--symmetric</b> encryption
command.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--personal-digest-preferences
string</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set the list of personal digest
preferences to <b>string</b>. Use <b>gpg2 --version</b> to
get a list of available algorithms, and use <b>none</b> to
set no preference at all. This allows the user to safely
override the algorithm chosen by the recipient key
preferences, as GPG will only select an algorithm that is
usable by all recipients. The most highly ranked digest
algorithm in this list is also used when signing without
encryption (e.g. <b>--clearsign</b> or <b>--sign</b>).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--personal-compress-preferences
string</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set the list of personal
compression preferences to <b>string</b>. Use <b>gpg2
--version</b> to get a list of available algorithms, and use
<b>none</b> to set no preference at all. This allows the
user to safely override the algorithm chosen by the
recipient key preferences, as GPG will only select an
algorithm that is usable by all recipients. The most highly
ranked compression algorithm in this list is also used when
there are no recipient keys to consider (e.g.
<b>--symmetric</b>).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--s2k-cipher-algo
name</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Use <b>name</b> as the cipher
algorithm used to protect secret keys. The default cipher is
CAST5. This cipher is also used for conventional encryption
if <b>--personal-cipher-preferences</b> and
<b>--cipher-algo</b> is not given.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--s2k-digest-algo
name</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Use <b>name</b> as the digest
algorithm used to mangle the passphrases. The default
algorithm is SHA-1.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--s2k-mode n</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Selects how passphrases are
mangled. If <b>n</b> is 0 a plain passphrase (which is not
recommended) will be used, a 1 adds a salt to the passphrase
and a 3 (the default) iterates the whole process a number of
times (see --s2k-count). Unless <b>--rfc1991</b> is used,
this mode is also used for conventional encryption.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--s2k-count n</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specify how many times the
passphrase mangling is repeated. This value may range
between 1024 and 65011712 inclusive. The default is inquired
from gpg-agent. Note that not all values in the
1024-65011712 range are legal and if an illegal value is
selected, GnuPG will round up to the nearest legal value.
This option is only meaningful if <b>--s2k-mode</b> is
3.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Compliance
options &nbsp;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These options
control what GnuPG is compliant to. Only one of these
options may be active at a time. Note that the default
setting of this is nearly always the correct one. See the
INTEROPERABILITY WITH OTHER OPENPGP PROGRAMS section below
before using one of these options. <b><br>
--gnupg</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Use standard GnuPG behavior.
This is essentially OpenPGP behavior (see <b>--openpgp</b>),
but with some additional workarounds for common
compatibility problems in different versions of PGP. This is
the default option, so it is not generally needed, but it
may be useful to override a different compliance option in
the gpg.conf file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--openpgp</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Reset all packet, cipher and
digest options to strict OpenPGP behavior. Use this option
to reset all previous options like <b>--s2k-*</b>,
<b>--cipher-algo</b>, <b>--digest-algo</b> and
<b>--compress-algo</b> to OpenPGP compliant values. All PGP
workarounds are disabled.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--rfc4880</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Reset all packet, cipher and

<i>epoch</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This option is only useful for
testing; it sets the system time back or forth to
<i>epoch</i> which is the number of seconds elapsed since
the year 1970. Alternatively <i>epoch</i> may be given as a

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--status-fd n</b></p>

except the logger data is written to file <b>file</b>. Note
that <b>--log-file</b> is only implemented for GnuPG-2.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--attribute-fd n</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Write attribute subpackets to
the file descriptor <b>n</b>. This is most useful for use
with <b>--status-fd</b>, since the status messages are
needed to separate out the various subpackets from the
stream delivered to the file descriptor.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--comment string <br>
--no-comments</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Use <b>string</b> as a comment
string in clear text signatures and ASCII armored messages
or keys (see <b>--armor</b>). The default behavior is not to
use a comment string. <b>--comment</b> may be repeated
multiple times to get multiple comment strings.
<b>--no-comments</b> removes all comments. It is a good idea
to keep the length of a single comment below 60 characters
to avoid problems with mail programs wrapping such lines.
Note that comment lines, like all other header lines, are
not protected by the signature.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--emit-version <br>
--no-emit-version</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Force inclusion of the version
string in ASCII armored output. <b>--no-emit-version</b>
disables this option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--sig-notation name=value
<br>
--cert-notation name=value <br>
-N, --set-notation name=value</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Put the name value pair into
the signature as notation data. <b>name</b> must consist
only of printable characters or spaces, and must contain a
&rsquo;@&rsquo; character in the form
keyname@domain.example.com (substituting the appropriate
keyname and domain name, of course). This is to help prevent
pollution of the IETF reserved notation namespace. The
<b>--expert</b> flag overrides the &rsquo;@&rsquo; check.
<b>value</b> may be any printable string; it will be encoded
in UTF8, so you should check that your
<b>--display-charset</b> is set correctly. If you prefix
<b>name</b> with an exclamation mark (!), the notation data
will be flagged as critical (rfc4880:5.2.3.16).
<b>--sig-notation</b> sets a notation for data signatures.
<b>--cert-notation</b> sets a notation for key signatures
(certifications). <b>--set-notation</b> sets both.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">There are
special codes that may be used in notation names.
&quot;%k&quot; will be expanded into the key ID of the key

making the signature, &quot;%S&quot; into the long key ID of
the key making the signature, &quot;%g&quot; into the
fingerprint of the key making the signature (which might be
a subkey), &quot;%p&quot; into the fingerprint of the
primary key of the key making the signature, &quot;%c&quot;
into the signature count from the OpenPGP smartcard, and
&quot;%%&quot; results in a single &quot;%&quot;. %k, %K,
and %f are only meaningful when making a key signature
(certification), and %c is only meaningful when using the
OpenPGP smartcard.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--sig-policy-url string <br>
--cert-policy-url string <br>
--set-policy-url string</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Use <b>string</b> as a Policy
URL for signatures (rfc4880:5.2.3.20). If you prefix it with
an exclamation mark (!), the policy URL packet will be
flagged as critical. <b>--sig-policy-url</b> sets a policy
url for data signatures. <b>--cert-policy-url</b> sets a
policy url for key signatures (certifications).
<b>--set-policy-url</b> sets both.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The same
%-expandos used for notation data are available here as
well.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--sig-keyserver-url
string</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Use <b>string</b> as a
preferred keyserver URL for data signatures. If you prefix

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The same
%-expandos used for notation data are available here as
well.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--set-filename
string</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Use <b>string</b> as the
filename which is stored inside messages. This overrides the
default, which is to use the actual filename of the file
being encrypted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--for-your-eyes-only <br>
--no-for-your-eyes-only</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set the &lsquo;for your eyes
only&rsquo; flag in the message. This causes GnuPG to refuse
to save the file unless the <b>--output</b> option is given,
and PGP to use a &quot;secure viewer&quot; with a claimed
Tempest-resistant font to display the message. This option
overrides <b>--set-filename</b>.
<b>--no-for-your-eyes-only</b> disables this option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--use-embedded-filename <br>
--no-use-embedded-filename</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Try to create a file with a
name as embedded in the data. This can be a dangerous option
as it allows to overwrite files. Defaults to no.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--cipher-algo name</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Use <b>name</b> as cipher
algorithm. Running the program with the command
<b>--version</b> yields a list of supported algorithms. If
this is not used the cipher algorithm is selected from the
preferences stored with the key. In general, you do not want
to use this option as it allows you to violate the OpenPGP
standard. <b>--personal-cipher-preferences</b> is the safe
way to accomplish the same thing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--digest-algo name</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Use <b>name</b> as the message
digest algorithm. Running the program with the command
<b>--version</b> yields a list of supported algorithms. In
general, you do not want to use this option as it allows you
to violate the OpenPGP standard.
<b>--personal-digest-preferences</b> is the safe way to
accomplish the same thing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--compress-algo name</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Use compression algorithm
<b>name</b>. &quot;zlib&quot; is RFC-1950 ZLIB compression.
&quot;zip&quot; is RFC-1951 ZIP compression which is used by
PGP. &quot;bzip2&quot; is a more modern compression scheme
that can compress some things better than zip or zlib, but
at the cost of more memory used during compression and
decompression. &quot;uncompressed&quot; or &quot;none&quot;
disables compression. If this option is not used, the
default behavior is to examine the recipient key preferences
to see which algorithms the recipient supports. If all else
fails, ZIP is used for maximum compatibility.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">ZLIB may give
better compression results than ZIP, as the compression
window size is not limited to 8k. BZIP2 may give even better
compression results than that, but will use a significantly
larger amount of memory while compressing and decompressing.
This may be significant in low memory situations. Note,
however, that PGP (all versions) only supports ZIP
compression. Using any algorithm other than ZIP or
&quot;none&quot; will make the message unreadable with PGP.
In general, you do not want to use this option as it allows
you to violate the OpenPGP standard.
<b>--personal-compress-preferences</b> is the safe way to
accomplish the same thing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--cert-digest-algo
name</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Use <b>name</b> as the message
digest algorithm used when signing a key. Running the
program with the command <b>--version</b> yields a list of
supported algorithms. Be aware that if you choose an
algorithm that GnuPG supports but other OpenPGP
implementations do not, then some users will not be able to
use the key signatures you make, or quite possibly your
entire key.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--disable-cipher-algo
name</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Never allow the use of
<b>name</b> as cipher algorithm. The given name will not be
checked so that a later loaded algorithm will still get
disabled.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--disable-pubkey-algo
name</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Never allow the use of
<b>name</b> as public key algorithm. The given name will not
be checked so that a later loaded algorithm will still get
disabled.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--throw-keyids <br>
--no-throw-keyids</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Do not put the recipient key
IDs into encrypted messages. This helps to hide the
receivers of the message and is a limited countermeasure
against traffic analysis. ([Using a little social
engineering anyone who is able to decrypt the message can
check whether one of the other recipients is the one he
suspects.]) On the receiving side, it may slow down the
decryption process because all available secret keys must be
tried. <b>--no-throw-keyids</b> disables this option. This
option is essentially the same as using
<b>--hidden-recipient</b> for all recipients.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--not-dash-escaped</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This option changes the
behavior of cleartext signatures so that they can be used
for patch files. You should not send such an armored file
via email because all spaces and line endings are hashed
too. You can not use this option for data which has 5 dashes
at the beginning of a line, patch files don&rsquo;t have
this. A special armor header line tells GnuPG about this
cleartext signature option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--escape-from-lines <br>
--no-escape-from-lines</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Because some mailers change
lines starting with &quot;From &quot; to &quot;&gt;From
&quot; it is good to handle such lines in a special way when
creating cleartext signatures to prevent the mail system
from breaking the signature. Note that all other PGP
versions do it this way too. Enabled by default.
<b>--no-escape-from-lines</b> disables this option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--passphrase-repeat
n</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specify how many times
<b>gpg2</b> will request a new passphrase be repeated. This
is useful for helping memorize a passphrase. Defaults to 1
repetition.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--passphrase-fd n</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Read the passphrase from file
descriptor <b>n</b>. Only the first line will be read from
file descriptor <b>n</b>. If you use 0 for <b>n</b>, the
passphrase will be read from STDIN. This can only be used if
only one passphrase is supplied. Note that this passphrase
is only used if the option <b>--batch</b> has also been
given. This is different from <b>gpg</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--passphrase-file
file</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Read the passphrase from file
<b>file</b>. Only the first line will be read from file
<b>file</b>. This can only be used if only one passphrase is
supplied. Obviously, a passphrase stored in a file is of
questionable security if other users can read this file.
Don&rsquo;t use this option if you can avoid it. Note that
this passphrase is only used if the option <b>--batch</b>
has also been given. This is different from <b>gpg</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--passphrase string</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Use <b>string</b> as the
passphrase. This can only be used if only one passphrase is
supplied. Obviously, this is of very questionable security
on a multi-user system. Don&rsquo;t use this option if you
can avoid it. Note that this passphrase is only used if the
option <b>--batch</b> has also been given. This is different
from <b>gpg</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--pinentry-mode mode</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set the pinentry mode to
<b>mode</b>. Allowed values for <b>mode</b> are: <b><br>
default</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Use the default of the agent,
which is <b>ask</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">Redirect Pinentry queries to

not prompted again if he enters a bad password.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--command-fd n</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This is a replacement for the
deprecated shared-memory IPC mode. If this option is
enabled, user input on questions is not expected from the
TTY but from the given file descriptor. It should be used
together with <b>--status-fd</b>. See the file doc/DETAILS
in the source distribution for details on how to use it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--command-file file</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Same as <b>--command-fd</b>,
except the commands are read out of file <b>file</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--allow-non-selfsigned-uid
<br>
--no-allow-non-selfsigned-uid</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Allow the import and use of
keys with user IDs which are not self-signed. This is not
recommended, as a non self-signed user ID is trivial to
forge. <b>--no-allow-non-selfsigned-uid</b> disables.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--allow-freeform-uid</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Disable all checks on the form
of the user ID while generating a new one. This option
should only be used in very special environments as it does
not ensure the de-facto standard format of user IDs.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--ignore-time-conflict</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">GnuPG normally checks that the
timestamps associated with keys and signatures have
plausible values. However, sometimes a signature seems to be
older than the key due to clock problems. This option makes
these checks just a warning. See also
<b>--ignore-valid-from</b> for timestamp issues on
subkeys.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--ignore-valid-from</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">GnuPG normally does not select
and use subkeys created in the future. This option allows
the use of such keys and thus exhibits the pre-1.0.7
behaviour. You should not use this option unless there is
some clock problem. See also <b>--ignore-time-conflict</b>
for timestamp issues with signatures.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--ignore-crc-error</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The ASCII armor used by OpenPGP
is protected by a CRC checksum against transmission errors.
Occasionally the CRC gets mangled somewhere on the
transmission channel but the actual content (which is
protected by the OpenPGP protocol anyway) is still okay.
This option allows GnuPG to ignore CRC errors.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--ignore-mdc-error</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This option changes a MDC
integrity protection failure into a warning. This can be
useful if a message is partially corrupt, but it is
necessary to get as much data as possible out of the corrupt
message. However, be aware that a MDC protection failure may
also mean that the message was tampered with intentionally
by an attacker.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--no-default-keyring</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Do not add the default keyrings
to the list of keyrings. Note that GnuPG will not operate
without any keyrings, so if you use this option and do not
provide alternate keyrings via <b>--keyring</b> or
<b>--secret-keyring</b>, then GnuPG will still use the
default public or secret keyrings.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--skip-verify</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Skip the signature verification
step. This may be used to make the decryption faster if the
signature verification is not needed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--with-key-data</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Print key listings delimited by
colons (like <b>--with-colons</b>) and print the public key
data.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--fast-list-mode</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Changes the output of the list
commands to work faster; this is achieved by leaving some
parts empty. Some applications don&rsquo;t need the user ID
and the trust information given in the listings. By using
this options they can get a faster listing. The exact
behaviour of this option may change in future versions. If
you are missing some information, don&rsquo;t use this
option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--no-literal</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--show-session-key</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Display the session key used
for one message. See <b>--override-session-key</b> for the
counterpart of this option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">We think that
Key Escrow is a Bad Thing; however the user should have the
freedom to decide whether to go to prison or to reveal the
content of one specific message without compromising all
messages ever encrypted for one secret key. DON&rsquo;T USE
IT UNLESS YOU ARE REALLY FORCED TO DO SO.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--override-session-key
string</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Don&rsquo;t use the public key
but the session key <b>string</b>. The format of this string
is the same as the one printed by <b>--show-session-key</b>.
This option is normally not used but comes handy in case
someone forces you to reveal the content of an encrypted

out the secret key.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--ask-sig-expire <br>
--no-ask-sig-expire</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">When making a data signature,
prompt for an expiration time. If this option is not
specified, the expiration time set via

<b>--no-ask-sig-expire</b> disables this option.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--default-sig-expire</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The default expiration time to
use for signature expiration. Valid values are &quot;0&quot;
for no expiration, a number followed by the letter d (for
days), w (for weeks), m (for months), or y (for years) (for
example &quot;2m&quot; for two months, or &quot;5y&quot; for

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--default-cert-expire</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The default expiration time to
use for key signature expiration. Valid values are
&quot;0&quot; for no expiration, a number followed by the
letter d (for days), w (for weeks), m (for months), or y
(for years) (for example &quot;2m&quot; for two months, or

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--allow-multiple-messages
<br>
--no-allow-multiple-messages</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Allow processing of multiple
OpenPGP messages contained in a single file or stream. Some
programs that call GPG are not prepared to deal with
multiple messages being processed together, so this option
defaults to no. Note that versions of GPG prior to 1.4.7
always allowed multiple messages.</p>

use this option unless you need it as a temporary
workaround!</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--enable-special-filenames</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This options enables a mode in
which filenames of the form &lsquo;<i>-&amp;n</i>&rsquo;,
where n is a non-negative decimal number, refer to the file
descriptor n and not to a file with that name.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--no-expensive-trust-checks</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Experimental use only.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--preserve-permissions</b></p>

in the edit menu.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--default-keyserver-url
name</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set the default keyserver URL
to <b>name</b>. This keyserver will be used as the keyserver
URL when writing a new self-signature on a key, which
includes key generation and changing preferences.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--list-config</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Display various internal
configuration parameters of GnuPG. This option is intended
for external programs that call GnuPG to perform tasks, and
is thus not generally useful. See the file
&lsquo;<i>doc/DETAILS</i>&rsquo; in the source distribution
for the details of which configuration items may be listed.
<b>--list-config</b> is only usable with
<b>--with-colons</b> set.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--gpgconf-list</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This command is similar to
<b>--list-config</b> but in general only internally used by
the <b>gpgconf</b> tool.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--gpgconf-test</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This is more or less dummy
action. However it parses the configuration file and returns
with failure if the configuration file would prevent
<b>gpg</b> from startup. Thus it may be used to run a syntax
check on the configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Deprecated

<h2>HOW TO SPECIFY A USER ID
<a name="HOW TO SPECIFY A USER ID"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There are
different ways to specify a user ID to GnuPG. Some of them
are only valid for <b>gpg</b> others are only good for
<b>gpgsm</b>. Here is the entire list of ways to specify a
key: <b><br>
By key Id.</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This format is deduced from the
length of the string and its content or <b>0x</b> prefix.
The key Id of an X.509 certificate are the low 64 bits of
its SHA-1 fingerprint. The use of key Ids is just a
shortcut, for all automated processing the fingerprint
should be used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">When using
<b>gpg</b> an exclamation mark (!) may be appended to force
using the specified primary or secondary key and not to try
and calculate which primary or secondary key to use.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The last four
lines of the example give the key ID in their long form as
internally used by the OpenPGP protocol. You can see the
long key ID using the option <b>--with-colons</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">234567C4 <br>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>By fingerprint.</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This format is deduced from the
length of the string and its content or the <b>0x</b>

available with <b>gpgsm</b> (i.e. the SHA-1 hash of the
certificate).</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">When using

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Please note
that we have reused the hash mark identifier which was used

is not anymore used and there should be no conflict when
used with X.509 stuff.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Using the
RFC-2253 format of DNs has the drawback that it is not
possible to map them back to the original encoding, however
we don&rsquo;t have to do this because our key database
stores this encoding as meta data.</p>

<h2>BUGS
<a name="BUGS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On older
systems this program should be installed as setuid(root).
This is necessary to lock memory pages. Locking memory pages
prevents the operating system from writing memory pages
(which may contain passphrases or other sensitive material)
to disk. If you get no warning message about insecure memory
your operating system supports locking without being root.
The program drops root privileges as soon as locked memory
is allocated.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note also that
some systems (especially laptops) have the ability to
&lsquo;&lsquo;suspend to disk&rsquo;&rsquo; (also known as
&lsquo;&lsquo;safe sleep&rsquo;&rsquo; or
&lsquo;&lsquo;hibernate&rsquo;&rsquo;). This writes all
memory to disk before going into a low power or even powered
off mode. Unless measures are taken in the operating system
to protect the saved memory, passphrases or other sensitive
material may be recoverable from it later.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Before you
report a bug you should first search the mailing list
archives for similar problems and second check whether such
a bug has already been reported to our bug tracker at
