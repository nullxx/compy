calls.</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The system call
is the fundamental interface between an application and the
Linux kernel.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>System calls
and library wrapper functions</b> <br>
System calls are generally not invoked directly, but rather
via wrapper functions in glibc (or perhaps some other
library). For details of direct invocation of a system call,
see <b>intro</b>(2). Often, but not always, the name of the
wrapper function is the same as the name of the system call
that it invokes. For example, glibc contains a function
<b>truncate</b>() which invokes the underlying
&quot;truncate&quot; system call.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Often the glibc
wrapper function is quite thin, doing little work other than
copying arguments to the right registers before invoking the
system call, and then setting <i>errno</i> appropriately
after the system call has returned. (These are the same
steps that are performed by <b>syscall</b>(2), which can be
used to invoke system calls for which no wrapper function is
provided.) Note: system calls indicate a failure by
returning a negative error number to the caller; when this
happens, the wrapper function negates the returned error
number (to make it positive), copies it to <i>errno</i>, and
returns &minus;1 to the caller of the wrapper.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Sometimes,
however, the wrapper function does some extra work before
invoking the system call. For example, nowadays there are
(for reasons described below) two related system calls,
<b>truncate</b>(2) and <b>truncate64</b>(2), and the glibc
<b>truncate</b>() wrapper function checks which of those
system calls are provided by the kernel and determines which
should be employed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>System call
list</b> <br>
Below is a list of the Linux system calls. In the list, the
<i>Kernel</i> column indicates the kernel version for those
system calls that were new in Linux 2.2, or have appeared
since that kernel version. Note the following points:</p>

<p>Where a system call is marked &quot;1.2&quot; this means
the system call probably appeared in a 1.1.x kernel version,
and first appeared in a stable kernel with 1.2. (Development
of the 1.2 kernel was initiated from a branch of kernel
1.0.6 via the 1.1.x unstable kernel series.)</p></td></tr>

the system call probably appeared in a 1.3.x kernel version,
and first appeared in a stable kernel with 2.0. (Development
of the 2.0 kernel was initiated from a branch of kernel
1.2.x, somewhere around 1.2.10, via the 1.3.x unstable
kernel series.)</p></td></tr>

of kernel 2.0.21 via the 2.1.x unstable kernel series.)</p></td></tr>

<p>Where a system call is marked &quot;2.4&quot; this means
the system call probably appeared in a 2.3.x kernel version,

of kernel 2.2.8 via the 2.3.x unstable kernel series.)</p></td></tr>

<p>Where a system call is marked &quot;2.6&quot; this means
the system call probably appeared in a 2.5.x kernel version,
and first appeared in a stable kernel with 2.6.0.
(Development of kernel 2.6 was initiated from a branch of
kernel 2.4.15 via the 2.5.x unstable kernel series.)</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">

<td width="1%">


<p>*</p></td>
<td width="3%"></td>
<td width="85%">


<p>Starting with kernel 2.6.0, the development model
changed, and new system calls may appear in each 2.6.x
release. In this case, the exact version number where the
system call appeared is shown. This convention continues
with the 3.x kernel series, which followed on from kernel
2.6.39.</p> </td></tr>

<td width="3%"></td>
<td width="85%">


<p>In some cases, a system call was added to a stable
kernel series after it branched from the previous stable
kernel series, and then backported into the earlier stable
kernel series. For example some system calls that appeared
in 2.6.x were also backported into a 2.4.x release after
2.4.15. When this is so, the version where the system call
appeared in both of the major kernel series is listed.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The list of
system calls that are available as at kernel 3.9 (or in a
few cases only on older kernels) is as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On many
platforms, including x86-32, socket calls are all
multiplexed (via glibc wrapper functions) through
<b>socketcall</b>(2) and similarly System V IPC calls are
multiplexed through <b>ipc</b>(2).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Although slots
are reserved for them in the system call table, the
following system calls are not implemented in the standard
kernel: <b>afs_syscall</b>(2), <b>break</b>(2),
<b>ftime</b>(2), <b>getpmsg</b>(2), <b>gtty</b>(2),
<b>idle</b>(2), <b>lock</b>(2), <b>madvise1</b>(2),
<b>mpx</b>(2), <b>phys</b>(2), <b>prof</b>(2),
<b>profil</b>(2), <b>putpmsg</b>(2), <b>security</b>(2),
<b>stty</b>(2), <b>tuxcall</b>(2), <b>ulimit</b>(2), and
<b>vserver</b>(2) (see also <b>unimplemented</b>(2)).
However, <b>ftime</b>(3), <b>profil</b>(3) and
<b>ulimit</b>(3) exist as library routines. The slot for
<b>phys</b>(2) is in use since kernel 2.1.116 for
<b>umount</b>(2); <b>phys</b>(2) will never be implemented.
The <b>getpmsg</b>(2) and <b>putpmsg</b>(2) calls are for
kernels patched to support STREAMS, and may never be in the
standard kernel.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There was
briefly <b>set_zone_reclaim</b>(2), added in Linux 2.6.13,
and removed in 2.6.16; this system call was never available
to user space.</p>

<h2>NOTES
<a name="NOTES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Roughly
speaking, the code belonging to the system call with number
__NR_xxx defined in <i>/usr/include/asm/unistd.h</i> can be
found in the Linux kernel source in the routine
<i>sys_xxx</i>(). (The dispatch table for i386 can be found
in <i>/usr/src/linux/arch/i386/kernel/entry.S</i>.) There
are many exceptions, however, mostly because older system
calls were superseded by newer ones, and this has been
treated somewhat unsystematically. On platforms with
proprietary operating-system emulation, such as parisc,
sparc, sparc64 and alpha, there are many additional system
calls; mips64 also contains a full set of 32-bit system
calls.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Over time,
changes to the interfaces of some system calls have been
necessary. One reason for such changes was the need to
increase the size of structures or scalar values passed to
the system call. Because of these changes, there are now
various groups of related system calls (e.g.,
<b>truncate</b>(2) and <b>truncate64</b>(2)) which perform
similar tasks, but which vary in details such as the size of
their arguments. (As noted earlier, applications are
generally unaware of this: the glibc wrapper functions do
some work to ensure that the right system call is invoked,
and that ABI compatibility is preserved for old binaries.)
Examples of systems calls that exist in multiple versions
are the following:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">*</p></td>
<td width="3%"></td>
<td width="85%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">By now there are three different
versions of <b>stat</b>(2): <i>sys_stat</i>() (slot
<i>__NR_oldstat</i>), <i>sys_newstat</i>() (slot
<i>__NR_stat</i>), and <i>sys_stat64</i>() (slot
<i>__NR_stat64</i>), with the last being the most current. A
similar story applies for <b>lstat</b>(2) and
<b>fstat</b>(2).</p> </td></tr>

<p>In Linux 2.0, a new version of <b>vm86</b>(2) appeared,
with the old and the new kernel routines being named
<i>sys_vm86old</i>() and <i>sys_vm86</i>().</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>*</p></td>
<td width="3%"></td>
<td width="85%">


<p>In Linux 2.4, a new version of <b>getrlimit</b>(2)
appeared, with the old and the new kernel routines being
named <i>sys_old_getrlimit</i>() (slot
<i>__NR_getrlimit</i>) and <i>sys_getrlimit</i>() (slot
<i>__NR_ugetrlimit</i>).</p> </td></tr>

<p>Linux 2.4 increased the size of user and group IDs from
16 to 32 bits. To support this change, a range of system
calls were added (e.g., <b>chown32</b>(2),
<b>getuid32</b>(2), <b>getgroups32</b>(2),
<b>setresuid32</b>(2)), superseding earlier calls of the
same name without the &quot;32&quot; suffix.</p></td></tr>

<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>*</p></td>
<td width="3%"></td>
<td width="85%">


<p>Linux 2.4 added support for applications on 32-bit
architectures to access large files (i.e., files for which
the sizes and file offsets can&rsquo;t be represented in 32
bits.) To support this change, replacements were required
for system calls that deal with file offsets and sizes. Thus
the following system calls were added: <b>fcntl64</b>(2),
<b>ftruncate64</b>(2), <b>getdents64</b>(2),
<b>stat64</b>(2), <b>statfs64</b>(2), and their analogs that
work with file descriptors or symbolic links. These system
calls supersede the older system calls which, except in the
case of the &quot;stat&quot; calls, have the same name
without the &quot;64&quot; suffix.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:15%; margin-top: 1em">On newer
platforms that only have 64-bit file access and 32-bit uids
(e.g., alpha, ia64, s390x) there are no *64 or *32 calls.
Where the *64 and *32 calls exist, the other versions are
obsolete.</p>

<td width="85%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">The <i>rt_sig*</i> calls were
added in kernel 2.2 to support the addition of real-time
signals (see <b>signal</b>(7)). These system calls supersede
the older system calls of the same name without the
&quot;rt_&quot; prefix.</p></td></tr>

<p>The <b>select</b>(2) and <b>mmap</b>(2) system calls use
five or more arguments, which caused problems in the way
argument passing on the i386 used to be set up. Thus, while
other architectures have <i>sys_select</i>() and
<i>sys_mmap</i>() corresponding to <i>__NR_select</i> and
<i>__NR_mmap</i>, on i386 one finds <i>old_select</i>() and
<i>old_mmap</i>() (routines that use a pointer to a argument
block) instead. These days passing five arguments is not a
problem any more, and there is a <i>__NR__newselect</i> that
corresponds directly to <i>sys_select</i>() and similarly
<i>__NR_mmap2</i>.</p> </td></tr>
