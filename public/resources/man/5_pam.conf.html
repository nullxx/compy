&minus; PAM configuration files</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When a
<i>PAM</i> aware privilege granting application is started,
it activates its attachment to the PAM&minus;API. This
activation performs a number of tasks, the most important
being the reading of the configuration file(s):
/etc/pam.conf. Alternatively, this may be the contents of
the /etc/pam.d/ directory. The presence of this directory
will cause Linux&minus;PAM to ignore /etc/pam.conf.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These files
list the <i>PAM</i>s that will do the authentication tasks
required by this service, and the appropriate behavior of
the PAM&minus;API in the event that individual <i>PAM</i>s
fail.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The syntax of
the /etc/pam.conf configuration file is as follows. The file
is made up of a list of rules, each rule is typically placed
on a single line, but may be extended with an escaped end of
line: &lsquo;\&lt;LF&gt;'. Comments are preceded with
&lsquo;#' marks and extend to the next end of line.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The format of
each rule is a space separated collection of tokens, the
first three being case&minus;insensitive:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>service type
control module&minus;path module&minus;arguments</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The syntax of
files contained in the /etc/pam.d/ directory, are identical
except for the absence of any <i>service</i> field. In this
case, the <i>service</i> is the name of the file in the
/etc/pam.d/ directory. This filename must be in lower
case.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">An important
feature of <i>PAM</i>, is that a number of rules may be
<i>stacked</i> to combine the services of a number of PAMs
for a given authentication task.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>service</i> is typically the familiar name of the
corresponding application: <i>login</i> and <i>su</i> are
good examples. The <i>service</i>&minus;name, <i>other</i>,
is reserved for giving <i>default</i> rules. Only lines that
mention the current service (or in the absence of such, the
<i>other</i> entries) will be associated with the given
service&minus;application.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The <i>type</i>
is the management group that the rule corresponds to. It is
used to specify which of the management groups the
subsequent module is to be associated with. Valid entries
are:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">account</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">this module type performs
non&minus;authentication based account management. It is
typically used to restrict/permit access to a service based
on the time of day, currently available system resources
(maximum number of users) or perhaps the location of the
applicant user &minus;&minus; 'root' login only on the
console.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">auth</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">this module type provides two
aspects of authenticating the user. Firstly, it establishes
that the user is who they claim to be, by instructing the
application to prompt the user for a password or other means
of identification. Secondly, the module can grant group
membership or other privileges through its credential
granting properties.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">password</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">this module type is required
for updating the authentication token associated with the
user. Typically, there is one module for each
'challenge/response' based authentication (auth) type.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">session</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">this module type is associated
with doing things that need to be done for the user
before/after they can be given service. Such things include
the logging of information concerning the opening/closing of
some data exchange with a user, mounting directories,
etc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the
<i>type</i> value from the list above is prepended with a
<i>&minus;</i> character the PAM library will not log to the
system log if it is not possible to load the module because
it is missing in the system. This can be useful especially
for modules which are not always installed on the system and
are not required for correct authentication and
authorization of the login session.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The third
field, <i>control</i>, indicates the behavior of the
PAM&minus;API should the module fail to succeed in its
authentication task. There are two types of syntax for this
control field: the simple one has a single simple keyword;
the more complicated one involves a square&minus;bracketed
selection of <i>value=action</i> pairs.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For the simple
(historical) syntax valid <i>control</i> values are:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">required</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">failure of such a PAM will
ultimately lead to the PAM&minus;API returning failure but
only after the remaining <i>stacked</i> modules (for this
<i>service</i> and <i>type</i>) have been invoked.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">requisite</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">like <i>required</i>, however,
in the case that such a module returns a failure, control is
directly returned to the application or to the superior PAM
stack. The return value is that associated with the first
required or requisite module to fail. Note, this flag can be
used to protect against the possibility of a user getting
the opportunity to enter a password over an unsafe medium.
It is conceivable that such behavior might inform an
attacker of valid accounts on a system. This possibility
should be weighed against the not insignificant concerns of
exposing a sensitive password in a hostile environment.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">sufficient</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">if such a module succeeds and
no prior <i>required</i> module has failed the PAM framework
returns success to the application or to the superior PAM
stack immediately without calling any further modules in the
stack. A failure of a <i>sufficient</i> module is ignored
and processing of the PAM module stack continues
unaffected.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">optional</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">the success or failure of this
module is only important if it is the only module in the
stack associated with this <i>service</i>+<i>type</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">include</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">include all lines of given type
from the configuration file specified as an argument to this
control.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">substack</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">include all lines of given type
from the configuration file specified as an argument to this
control. This differs from <i>include</i> in that evaluation
of the <i>done</i> and <i>die</i> actions in a substack does
not cause skipping the rest of the complete module stack,
but only of the substack. Jumps in a substack also can not
make evaluation jump out of it, and the whole substack is
counted as one module when the jump is done in a parent
stack. The <i>reset</i> action will reset the state of a
module stack to the state it was in as of beginning of the
substack evaluation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For the more
complicated syntax valid <i>control</i> values have the
following form:</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">[value1=action1
value2=action2 ...]</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Where
<i>valueN</i> corresponds to the return code from the
function invoked in the module for which the line is
defined. It is selected from one of these: <i>success</i>,
<i>open_err</i>, <i>symbol_err</i>, <i>service_err</i>,
<i>system_err</i>, <i>buf_err</i>, <i>perm_denied</i>,
<i>auth_err</i>, <i>cred_insufficient</i>,
<i>authinfo_unavail</i>, <i>user_unknown</i>,
<i>maxtries</i>, <i>new_authtok_reqd</i>,
<i>acct_expired</i>, <i>session_err</i>,
<i>cred_unavail</i>, <i>cred_expired</i>, <i>cred_err</i>,
<i>no_module_data</i>, <i>conv_err</i>, <i>authtok_err</i>,
<i>authtok_recover_err</i>, <i>authtok_lock_busy</i>,
<i>authtok_disable_aging</i>, <i>try_again</i>,
<i>ignore</i>, <i>abort</i>, <i>authtok_expired</i>,
<i>module_unknown</i>, <i>bad_item</i>, <i>conv_again</i>,
<i>incomplete</i>, and <i>default</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The last of
these, <i>default</i>, implies 'all <i>valueN</i>'s not
mentioned explicitly. Note, the full list of PAM errors is
available in /usr/include/security/_pam_types.h. The
<i>actionN</i> can take one of the following forms:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">ignore</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">when used with a stack of
modules, the module's return status will not contribute to
the return code the application obtains.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">bad</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">this action indicates that the
return code should be thought of as indicative of the module
failing. If this module is the first in the stack to fail,
its status value will be used for that of the whole
stack.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">die</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">equivalent to bad with the side
effect of terminating the module stack and PAM immediately
returning to the application.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">ok</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">this tells PAM that the
administrator thinks this return code should contribute
directly to the return code of the full stack of modules. In
other words, if the former state of the stack would lead to
a return of <i>PAM_SUCCESS</i>, the module's return code
will override this value. Note, if the former state of the
stack holds some value that is indicative of a modules
failure, this 'ok' value will not be used to override that
value.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">done</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">equivalent to ok with the side
effect of terminating the module stack and PAM immediately
returning to the application.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">N (an unsigned
integer)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">equivalent to ok with the side
effect of jumping over the next N modules in the stack. Note
that N equal to 0 is not allowed (and it would be identical
to ok in such case).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">reset</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">clear all memory of the state
of the module stack and start again with the next stacked
module.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Each of the
four keywords: required; requisite; sufficient; and
optional, have an equivalent expression in terms of the
[...] syntax. They are as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">required</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">[success=ok new_authtok_reqd=ok
ignore=ignore default=bad]</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">requisite</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">[success=ok new_authtok_reqd=ok
ignore=ignore default=die]</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">sufficient</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">[success=done
new_authtok_reqd=done default=ignore]</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">optional</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">[success=ok new_authtok_reqd=ok
default=ignore]</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>module&minus;path</i>
is either the full filename of the PAM to be used by the
application (it begins with a '/'), or a relative pathname
from the default module location: /lib/security/ or
/lib64/security/, depending on the architecture.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>module&minus;arguments</i>
are a space separated list of tokens that can be used to
modify the specific behavior of the given PAM. Such
arguments will be documented for each individual module.
Note, if you wish to include spaces in an argument, you
should surround that argument with square brackets.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">squid auth
required pam_mysql.so user=passwd_query passwd=mada \ <br>
db=eminence [query=select user_name from internet_service \
<br>
where user_name='%u' and password=PASSWORD('%p') and \ <br>
service='web_proxy']</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When using this
convention, you can include &lsquo;[' characters inside the
string, and if you wish to include a &lsquo;]' character
inside the string that will survive the argument parsing,
you should use &lsquo;\]'. In other words:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">[..[..\]..]
&minus;&minus;&gt; ..[..]..</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Any line in
(one of) the configuration file(s), that is not formatted
correctly, will generally tend (erring on the side of
caution) to make the authentication process fail. A
corresponding error is written to the system log files with
a call to <b>syslog</b>(3).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">More flexible
than the single configuration file is it to configure libpam
via the contents of the /etc/pam.d/ directory. In this case
the directory is filled with files each of which has a
filename equal to a service&minus;name (in
lower&minus;case): it is the personal configuration file for
the named service.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The syntax of
each file in /etc/pam.d/ is similar to that of the
/etc/pam.conf file and is made up of lines of the following
form:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">type control
module&minus;path module&minus;arguments</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The only
difference being that the service&minus;name is not present.
The service&minus;name is of course the name of the given
configuration file. For example, /etc/pam.d/login contains
the configuration for the <b>login</b> service.</p>
