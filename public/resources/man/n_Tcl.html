</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
rules define the syntax and semantics of the Tcl language:
<br>
[1] <b>Commands.</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">A Tcl script is a string
containing one or more commands. Semi-colons and newlines
are command separators unless quoted as described below.
Close brackets are command terminators during command
substitution (see below) unless quoted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">[2] <b>Evaluation.</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">A command is evaluated in two
steps. First, the Tcl interpreter breaks the command into
<i>words</i> and performs substitutions as described below.
These substitutions are performed in the same way for all
commands. The first word is used to locate a command
procedure to carry out the command, then all of the words of
the command are passed to the command procedure. The command
procedure is free to interpret each of its words in any way
it likes, such as an integer, variable name, list, or Tcl
script. Different commands interpret their words
differently.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">[3] <b>Words.</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Words of a command are
separated by white space (except for newlines, which are
command separators).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">[4] <b>Double quotes.</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If the first character of a
word is double-quote (&ldquo;&quot;&rdquo;) then the word is
terminated by the next double-quote character. If
semi-colons, close brackets, or white space characters
(including newlines) appear between the quotes then they are
treated as ordinary characters and included in the word.
Command substitution, variable substitution, and backslash
substitution are performed on the characters between the
quotes as described below. The double-quotes are not
retained as part of the word.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">[5] <b>Argument expansion.</b>
<big>&#9474;</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If a word starts with the
string &ldquo;{*}&rdquo; followed by a <big>&#9474;</big>
non-whitespace character, then the leading &ldquo;{*}&rdquo;
is removed and <big>&#9474;</big> the rest of the word is
parsed and substituted as any other <big>&#9474;</big> word.
After substitution, the word is parsed as a list (without
<big>&#9474;</big> command or variable substitutions;
backslash substitutions are <big>&#9474;</big> performed as
is normal for a list and individual internal words
<big>&#9474;</big> may be surrounded by either braces or
double-quote characters), <big>&#9474;</big> and its words
are added to the command being substituted. For
<big>&#9474;</big> instance, &ldquo;cmd a {*}{b [c]} d
{*}{$e f &quot;g h&quot;}&rdquo; is equivalent to
<big>&#9474;</big> &ldquo;cmd a b {[c]} d {$e} f &quot;g
h&quot;&rdquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">[6] <b>Braces.</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If the first character of a
word is an open brace (&ldquo;{&rdquo;) and rule [5] does
not apply, then the word is terminated by the matching close
brace (&ldquo;}&rdquo;). Braces nest within the word: for
each additional open brace there must be an additional close
brace (however, if an open brace or close brace within the
word is quoted with a backslash then it is not counted in
locating the matching close brace). No substitutions are
performed on the characters between the braces except for
backslash-newline substitutions described below, nor do
semi-colons, newlines, close brackets, or white space
receive any special interpretation. The word will consist of
exactly the characters between the outer braces, not
including the braces themselves.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">[7] <b>Command
substitution.</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If a word contains an open
bracket (&ldquo;[&rdquo;) then Tcl performs <i>command
substitution</i>. To do this it invokes the Tcl interpreter
recursively to process the characters following the open
bracket as a Tcl script. The script may contain any number
of commands and must be terminated by a close bracket
(&ldquo;]&rdquo;). The result of the script (i.e. the result
of its last command) is substituted into the word in place
of the brackets and all of the characters between them.
There may be any number of command substitutions in a single
word. Command substitution is not performed on words
enclosed in braces.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">[8] <b>Variable
substitution.</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If a word contains a
dollar-sign (&ldquo;$&rdquo;) followed by one of the forms
described below, then Tcl performs <i>variable
substitution</i>: the dollar-sign and the following
characters are replaced in the word by the value of a
variable. Variable substitution may take any of the
following forms:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

<td width="18%">


<p><b>$</b><i>name</i></p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="55%">


<p><i>Name</i> is the name of a scalar variable; the name
is a sequence of one or more characters that are a letter,
digit, underscore, or namespace separators (two or more
colons).</p> </td></tr>

<td width="22%"></td>
<td width="18%">


<p><b>$</b><i>name</i><b>(</b><i>index</i><b>)</b></p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="55%">


<p><i>Name</i> gives the name of an array variable and
<i>index</i> gives the name of an element within that array.
<i>Name</i> must contain only letters, digits, underscores,
and namespace separators, and may be an empty string.
Command substitutions, variable substitutions, and backslash
substitutions are performed on the characters of
<i>index</i>.</p> </td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="22%"></td>
<td width="18%">


<p><b>${</b><i>name</i><b>}</b></p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>

<p><i>Name</i> is the name of a scalar variable. It may
contain any characters whatsoever except for close
braces.</p> </td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">There may be
any number of variable substitutions in a single word.
Variable substitution is not performed on words enclosed in
braces.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">[9] <b>Backslash
substitution.</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If a backslash
(&ldquo;\&rdquo;) appears within a word then <i>backslash
substitution</i> occurs. In all cases but those described
below the backslash is dropped and the following character
is treated as an ordinary character and included in the
word. This allows characters such as double quotes, close
brackets, and dollar signs to be included in words without
triggering special processing. The following table lists the
backslash sequences that are handled specially, along with
the value that replaces each sequence.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">\<b>&lt;newline&gt;</b><i>whiteSpace</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">A single space character
replaces the backslash, newline, and all spaces and tabs
after the newline. This backslash sequence is unique in that
it is replaced in a separate pre-pass before the command is
actually parsed. This means that it will be replaced even
when it occurs between braces, and the resulting space will
be treated as a word separator if it is not in braces or
quotes.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

<tr valign="top" align="left">

<td width="9%">


<p>\<i>ooo</i></p></td>
<td width="1%"></td>
<td width="68%">


<p>The digits <i>ooo</i> (one, two, or three of them) give
an eight-bit octal value for the Unicode character that will
be inserted. The upper bits of the Unicode character will be
0.</p> </td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="22%"></td>
<td width="9%">


<p>\<b>x</b><i>hh</i></p></td>
<td width="1%"></td>
<td width="68%">


<p>The hexadecimal digits <i>hh</i> give an eight-bit
hexadecimal value for the Unicode character that will be
inserted. Any number of hexadecimal digits may be present;
however, all but the last two are ignored (the result is
always a one-byte quantity). The upper bits of the Unicode
character will be 0.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="22%"></td>
<td width="9%">


<p>\<b>u</b><i>hhhh</i></p></td>
<td width="1%"></td>
<td width="68%">


<p>The hexadecimal digits <i>hhhh</i> (one, two, three, or
four of them) give a sixteen-bit hexadecimal value for the
Unicode character that will be inserted.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Backslash
substitution is not performed on words enclosed in braces,
except for backslash-newline as described above.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">[10] <b>Comments.</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If a hash character
(&ldquo;#&rdquo;) appears at a point where Tcl is expecting
the first character of the first word of a command, then the
hash character and the characters that follow it, up through
the next newline, are treated as a comment and ignored. The
comment character only has significance when it appears at
the beginning of a command.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">[11] <b>Order of
substitution.</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Each character is processed
exactly once by the Tcl interpreter as part of creating the
words of a command. For example, if variable substitution
occurs then no further substitutions are performed on the
value of the variable; the value is inserted into the word
verbatim. If command substitution occurs then the nested
command is processed entirely by the recursive call to the
Tcl interpreter; no substitutions are performed before
making the recursive call and no additional substitutions
are performed on the result of the nested script.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Substitutions
take place from left to right, and each substitution is
evaluated completely before attempting to evaluate the next.
Thus, a sequence like</p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;">set y [set x 0][incr x][incr
x]</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">will always set the variable
<i>y</i> to the value, <i>012</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">[12] <b>Substitution and word
boundaries.</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Substitutions do not affect the
word boundaries of a command, except for argument expansion
as specified in rule [5]. For example, during variable
substitution the entire value of the variable becomes part
of a single word, even if the variable&rsquo;s value
contains spaces.</p>
