Writing and packaging system daemons</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A daemon is a
service process that runs in the background and supervises
the system or provides functionality to other processes.
Traditionally, daemons are implemented following a scheme
originating in SysV Unix. Modern daemons should follow a
simpler yet more powerful scheme (here called
&quot;new&minus;style&quot; daemons), as implemented by
<b>systemd</b>(1). This manual page covers both schemes, and
in particular includes recommendations for daemons that
shall be included in the systemd init system.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>SysV
Daemons</b> <br>
When a traditional SysV daemon starts, it should execute the
following steps as part of the initialization. Note that
these steps are unnecessary for new&minus;style daemons (see
below), and should only be implemented if compatibility with
SysV is essential.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">1. Close all
open file descriptors except standard input, output, and
error (i.e. the first three file descriptors 0, 1, 2). This
ensures that no accidentally passed file descriptor stays
around in the daemon process. On Linux, this is best
implemented by iterating through /proc/self/fd, with a
fallback of iterating from file descriptor 3 to the value
returned by <b>getrlimit()</b> for <b>RLIMIT_NOFILE</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">2. Reset all
signal handlers to their default. This is best done by
iterating through the available signals up to the limit of
<b>_NSIG</b> and resetting them to <b>SIG_DFL</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">3. Reset the
signal mask using <b>sigprocmask()</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">4. Sanitize the
environment block, removing or resetting environment
variables that might negatively impact daemon runtime.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">5. Call
<b>fork()</b>, to create a background process.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">6. In the
child, call <b>setsid()</b> to detach from any terminal and
create an independent session.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">7. In the
child, call <b>fork()</b> again, to ensure that the daemon
can never re&minus;acquire a terminal again.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">8. Call
<b>exit()</b> in the first child, so that only the second
child (the actual daemon process) stays around. This ensures
that the daemon process is re&minus;parented to init/PID 1,
as all daemons should be.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">9. In the
daemon process, connect /dev/null to standard input, output,
and error.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">10. In the
daemon process, reset the umask to 0, so that the file modes
passed to <b>open()</b>, <b>mkdir()</b> and suchlike
directly control the access mode of the created files and
directories.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">11. In the
daemon process, change the current directory to the root
directory (/), in order to avoid that the daemon
involuntarily blocks mount points from being unmounted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">12. In the
daemon process, write the daemon PID (as returned by
<b>getpid()</b>) to a PID file, for example /run/foobar.pid
(for a hypothetical daemon &quot;foobar&quot;) to ensure
that the daemon cannot be started more than once. This must
be implemented in race&minus;free fashion so that the PID
file is only updated when it is verified at the same time
that the PID previously stored in the PID file no longer
exists or belongs to a foreign process.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">13. In the
daemon process, drop privileges, if possible and
applicable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">14. From the
daemon process, notify the original process started that
initialization is complete. This can be implemented via an
unnamed pipe or similar communication channel that is
created before the first <b>fork()</b> and hence available
in both the original and the daemon process.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">15. Call
<b>exit()</b> in the original process. The process that
invoked the daemon must be able to rely on that this
<b>exit()</b> happens after initialization is complete and
all external communication channels are established and
accessible.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The BSD
<b>daemon()</b> function should not be used, as it
implements only a subset of these steps.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A daemon that
needs to provide compatibility with SysV systems should
implement the scheme pointed out above. However, it is
recommended to make this behavior optional and configurable
via a command line argument to ease debugging as well as to
simplify integration into systems using systemd.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>New&minus;Style
Daemons</b> <br>
Modern services for Linux should be implemented as
new&minus;style daemons. This makes it easier to supervise
and control them at runtime and simplifies their
implementation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For developing
a new&minus;style daemon, none of the initialization steps
recommended for SysV daemons need to be implemented.
New&minus;style init systems such as systemd make all of
them redundant. Moreover, since some of these steps
interfere with process monitoring, file descriptor passing
and other functionality of the init system, it is
recommended not to execute them when run as new&minus;style
service.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
new&minus;style init systems guarantee execution of daemon
processes in a clean process context: it is guaranteed that
the environment block is sanitized, that the signal handlers
and mask is reset and that no left&minus;over file
descriptors are passed. Daemons will be executed in their
own session, with standard input/output/error connected to
/dev/null unless otherwise configured. The umask is
reset.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is
recommended for new&minus;style daemons to implement the
following:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">1. If
<b>SIGTERM</b> is received, shut down the daemon and exit
cleanly.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">2. If
<b>SIGHUP</b> is received, reload the configuration files,
if this applies.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">3. Provide a
correct exit code from the main daemon process, as this is
used by the init system to detect service errors and
problems. It is recommended to follow the exit code scheme
as defined in the <b><font color="#0000FF">LSB
recommendations for SysV init scripts</font></b>
<small><font color="#000000">[1]</font></small>
<font color="#000000">.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">4.
If possible and applicable, expose the daemon's control
interface via the D&minus;Bus IPC system and grab a bus name
as last step of initialization.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">5.
For integration in systemd, provide a .service unit file
that carries information about starting, stopping and
otherwise maintaining the daemon. See
<b>systemd.service</b>(5) for details.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">6.
As much as possible, rely on the init system's functionality
to limit the access of the daemon to files, services and
other resources, i.e. in the case of systemd, rely on
systemd's resource limit control instead of implementing
your own, rely on systemd's privilege dropping code instead
of implementing it in the daemon, and similar. See
<b>systemd.exec</b>(5) for the available
controls.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">7.
If D&minus;Bus is used, make your daemon
bus&minus;activatable by supplying a D&minus;Bus service
activation configuration file. This has multiple advantages:
your daemon may be started lazily on&minus;demand; it may be
started in parallel to other daemons requiring it
&minus;&minus; which maximizes parallelization and
boot&minus;up speed; your daemon can be restarted on failure
without losing any bus requests, as the bus queues requests
for activatable services. See below for details.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">8.
If your daemon provides services to other local processes or
remote clients via a socket, it should be made
socket&minus;activatable following the scheme pointed out
below. Like D&minus;Bus activation, this enables
on&minus;demand starting of services as well as it allows
improved parallelization of service start&minus;up. Also,
for state&minus;less protocols (such as syslog, DNS), a
daemon implementing socket&minus;based activation can be
restarted without losing a single request. See below for
details.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">9.
If applicable, a daemon should notify the init system about
startup completion or status updates via the
<b>sd_notify</b>(3) interface.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">10.
Instead of using the <b>syslog()</b> call to log directly to
the system syslog service, a new&minus;style daemon may
choose to simply log to standard error via <b>fprintf()</b>,
which is then forwarded to syslog by the init system. If log
levels are necessary, these can be encoded by prefixing
individual log lines with strings like &quot;&lt;4&gt;&quot;
(for log level 4 &quot;WARNING&quot; in the syslog priority
scheme), following a similar style as the Linux kernel's
<b>printk()</b> level system. For details, see
<b>sd-daemon</b>(3) and <b>systemd.exec</b>(5).</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">These
recommendations are similar but not identical to the</font>
<b><font color="#0000FF">Apple MacOS X Daemon
Requirements</font></b>

<font color="#000000">.</font></p>

<h2>ACTIVATION
<a name="ACTIVATION"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">New&minus;style
init systems provide multiple additional mechanisms to
activate services, as detailed below. It is common that
services are configured to be activated via more than one
mechanism at the same time. An example for systemd:
bluetoothd.service might get activated either when Bluetooth
hardware is plugged in, or when an application accesses its
programming interfaces via D&minus;Bus. Or, a print server
daemon might get activated when traffic arrives at an IPP
port, or when a printer is plugged in, or when a file is
queued in the printer spool directory. Even for services
that are intended to be started on system bootup
unconditionally, it is a good idea to implement some of the
various activation schemes outlined below, in order to
maximize parallelization. If a daemon implements a
D&minus;Bus service or listening socket, implementing the
full bus and socket activation scheme allows starting of the
daemon with its clients in parallel (which speeds up
boot&minus;up), since all its communication channels are
established already, and no request is lost because client
requests will be queued by the bus system (in case of
D&minus;Bus) or the kernel (in case of sockets) until the
activation is completed.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>Activation
on Boot</b> <br>
Old&minus;style daemons are usually activated exclusively on
boot (and manually by the administrator) via SysV init
scripts, as detailed in the</font>
<b><font color="#0000FF">LSB Linux Standard Base Core
Specification</font></b>
<small><font color="#000000">[1]</font></small>
<font color="#000000">. This method of activation is
supported ubiquitously on Linux init systems, both
old&minus;style and new&minus;style systems. Among other
issues, SysV init scripts have the disadvantage of involving
shell scripts in the boot process. New&minus;style init
systems generally employ updated versions of activation,
both during boot&minus;up and during runtime and using more
minimal service description files.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">In
systemd, if the developer or administrator wants to make
sure that a service or other unit is activated automatically
on boot, it is recommended to place a symlink to the unit
file in the .wants/ directory of either
multi&minus;user.target or graphical.target, which are
normally used as boot targets at system startup. See
<b>systemd.unit</b>(5) for details about the .wants/
directories, and <b>systemd.special</b>(7) for details about
the two boot targets.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>Socket&minus;Based
Activation</b> <br>
In order to maximize the possible parallelization and
robustness and simplify configuration and development, it is
recommended for all new&minus;style daemons that communicate
via listening sockets to employ socket&minus;based
activation. In a socket&minus;based activation scheme, the
creation and binding of the listening socket as primary
communication channel of daemons to local (and sometimes
remote) clients is moved out of the daemon code and into the
init system. Based on per&minus;daemon configuration, the
init system installs the sockets and then hands them off to
the spawned process as soon as the respective daemon is to
be started. Optionally, activation of the service can be
delayed until the first inbound traffic arrives at the
socket to implement on&minus;demand activation of daemons.
However, the primary advantage of this scheme is that all
providers and all consumers of the sockets can be started in
parallel as soon as all sockets are established. In addition
to that, daemons can be restarted with losing only a minimal
number of client transactions, or even any client request at
all (the latter is particularly true for state&minus;less
protocols, such as DNS or syslog), because the socket stays
bound and accessible during the restart, and all requests
are queued while the daemon cannot process them.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">New&minus;style
daemons which support socket activation must be able to
receive their sockets from the init system instead of
creating and binding them themselves. For details about the
programming interfaces for this scheme provided by systemd,
see <b>sd_listen_fds</b>(3) and <b>sd-daemon</b>(3). For
details about porting existing daemons to socket&minus;based
activation, see below. With minimal effort, it is possible
to implement socket&minus;based activation in addition to
traditional internal socket creation in the same codebase in
order to support both new&minus;style and old&minus;style
init systems from the same daemon binary.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">systemd
implements socket&minus;based activation via .socket units,
which are described in <b>systemd.socket</b>(5). When
configuring socket units for socket&minus;based activation,
it is essential that all listening sockets are pulled in by
the special target unit sockets.target. It is recommended to
place a <i>WantedBy=sockets.target</i> directive in the
&quot;[Install]&quot; section to automatically add such a
dependency on installation of a socket unit. Unless
<i>DefaultDependencies=no</i> is set, the necessary ordering
dependencies are implicitly created for all socket units.
For more information about sockets.target, see
<b>systemd.special</b>(7). It is not necessary or
recommended to place any additional dependencies on socket
units (for example from multi&minus;user.target or suchlike)
when one is installed in sockets.target.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>Bus&minus;Based
Activation</b> <br>
When the D&minus;Bus IPC system is used for communication
with clients, new&minus;style daemons should employ bus
activation so that they are automatically activated when a
client application accesses their IPC interfaces. This is
configured in D&minus;Bus service files (not to be confused
with systemd service unit files!). To ensure that
D&minus;Bus uses systemd to start&minus;up and maintain the
daemon, use the <i>SystemdService=</i> directive in these
service files to configure the matching systemd service for
a D&minus;Bus service. e.g.: For a D&minus;Bus service whose
D&minus;Bus activation file is named
org.freedesktop.RealtimeKit.service, make sure to set
<i>SystemdService=rtkit&minus;daemon.service</i> in that
file to bind it to the systemd service
rtkit&minus;daemon.service. This is needed to make sure that
the daemon is started in a race&minus;free fashion when
activated via multiple mechanisms simultaneously.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>Device&minus;Based
Activation</b> <br>
Often, daemons that manage a particular type of hardware
should be activated only when the hardware of the respective
kind is plugged in or otherwise becomes available. In a
new&minus;style init system, it is possible to bind
activation to hardware plug/unplug events. In systemd,
kernel devices appearing in the sysfs/udev device tree can
be exposed as units if they are tagged with the string
&quot;systemd&quot;. Like any other kind of unit, they may
then pull in other units when activated (i.e. plugged in)
and thus implement device&minus;based activation. systemd
dependencies may be encoded in the udev database via the
<i>SYSTEMD_WANTS=</i> property. See <b>systemd.device</b>(5)
for details. Often, it is nicer to pull in services from
devices only indirectly via dedicated targets. Example:
Instead of pulling in bluetoothd.service from all the
various bluetooth dongles and other hardware available, pull
in bluetooth.target from them and bluetoothd.service from
that target. This provides for nicer abstraction and gives
administrators the option to enable bluetoothd.service via
controlling a bluetooth.target.wants/ symlink uniformly with
a command like <b>enable</b> of <b>systemctl</b>(1) instead
of manipulating the udev ruleset.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>Path&minus;Based
Activation</b> <br>
Often, runtime of daemons processing spool files or
directories (such as a printing system) can be delayed until
these file system objects change state, or become
non&minus;empty. New&minus;style init systems provide a way
to bind service activation to file system changes. systemd
implements this scheme via path&minus;based activation
configured in .path units, as outlined in
<b>systemd.path</b>(5).</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>Timer&minus;Based
Activation</b> <br>
Some daemons that implement clean&minus;up jobs that are
intended to be executed in regular intervals benefit from
timer&minus;based activation. In systemd, this is
implemented via .timer units, as described in
<b>systemd.timer</b>(5).</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>Other
Forms of Activation</b> <br>
Other forms of activation have been suggested and
implemented in some systems. However, there are often
simpler or better alternatives, or they can be put together
of combinations of the schemes above. Example: Sometimes, it
appears useful to start daemons or .socket units when a
specific IP address is configured on a network interface,
because network sockets shall be bound to the address.
However, an alternative to implement this is by utilizing
the Linux <b>IP_FREEBIND</b> socket option, as accessible
via <i>FreeBind=yes</i> in systemd socket files (see
<b>systemd.socket</b>(5) for details). This option, when
enabled, allows sockets to be bound to a non&minus;local,
not configured IP address, and hence allows bindings to a
particular IP address before it actually becomes available,
making such an explicit dependency to the configured address
redundant. Another often suggested trigger for service
activation is low system load. However, here too, a more
convincing approach might be to make proper use of features
of the operating system, in particular, the CPU or IO
scheduler of Linux. Instead of scheduling jobs from
userspace based on monitoring the OS scheduler, it is
advisable to leave the scheduling of processes to the OS
scheduler itself. systemd provides fine&minus;grained access
to the CPU and IO schedulers. If a process executed by the
init system shall not negatively impact the amount of CPU or
IO bandwidth available to other processes, it should be
configured with <i>CPUSchedulingPolicy=idle</i> and/or
<i>IOSchedulingClass=idle</i>. Optionally, this may be
combined with timer&minus;based activation to schedule
background jobs during runtime and with minimal impact on
the system, and remove it from the boot phase
itself.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>Writing
Systemd Unit Files</b> <br>
When writing systemd unit files, it is recommended to
consider the following suggestions:</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">1.
If possible, do not use the <i>Type=forking</i> setting in
service files. But if you do, make sure to set the PID file
path using <i>PIDFile=</i>. See <b>systemd.service</b>(5)
for details.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">2.
If your daemon registers a D&minus;Bus name on the bus, make
sure to use <i>Type=dbus</i> in the service file if
possible.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">3.
Make sure to set a good human&minus;readable description
string with <i>Description=</i>.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">4.
Do not disable <i>DefaultDependencies=</i>, unless you
really know what you do and your unit is involved in early
boot or late system shutdown.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">5.
Normally, little if any dependencies should need to be
defined explicitly. However, if you do configure explicit
dependencies, only refer to unit names listed on
<b>systemd.special</b>(7) or names introduced by your own
package to keep the unit file operating
system&minus;independent.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">6.
Make sure to include an &quot;[Install]&quot; section
including installation information for the unit file. See
<b>systemd.unit</b>(5) for details. To activate your service
on boot, make sure to add a
<i>WantedBy=multi&minus;user.target</i> or
<i>WantedBy=graphical.target</i> directive. To activate your
socket on boot, make sure to add
<i>WantedBy=sockets.target</i>. Usually, you also want to
make sure that when your service is installed, your socket
is installed too, hence add <i>Also=foo.socket</i> in your
service file foo.service, for a hypothetical program
foo.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>Installing
Systemd Service Files</b> <br>
At the build installation time (e.g. <b>make install</b>
during package build), packages are recommended to install
their systemd unit files in the directory returned by
<b>pkg&minus;config systemd
&minus;&minus;variable=systemdsystemunitdir</b> (for system
services) or <b>pkg&minus;config systemd
&minus;&minus;variable=systemduserunitdir</b> (for user
services). This will make the services available in the
system on explicit request but not activate them
automatically during boot. Optionally, during package
installation (e.g. <b>rpm &minus;i</b> by the
administrator), symlinks should be created in the systemd
configuration directories via the <b>enable</b> command of
the <b>systemctl</b>(1) tool to activate them automatically
on boot.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Packages
using <b>autoconf</b>(1) are recommended to use a configure
script excerpt like the following to determine the unit
installation path during source configuration:</font></p>

Makefile.am file in <b>automake</b>(1)&minus;based
projects:</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">DISTCHECK_CONFIGURE_FLAGS
= \ <br>

&minus;&minus;with&minus;systemdsystemunitdir=$$dc_install_base/$(systemdsystemunitdir)</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Finally,
unit files should be installed in the system with an
automake excerpt like the following:</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">if
HAVE_SYSTEMD <br>
systemdsystemunit_DATA = \ <br>
foobar.socket \ <br>
foobar.service <br>
endif</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">In
the <b>rpm</b>(8).spec file, use snippets like the following
to enable/disable the service during
installation/deinstallation. This makes use of the RPM
macros shipped along systemd. Consult the packaging
guidelines of your distribution for details and the
equivalent for other package managers.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">At
the top of the file:</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">BuildRequires:
systemd <br>
%{?systemd_requires}</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">And
as scriptlets, further down:</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">%post
<br>
%systemd_post foobar.service foobar.socket</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">%preun
<br>
%systemd_preun foobar.service foobar.socket</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">%postun
<br>
%systemd_postun</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">If
the service shall be restarted during upgrades, replace the
&quot;%postun&quot; scriptlet above with the
following:</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">%postun
<br>
%systemd_postun_with_restart foobar.service</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Note
that &quot;%systemd_post&quot; and
&quot;%systemd_preun&quot; expect the names of all units
that are installed/removed as arguments, separated by
spaces. &quot;%systemd_postun&quot; expects no arguments.
&quot;%systemd_postun_with_restart&quot; expects the units
to restart as arguments.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">To
facilitate upgrades from a package version that shipped only
SysV init scripts to a package version that ships both a
SysV init script and a native systemd service file, use a
fragment like the following:</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">%triggerun
&minus;&minus; foobar &lt; 0.47.11&minus;1 <br>
if /sbin/chkconfig &minus;&minus;level 5 foobar ; then <br>
/bin/systemctl &minus;&minus;no&minus;reload enable
foobar.service foobar.socket &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 || :
<br>
fi</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Where
0.47.11&minus;1 is the first package version that includes
the native unit file. This fragment will ensure that the
first time the unit file is installed, it will be enabled if
and only if the SysV init script is enabled, thus making
sure that the enable status is not changed. Note that
<b>chkconfig</b> is a command specific to Fedora which can
be used to check whether a SysV init script is enabled.
Other operating systems will have to use different commands
here.</font></p>

<h2>PORTING EXISTING DAEMONS
<a name="PORTING EXISTING DAEMONS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Since
new&minus;style init systems such as systemd are compatible
with traditional SysV init systems, it is not strictly
necessary to port existing daemons to the new style.
However, doing so offers additional functionality to the
daemons as well as simplifying integration into
new&minus;style init systems.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">To
port an existing SysV compatible daemon, the following steps
are recommended:</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">1.
If not already implemented, add an optional command line
switch to the daemon to disable daemonization. This is
useful not only for using the daemon in new&minus;style init
systems, but also to ease debugging.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">2.
If the daemon offers interfaces to other software running on
the local system via local <b>AF_UNIX</b> sockets, consider
implementing socket&minus;based activation (see above).
Usually, a minimal patch is sufficient to implement this:
Extend the socket creation in the daemon code so that
<b>sd_listen_fds</b>(3) is checked for already passed
sockets first. If sockets are passed (i.e. when
<b>sd_listen_fds()</b> returns a positive value), skip the
socket creation step and use the passed sockets. Secondly,
ensure that the file system socket nodes for local
<b>AF_UNIX</b> sockets used in the socket&minus;based
activation are not removed when the daemon shuts down, if
sockets have been passed. Third, if the daemon normally
closes all remaining open file descriptors as part of its
initialization, the sockets passed from the init system must
be spared. Since new&minus;style init systems guarantee that
no left&minus;over file descriptors are passed to executed
processes, it might be a good choice to simply skip the
closing of all remaining open file descriptors if sockets
are passed.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">3.
Write and install a systemd unit file for the service (and
the sockets if socket&minus;based activation is used, as
well as a path unit file, if the daemon processes a spool
directory), see above for details.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">4.
If the daemon exposes interfaces via D&minus;Bus, write and
install a D&minus;Bus activation file for the service, see
above for details.</font></p>
