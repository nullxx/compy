<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This set of
functions provides a POSIX-style API for the PCRE regular
expression 8-bit library. See the <b>pcreapi</b>
documentation for a description of PCRE&rsquo;s native API,
which contains much additional functionality. There is no
POSIX-style wrapper for PCRE&rsquo;s 16-bit and 32-bit
library.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The functions
described here are just wrapper functions that ultimately
call the PCRE native API. Their prototypes are defined in
the <b>pcreposix.h</b> header file, and on Unix systems the
library itself is called <b>pcreposix.a</b>, so can be
accessed by adding <b>-lpcreposix</b> to the command for
linking an application that uses them. Because the POSIX
functions call the native ones, it is also necessary to add
<b>-lpcre</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">I have
implemented only those POSIX option bits that can be
reasonably mapped to PCRE native options. In addition, the
option REG_EXTENDED is defined with the value zero. This has
no effect, but since programs that are written to the POSIX
interface often use it, this makes it easier to slot in PCRE
as a replacement library. Other POSIX options are not even
defined.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There are also
some other options that are not defined by POSIX. These have
been added at the request of users who want to make use of
certain PCRE-specific features via the POSIX calling
interface.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When PCRE is
called via these functions, it is only the API that is
POSIX-like in style. The syntax and semantics of the regular
expressions themselves are still those of Perl, subject to
the setting of various PCRE options, as described below.
&quot;POSIX-like in style&quot; means that the API
approximates to the POSIX definition; it is not fully
POSIX-compatible, and in multi-byte encoding domains it is
probably even less compatible.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The header for
these functions is supplied as <b>pcreposix.h</b> to avoid
any potential clash with other POSIX libraries. It can, of
course, be renamed or aliased as <b>regex.h</b>, which is
the &quot;correct&quot; name. It provides two structure
types, <i>regex_t</i> for compiled internal forms, and
<i>regmatch_t</i> for returning captured substrings. It also
defines some constants whose names start with
&quot;REG_&quot;; these are used for setting options and
identifying error codes.</p>

<h2>COMPILING A PATTERN
<a name="COMPILING A PATTERN"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The function
<b>regcomp()</b> is called to compile a pattern into an
internal form. The pattern is a C string terminated by a
binary zero, and is passed in the argument <i>pattern</i>.
The <i>preg</i> argument is a pointer to a <b>regex_t</b>
structure that is used as a base for storing information
about the compiled regular expression.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The argument
<i>cflags</i> is either zero, or contains one or more of the
bits defined by the following macros:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">REG_DOTALL</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The PCRE_DOTALL
option is set when the regular expression is passed for
compilation to the native function. Note that REG_DOTALL is
not part of the POSIX standard.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">REG_ICASE</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
PCRE_CASELESS option is set when the regular expression is
passed for compilation to the native function.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">REG_NEWLINE</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
PCRE_MULTILINE option is set when the regular expression is
passed for compilation to the native function. Note that
this does <i>not</i> mimic the defined POSIX behaviour for
REG_NEWLINE (see the following section).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">REG_NOSUB</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
PCRE_NO_AUTO_CAPTURE option is set when the regular
expression is passed for compilation to the native function.
In addition, when a pattern that is compiled with this flag
is passed to <b>regexec()</b> for matching, the
<i>nmatch</i> and <i>pmatch</i> arguments are ignored, and
no captured strings are returned.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">REG_UCP</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The PCRE_UCP
option is set when the regular expression is passed for
compilation to the native function. This causes PCRE to use
Unicode properties when matchine \d, \w, etc., instead of
just recognizing ASCII values. Note that REG_UTF8 is not
part of the POSIX standard.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">REG_UNGREEDY</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
PCRE_UNGREEDY option is set when the regular expression is
passed for compilation to the native function. Note that
REG_UNGREEDY is not part of the POSIX standard.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">REG_UTF8</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The PCRE_UTF8
option is set when the regular expression is passed for
compilation to the native function. This causes the pattern
itself and all data strings used for matching it to be
treated as UTF-8 strings. Note that REG_UTF8 is not part of
the POSIX standard.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In the absence
of these flags, no options are passed to the native
function. This means the the regex is compiled with PCRE
default semantics. In particular, the way it handles newline
characters in the subject string is the Perl way, not the
POSIX way. Note that setting PCRE_MULTILINE has only
<i>some</i> of the effects specified for REG_NEWLINE. It
does not affect the way newlines are matched by . (they are
not) or by a negative class such as [^a] (they are).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The yield of
<b>regcomp()</b> is zero on success, and non-zero otherwise.
The <i>preg</i> structure is filled in on success, and one
member of the structure is public: <i>re_nsub</i> contains
the number of capturing subpatterns in the regular
expression. Various error codes are defined in the header
file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">NOTE: If the
yield of <b>regcomp()</b> is non-zero, you must not attempt
to use the contents of the <i>preg</i> structure. If, for
example, you pass it to <b>regexec()</b>, the result is
undefined and your program is likely to crash.</p>

<h2>MATCHING NEWLINE CHARACTERS
<a name="MATCHING NEWLINE CHARACTERS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This area is
not simple, because POSIX and Perl take different views of
things. It is not possible to get PCRE to obey POSIX
semantics, but then PCRE was never intended to be a POSIX
engine. The following table lists the different
possibilities for matching newline characters in PCRE:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Default Change
with</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">. matches
newline no PCRE_DOTALL <br>
newline matches [^a] yes not changeable <br>
$ matches \n at end yes PCRE_DOLLARENDONLY <br>
$ matches \n in middle no PCRE_MULTILINE <br>
^ matches \n in middle no PCRE_MULTILINE</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This is the
equivalent table for POSIX:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Default Change
with</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">. matches
newline yes REG_NEWLINE <br>
newline matches [^a] yes REG_NEWLINE <br>
$ matches \n at end no REG_NEWLINE <br>
$ matches \n in middle no REG_NEWLINE <br>
^ matches \n in middle no REG_NEWLINE</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">PCRE&rsquo;s
behaviour is the same as Perl&rsquo;s, except that there is
no equivalent for PCRE_DOLLAR_ENDONLY in Perl. In both PCRE
and Perl, there is no way to stop newline from matching
[^a].</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The default
POSIX newline handling can be obtained by setting
PCRE_DOTALL and PCRE_DOLLAR_ENDONLY, but there is no way to
make PCRE behave exactly as for the REG_NEWLINE action.</p>

<h2>MATCHING A PATTERN
<a name="MATCHING A PATTERN"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The function
<b>regexec()</b> is called to match a compiled pattern
<i>preg</i> against a given <i>string</i>, which is by
default terminated by a zero byte (but see REG_STARTEND
below), subject to the options in <i>eflags</i>. These can
be:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">REG_NOTBOL</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The PCRE_NOTBOL
option is set when calling the underlying PCRE matching
function.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">REG_NOTEMPTY</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
PCRE_NOTEMPTY option is set when calling the underlying PCRE
matching function. Note that REG_NOTEMPTY is not part of the
POSIX standard. However, setting this option can give more
POSIX-like behaviour in some situations.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">REG_NOTEOL</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The PCRE_NOTEOL
option is set when calling the underlying PCRE matching
function.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">REG_STARTEND</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The string is
considered to start at <i>string</i> +
<i>pmatch[0].rm_so</i> and to have a terminating NUL located
at <i>string</i> + <i>pmatch[0].rm_eo</i> (there need not
actually be a NUL at that location), regardless of the value
of <i>nmatch</i>. This is a BSD extension, compatible with
but not specified by IEEE Standard 1003.2 (POSIX.2), and
should be used with caution in software intended to be
portable to other systems. Note that a non-zero <i>rm_so</i>
does not imply REG_NOTBOL; REG_STARTEND affects only the
location of the string, not how it is matched.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the pattern
was compiled with the REG_NOSUB flag, no data about any
matched strings is returned. The <i>nmatch</i> and
<i>pmatch</i> arguments of <b>regexec()</b> are ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the value of
<i>nmatch</i> is zero, or if the value <i>pmatch</i> is
NULL, no data about any matched strings is returned.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Otherwise,the
portion of the string that was matched, and also any
captured substrings, are returned via the <i>pmatch</i>
argument, which points to an array of <i>nmatch</i>
structures of type <i>regmatch_t</i>, containing the members
<i>rm_so</i> and <i>rm_eo</i>. These contain the offset to
the first character of each substring and the offset to the
first character after the end of each substring,
respectively. The 0th element of the vector relates to the
entire portion of <i>string</i> that was matched; subsequent
elements relate to the capturing subpatterns of the regular
expression. Unused entries in the array have both structure
members set to -1.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A successful
match yields a zero return; various error codes are defined
in the header file, of which REG_NOMATCH is the
&quot;expected&quot; failure code.</p>

<h2>ERROR MESSAGES
<a name="ERROR MESSAGES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>regerror()</b> function maps a non-zero errorcode from
either <b>regcomp()</b> or <b>regexec()</b> to a printable
message. If <i>preg</i> is not NULL, the error should have
arisen from the use of that structure. A message terminated
by a binary zero is placed in <i>errbuf</i>. The length of
the message, including the zero, is limited to
<i>errbuf_size</i>. The yield of the function is the size of
buffer needed to hold the whole message.</p>

<h2>MEMORY USAGE
<a name="MEMORY USAGE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Compiling a
regular expression causes memory to be allocated and
associated with the <i>preg</i> structure. The function
<b>regfree()</b> frees all such memory, after which
<i>preg</i> may no longer be used as a compiled
expression.</p>
