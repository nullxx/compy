<h2>DESCRIPTION

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>read</i>() function shall attempt to read <i>nbyte</i>
bytes from the file associated with the open file
descriptor, <i>fildes</i>, into the buffer pointed to by
<i>buf</i>. The behavior of multiple concurrent reads on the
same pipe, FIFO, or terminal device is unspecified.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Before any
action described below is taken, and if <i>nbyte</i> is
zero, the <i>read</i>() function may detect and return
errors as described below. In the absence of errors, or if
error detection is not performed, the <i>read</i>() function
shall return zero and have no other results.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On files that
support seeking (for example, a regular file), the
<i>read</i>() shall start at a position in the file given by
the file offset associated with <i>fildes</i>. The file
offset shall be incremented by the number of bytes actually
read.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Files that do
not support seeking-for example, terminals-always read from
the current position. The value of a file offset associated
with such a file is undefined.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">No data
transfer shall occur past the current end-of-file. If the
starting position is at or after the end-of-file, 0 shall be
returned. If the file refers to a device special file, the
result of subsequent <i>read</i>() requests is
implementation-defined.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the value of
<i>nbyte</i> is greater than {SSIZE_MAX}, the result is
implementation-defined.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>read</i>() function reads data previously written to a
file. If any portion of a regular file prior to the
end-of-file has not been written, <i>read</i>() shall return
bytes with value 0. For example, <i>lseek</i>() allows the
file offset to be set beyond the end of existing data in the
file. If data is later written at this point, subsequent
reads in the gap between the previous end of data and the
newly written data shall return bytes with value 0 until
data is written into the gap.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Upon successful
completion, where <i>nbyte</i> is greater than 0,
<i>read</i>() shall mark for update the <i>st_atime</i>
field of the file, and shall return the number of bytes
read. This number shall never be greater than <i>nbyte</i>.
The value returned may be less than <i>nbyte</i> if the
number of bytes left in the file is less than <i>nbyte</i>,
if the <i>read</i>() request was interrupted by a signal, or
if the file is a pipe or FIFO or special file and has fewer
than <i>nbyte</i> bytes immediately available for reading.
For example, a <i>read</i>() from a file associated with a
terminal may return one typed line of data.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If a
<i>read</i>() is interrupted by a signal before it reads any
data, it shall return -1 with <i>errno</i> set to
[EINTR].</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If a
<i>read</i>() is interrupted by a signal after it has
successfully read some data, it shall return the number of
bytes read.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For regular
files, no data transfer shall occur past the offset maximum
established in the open file description associated with
<i>fildes</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If
<i>fildes</i> refers to a socket, <i>read</i>() shall be
equivalent to <i>recv</i>() with no flags set.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the O_DSYNC
and O_RSYNC bits have been set, read I/O operations on the
file descriptor shall complete as defined by synchronized
I/O data integrity completion. If the O_SYNC and O_RSYNC
bits have been set, read I/O operations on the file
descriptor shall complete as defined by synchronized I/O
file integrity completion.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If
<i>fildes</i> refers to a shared memory object, the result
of the <i>read</i>() function is unspecified.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If
<i>fildes</i> refers to a typed memory object, the result of
the <i>read</i>() function is unspecified.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A <i>read</i>()
from a STREAMS file can read data in three different modes:
<i>byte-stream</i> mode, <i>message-nondiscard</i> mode, and
<i>message-discard</i> mode. The default shall be
byte-stream mode. This can be changed using the I_SRDOPT
<i>ioctl</i>() request, and can be tested with I_GRDOPT
<i>ioctl</i>(). In byte-stream mode, <i>read</i>() shall
retrieve data from the STREAM until as many bytes as were
requested are transferred, or until there is no more data to
be retrieved. Byte-stream mode ignores message
boundaries.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In STREAMS
message-nondiscard mode, <i>read</i>() shall retrieve data
until as many bytes as were requested are transferred, or
until a message boundary is reached. If <i>read</i>() does
not retrieve all the data in a message, the remaining data
shall be left on the STREAM, and can be retrieved by the
next <i>read</i>() call. Message-discard mode also retrieves
data until as many bytes as were requested are transferred,
or a message boundary is reached. However, unread data
remaining in a message after the <i>read</i>() returns shall
be discarded, and shall not be available for a subsequent
<i>read</i>(), <i>getmsg</i>(), or <i>getpmsg</i>()
call.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">How
<i>read</i>() handles zero-byte STREAMS messages is
determined by the current read mode setting. In byte-stream
mode, <i>read</i>() shall accept data until it has read
<i>nbyte</i> bytes, or until there is no more data to read,
or until a zero-byte message block is encountered. The
<i>read</i>() function shall then return the number of bytes
read, and place the zero-byte message back on the STREAM to
be retrieved by the next <i>read</i>(), <i>getmsg</i>(), or
<i>getpmsg</i>(). In message-nondiscard mode or
message-discard mode, a zero-byte message shall return 0 and
the message shall be removed from the STREAM. When a
zero-byte message is read as the first message on a STREAM,
the message shall be removed from the STREAM and 0 shall be
returned, regardless of the read mode.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A <i>read</i>()
from a STREAMS file shall return the data in the message at
the front of the STREAM head read queue, regardless of the
priority band of the message.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">By default,
STREAMs are in control-normal mode, in which a <i>read</i>()
from a STREAMS file can only process messages that contain a
data part but do not contain a control part. The
<i>read</i>() shall fail if a message containing a control
part is encountered at the STREAM head. This default action
can be changed by placing the STREAM in either control-data
mode or control-discard mode with the I_SRDOPT
<i>ioctl</i>() command. In control-data mode, <i>read</i>()
shall convert any control part to data and pass it to the
application before passing any data part originally present
in the same message. In control-discard mode, <i>read</i>()
shall discard message control parts but return to the
process any data part in the message.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In addition,
<i>read</i>() shall fail if the STREAM head had processed an
asynchronous error before the call. In this case, the value
of <i>errno</i> shall not reflect the result of
<i>read</i>(), but reflect the prior error. If a hangup
occurs on the STREAM being read, <i>read</i>() shall
continue to operate normally until the STREAM head read
queue is empty. Thereafter, it shall return 0.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>pread</i>() function shall be equivalent to
<i>read</i>(), except that it shall read from a given
position in the file without changing the file pointer. The
first three arguments to <i>pread</i>() are the same as
<i>read</i>() with the addition of a fourth argument
<i>offset</i> for the desired position inside the file. An
attempt to perform a <i>pread</i>() on a file that is
incapable of seeking shall result in an error.</p>

<h2>RETURN VALUE

</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Upon successful
completion, <i>read</i>() and <i>pread</i>() shall return a

<h2>RATIONALE
<a name="RATIONALE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This volume of
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 does not specify the value of
the file offset after an error is returned; there are too
many cases. For programming errors, such as [EBADF], the
concept is meaningless since no file is involved. For errors
that are detected immediately, such as [EAGAIN], clearly the
pointer should not change. After an interrupt or hardware
error, however, an updated value would be very useful and is
the behavior of many implementations.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that a
<i>read</i>() of zero bytes does not modify <i>st_atime</i>.
A <i>read</i>() that requests more than zero bytes, but
returns zero, shall modify <i>st_atime</i>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Implementations
are allowed, but not required, to perform error checking for
<i>read</i>() requests of zero bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Input and
Output</b> <br>
The use of I/O with large byte counts has always presented
problems. Ideas such as <i>lread</i>() and <i>lwrite</i>()
(using and returning <b>long</b>s) were considered at one
time. The current solution is to use abstract types on the
ISO&nbsp;C standard function to <i>read</i>() and
<i>write</i>(). The abstract types can be declared so that
existing functions work, but can also be declared so that
larger types can be represented in future implementations.
It is presumed that whatever constraints limit the maximum
range of <b>size_t</b> also limit portable I/O requests to
the same range. This volume of
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 also limits the range further
by requiring that the byte count be limited so that a signed
return value remains meaningful. Since the return type is
also a (signed) abstract type, the byte count can be defined
by the implementation to be larger than an <b>int</b> can
hold.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The standard
developers considered adding atomicity requirements to a
pipe or FIFO, but recognized that due to the nature of pipes
and FIFOs there could be no guarantee of atomicity of reads
of {PIPE_BUF} or any other size that would be an aid to
applications portability.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This volume of
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires that no action be
taken for <i>read</i>() or <i>write</i>() when <i>nbyte</i>
is zero. This is not intended to take precedence over
detection of errors (such as invalid buffer pointers or file
descriptors). This is consistent with the rest of this
volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001, but the phrasing
here could be misread to require detection of the zero case
before any other errors. A value of zero is to be considered
a correct value, for which the semantics are a no-op.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">I/O is intended
to be atomic to ordinary files and pipes and FIFOs. Atomic
means that all the bytes from a single operation that
started out together end up together, without interleaving
from other I/O operations. It is a known attribute of
terminals that this is not honored, and terminals are
explicitly (and implicitly permanently) excepted, making the
behavior unspecified. The behavior for other device types is
also left unspecified, but the wording is intended to imply
that future standards might choose to specify atomicity (or
not).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There were
recommendations to add format parameters to <i>read</i>()
and <i>write</i>() in order to handle networked transfers
among heterogeneous file system and base hardware types.
Such a facility may be required for support by the OSI
presentation of layer services. However, it was determined
that this should correspond with similar C-language
facilities, and that is beyond the scope of this volume of
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001. The concept was suggested to
the developers of the ISO&nbsp;C standard for their
consideration as a possible area for future work.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In 4.3 BSD, a
<i>read</i>() or <i>write</i>() that is interrupted by a
signal before transferring any data does not by default
return an [EINTR] error, but is restarted. In 4.2 BSD, 4.3
BSD, and the Eighth Edition, there is an additional
function, <i>select</i>(), whose purpose is to pause until
specified activity (data to read, space to write, and so on)
is detected on specified file descriptors. It is common in
applications written for those systems for <i>select</i>()
to be used before <i>read</i>() in situations (such as
keyboard input) where interruption of I/O due to a signal is
desired.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The issue of
which files or file types are interruptible is considered an
implementation design issue. This is often affected
primarily by hardware and reliability issues.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There are no
references to actions taken following an &quot;unrecoverable
error&quot;. It is considered beyond the scope of this
volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 to describe what
happens in the case of hardware errors.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Previous
versions of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 allowed two very
different behaviors with regard to the handling of
interrupts. In order to minimize the resulting confusion, it
was decided that IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 should
support only one of these behaviors. Historical practice on
AT&amp;T-derived systems was to have <i>read</i>() and
<i>write</i>() return -1 and set <i>errno</i> to [EINTR]
when interrupted after some, but not all, of the data
requested had been transferred. However, the U.S. Department
of Commerce FIPS 151-1 and FIPS 151-2 require the historical
BSD behavior, in which <i>read</i>() and <i>write</i>()
return the number of bytes actually transferred before the
interrupt. If -1 is returned when any data is transferred,
it is difficult to recover from the error on a seekable
device and impossible on a non-seekable device. Most new
implementations support this behavior. The behavior required
by IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 is to return the number of
bytes transferred.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001
does not specify when an implementation that buffers
<i>read</i>()ss actually moves the data into the
user-supplied buffer, so an implementation may chose to do
this at the latest possible moment. Therefore, an interrupt
arriving earlier may not cause <i>read</i>() to return a
partial byte count, but rather to return -1 and set
<i>errno</i> to [EINTR].</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Consideration
was also given to combining the two previous options, and
setting <i>errno</i> to [EINTR] while returning a short
count. However, not only is there no existing practice that
implements this, it is also contradictory to the idea that
when <i>errno</i> is set, the function responsible shall
return -1.</p>
