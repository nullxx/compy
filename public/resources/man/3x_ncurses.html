&minus; CRT screen handling and optimization package</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>#include
&lt;curses.h&gt;</b></p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>ncurses</b> library routines give the user a
terminal-independent method of updating character screens
with reasonable optimization. This implementation is
&lsquo;&lsquo;new curses&rsquo;&rsquo; (ncurses) and is the
approved replacement for 4.4BSD classic curses, which has
been discontinued. This describes <b>ncurses</b> version 5.9
(patch 20130511).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>ncurses</b> library emulates the curses library of System
V Release 4 UNIX, and XPG4 (X/Open Portability Guide) curses
(also known as XSI curses). XSI stands for X/Open System
Interfaces Extension. The <b>ncurses</b> library is freely
redistributable in source form. Differences from the SVr4
curses are summarized under the <b>EXTENSIONS</b> and
<b>PORTABILITY</b> sections below and described in detail in
the respective <b>EXTENSIONS</b>, <b>PORTABILITY</b> and
<b>BUGS</b> sections of individual man pages.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>ncurses</b> library also provides many useful extensions,
i.e., features which cannot be implemented by a simple
add-on library but which require access to the internals of
the library.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A program using
these routines must be linked with the
<b>&minus;lncurses</b> option, or (if it has been generated)
with the debugging library <b>&minus;lncurses_g</b>. (Your
system integrator may also have installed these libraries
under the names <b>&minus;lcurses</b> and
<b>&minus;lcurses_g</b>.) The ncurses_g library generates
trace logs (in a file called &rsquo;trace&rsquo; in the
current directory) that describe curses actions. See also
the section on <b>ALTERNATE CONFIGURATIONS</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>ncurses</b> package supports: overall screen, window and
pad manipulation; output to windows and pads; reading
terminal input; control over terminal and <b>curses</b>
input and output options; environment query routines; color
manipulation; use of soft label keys; terminfo capabilities;
and access to low-level terminal-manipulation routines.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The library
uses the locale which the calling program has initialized.
That is normally done with <b>setlocale</b>:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>setlocale(LC_ALL,
&quot;&quot;);</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the locale
is not initialized, the library assumes that characters are
printable as in ISO&minus;8859&minus;1, to work with certain
legacy programs. You should initialize the locale and not
rely on specific details of the library when the locale has
not been setup.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The function
<b>initscr</b> or <b>newterm</b> must be called to
initialize the library before any of the other routines that
deal with windows and screens are used. The routine
<b>endwin</b> must be called before exiting.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To get
character-at-a-time input without echoing (most interactive,
screen oriented programs want this), the following sequence
should be used:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>initscr();
cbreak(); noecho();</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Most programs
would additionally use the sequence:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>nonl(); <br>
intrflush(stdscr, FALSE); <br>
keypad(stdscr, TRUE);</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Before a
<b>curses</b> program is run, the tab stops of the terminal
should be set and its initialization strings, if defined,
must be output. This can be done by executing the <b>tput
init</b> command after the shell environment variable
<b>TERM</b> has been exported. <b>tset(1)</b> is usually
responsible for doing this. [See <b>terminfo</b>(5) for
further details.]</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>ncurses</b> library permits manipulation of data
structures, called <i>windows</i>, which can be thought of
as two-dimensional arrays of characters representing all or
part of a CRT screen. A default window called <b>stdscr</b>,
which is the size of the terminal screen, is supplied.
Others may be created with <b>newwin</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
<b>curses</b> does not handle overlapping windows,
that&rsquo;s done by the <b>panel</b>(3X) library. This
means that you can either use <b>stdscr</b> or divide the
screen into tiled windows and not using <b>stdscr</b> at
all. Mixing the two will result in unpredictable, and
undesired, effects.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Windows are
referred to by variables declared as <b>WINDOW *</b>. These
data structures are manipulated with routines described here
and elsewhere in the <b>ncurses</b> manual pages. Among
those, the most basic routines are <b>move</b> and
<b>addch</b>. More general versions of these routines are
included with names beginning with <b>w</b>, allowing the
user to specify a window. The routines not beginning with
<b>w</b> affect <b>stdscr</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">After using
routines to manipulate a window, <b>refresh</b> is called,
telling <b>curses</b> to make the user&rsquo;s CRT screen
look like <b>stdscr</b>. The characters in a window are
actually of type <b>chtype</b>, (character and attribute
data) so that other information about the character may also
be stored with each character.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Special windows
called <i>pads</i> may also be manipulated. These are
windows which are not constrained to the size of the screen
and whose contents need not be completely displayed. See
<b>curs_pad</b>(3X) for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In addition to
drawing characters on the screen, video attributes and
colors may be supported, causing the characters to show up
in such modes as underlined, in reverse video, or in color
on terminals that support such display enhancements. Line
drawing characters may be specified to be output. On input,
<b>curses</b> is also able to translate arrow and function
keys that transmit escape sequences into single values. The
video attributes, line drawing characters, and input values
use names, defined in <b>&lt;curses.h&gt;</b>, such as
<b>A_REVERSE</b>, <b>ACS_HLINE</b>, and <b>KEY_LEFT</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the
environment variables <b>LINES</b> and <b>COLUMNS</b> are
set, or if the program is executing in a window environment,
line and column information in the environment will override
information read by <i>terminfo</i>. This would affect a
program running in an AT&amp;T 630 layer, for example, where
the size of a screen is changeable (see
<b>ENVIRONMENT</b>).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the
environment variable <b>TERMINFO</b> is defined, any program
using <b>curses</b> checks for a local terminal definition
before checking in the standard place. For example, if
<b>TERM</b> is set to <b>att4424</b>, then the compiled
terminal definition is found in</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>/usr/share/terminfo/a/att4424</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">(The <b>a</b>
is copied from the first letter of <b>att4424</b> to avoid
creation of huge directories.) However, if <b>TERMINFO</b>
is set to <b>$HOME/myterms</b>, <b>curses</b> first
checks</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>$HOME/myterms/a/att4424</b>,</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">and if that
fails, it then checks</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>/usr/share/terminfo/a/att4424</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This is useful
for developing experimental definitions or when write
permission in <b>/usr/share/terminfo</b> is not
available.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The integer
variables <b>LINES</b> and <b>COLS</b> are defined in
<b>&lt;curses.h&gt;</b> and will be filled in by
<b>initscr</b> with the size of the screen. The constants
<b>TRUE</b> and <b>FALSE</b> have the values <b>1</b> and
<b>0</b>, respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>curses</b> routines also define the <b>WINDOW *</b>
variable <b>curscr</b> which is used for certain low-level
operations like clearing and redrawing a screen containing
garbage. The <b>curscr</b> can be used in only a few
routines.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Routine and
Argument Names</b> <br>
Many <b>curses</b> routines have two or more versions. The
routines prefixed with <b>w</b> require a window argument.
The routines prefixed with <b>p</b> require a pad argument.
Those without a prefix generally use <b>stdscr</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The routines
prefixed with <b>mv</b> require a <i>y</i> and <i>x</i>
coordinate to move to before performing the appropriate
action. The <b>mv</b> routines imply a call to <b>move</b>
before the call to the other routine. The coordinate
<i>y</i> always refers to the row (of the window), and
<i>x</i> always refers to the column. The upper left-hand
corner is always (0,0), not (1,1).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The routines
prefixed with <b>mvw</b> take both a window argument and
<i>x</i> and <i>y</i> coordinates. The window argument is
always specified before the coordinates.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In each case,
<i>win</i> is the window affected, and <i>pad</i> is the pad
affected; <i>win</i> and <i>pad</i> are always pointers to
type <b>WINDOW</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Option setting
routines require a Boolean flag <i>bf</i> with the value
<b>TRUE</b> or <b>FALSE</b>; <i>bf</i> is always of type
<b>bool</b>. Most of the data types used in the library
routines, such as <b>WINDOW</b>, <b>SCREEN</b>, <b>bool</b>,
and <b>chtype</b> are defined in <b>&lt;curses.h&gt;</b>.
Types used for the terminfo routines such as <b>TERMINAL</b>
are defined in <b>&lt;term.h&gt;</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This manual
page describes functions which may appear in any
configuration of the library. There are two common
configurations of the library:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">ncurses</p>

<p style="margin-left:29%;">the &quot;normal&quot; library,
which handles 8-bit characters. The normal (8-bit) library
stores characters combined with attributes in <b>chtype</b>
data.</p>

<p style="margin-left:29%; margin-top: 1em">Attributes
alone (no corresponding character) may be stored in
<b>chtype</b> or the equivalent <b>attr_t</b> data. In
either case, the data is stored in something like an
integer.</p>

<p style="margin-left:29%; margin-top: 1em">Each cell (row
and column) in a <b>WINDOW</b> is stored as a
<b>chtype</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">ncursesw</p>

<p style="margin-left:29%;">the so-called &quot;wide&quot;
library, which handles multibyte characters (see the section
on <b>ALTERNATE CONFIGURATIONS</b>). The &quot;wide&quot;
library includes all of the calls from the
&quot;normal&quot; library. It adds about one third more
calls using data types which store multibyte characters:
<b><br>
cchar_t</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:37%;">corresponds to <b>chtype</b>.
However it is a structure, because more data is stored than
can fit into an integer. The characters are large enough to
require a full integer value &minus; and there may be more
than one character per cell. The video attributes and color
are stored in separate fields of the structure.</p>

<p style="margin-left:37%; margin-top: 1em">Each cell (row
and column) in a <b>WINDOW</b> is stored as a
<b>cchar_t</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:29%;"><b>wchar_t</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:37%;">stores a &quot;wide&quot;
character. Like <b>chtype</b>, this may be an integer.</p>

<p style="margin-left:29%;"><b>wint_t</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:37%;">stores a <b>wchar_t</b> or
<b>WEOF</b> &minus; not the same, though both may have the
same size.</p>

<p style="margin-left:29%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;wide&quot; library provides new functions which are
analogous to functions in the &quot;normal&quot; library.
There is a naming convention which relates many of the
normal/wide variants: a &quot;_w&quot; is inserted into the
name. For example, <b>waddch</b> becomes
<b>wadd_wch</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Routine Name
Index</b> <br>
The following table lists each <b>curses</b> routine and the
name of the manual page on which it is described. Routines
flagged with &lsquo;*&rsquo; are ncurses-specific, not
described by XPG4 or present in SVr4.</p>

<h2>RETURN VALUE
<a name="RETURN VALUE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Routines that
return an integer return <b>ERR</b> upon failure and an
integer value other than <b>ERR</b> upon successful
completion, unless otherwise noted in the routine
descriptions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As a general
rule, routines check for null pointers passed as parameters,
and handle this as an error.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">All macros
return the value of the <b>w</b> version, except
<b>setscrreg</b>, <b>wsetscrreg</b>, <b>getyx</b>,
<b>getbegyx</b>, and <b>getmaxyx</b>. The return values of
<b>setscrreg</b>, <b>wsetscrreg</b>, <b>getyx</b>,
<b>getbegyx</b>, and <b>getmaxyx</b> are undefined (i.e.,
these should not be used as the right-hand side of
assignment statements).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Routines that
return pointers return <b>NULL</b> on error.</p>

<h2>ENVIRONMENT
<a name="ENVIRONMENT"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
environment symbols are useful for customizing the runtime
behavior of the <b>ncurses</b> library. The most important
ones have been already discussed in detail. <br>
BAUDRATE</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The debugging library checks
this environment variable when the application has
redirected output to a file. The variable&rsquo;s numeric
value is used for the baudrate. If no value is found,
<b>ncurses</b> uses 9600. This allows testers to construct
repeatable test-cases that take into account costs that
depend on baudrate.</p>

<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="82%">


<p>When set, change occurrences of the command_character
(i.e., the <b>cmdch</b> capability) of the loaded terminfo
entries to the value of this variable. Very few terminfo
entries provide this feature.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">Because this
name is also used in development environments to represent
the C compiler&rsquo;s name, <b>ncurses</b> ignores it if it
does not happen to be a single character.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">COLUMNS</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Specify the width of the screen
in characters. Applications running in a windowing
environment usually are able to obtain the width of the
window in which they are executing. If neither the
<b>COLUMNS</b> value nor the terminal&rsquo;s screen size is
available, <b>ncurses</b> uses the size which may be
specified in the terminfo database (i.e., the <b>cols</b>
capability).</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">It is important
that your application use a correct size for the screen.
This is not always possible because your application may be
running on a host which does not honor NAWS (Negotiations
About Window Size), or because you are temporarily running
as another user. However, setting <b>COLUMNS</b> and/or
<b>LINES</b> overrides the library&rsquo;s use of the screen
size obtained from the operating system.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">Either
<b>COLUMNS</b> or <b>LINES</b> symbols may be specified
independently. This is mainly useful to circumvent legacy
misfeatures of terminal descriptions, e.g., xterm which
commonly specifies a 65 line screen. For best results,
<b>lines</b> and <b>cols</b> should not be specified in a
terminal description for terminals which are run as
emulations.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">Use the
<b>use_env</b> function to disable all use of external
environment (but not including system calls) to determine
the screen size. Use the <b>use_tioctl</b> function to
update <b>COLUMNS</b> or <b>LINES</b> to match the screen
size obtained from system calls or the terminal
database.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">ESCDELAY</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Specifies the total time, in
milliseconds, for which ncurses will await a character
sequence, e.g., a function key. The default value, 1000
milliseconds, is enough for most uses. However, it is made a
variable to accommodate unusual applications.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">The most common
instance where you may wish to change this value is to work
with slow hosts, e.g., running on a network. If the host
cannot read characters rapidly enough, it will have the same
effect as if the terminal did not send characters rapidly
enough. The library will still see a timeout.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">Note that xterm
mouse events are built up from character sequences received
from the xterm. If your application makes heavy use of
multiple-clicking, you may wish to lengthen this default
value because the timeout applies to the composed
multi-click event as well as the individual clicks.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">In addition to
the environment variable, this implementation provides a
global variable with the same name. Portable applications
should not rely upon the presence of ESCDELAY in either
form, but setting the environment variable rather than the
global variable does not create problems when compiling an
application.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">$HOME/.termcap
<br>
$HOME/.terminfo</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">LINES</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Like COLUMNS, specify the
height of the screen in characters. See COLUMNS for a
detailed description.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">MOUSE_BUTTONS_123</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">This applies only to the OS/2
EMX port. It specifies the order of buttons on the mouse.
OS/2 numbers a 3-button mouse inconsistently from other
platforms:</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">1 = left <br>
2 = right <br>
3 = middle.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">This variable
lets you customize the mouse. The variable must be three
numeric digits 1&minus;3 in any order, e.g., 123 or 321. If
it is not specified, <b>ncurses</b> uses 132.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">NCURSES_ASSUMED_COLORS</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Override the compiled-in
assumption that the terminal&rsquo;s default colors are
white-on-black (see <b>default_colors</b>(3X)). You may set
the foreground and background color values with this
environment variable by proving a 2-element list:
foreground,background. For example, to tell ncurses to not
assume anything about the colors, set this to
&quot;&minus;1,&minus;1&quot;. To make it green-on-black,
set it to &quot;2,0&quot;. Any positive value from zero to
the terminfo <b>max_colors</b> value is allowed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">NCURSES_GPM_TERMS</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">This applies only to ncurses
configured to use the GPM interface.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">If present, the
environment variable is a list of one or more terminal names
against which the TERM environment variable is matched.
Setting it to an empty value disables the GPM interface;
using the built-in support for xterm, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">If the
environment variable is absent, ncurses will attempt to open
GPM if TERM contains &quot;linux&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">NCURSES_NO_HARD_TABS</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;"><b>Ncurses</b> may use tabs as
part of the cursor movement optimization. In some cases,
your terminal driver may not handle these properly. Set this
environment variable to disable the feature. You can also
adjust your <b>stty</b> settings to avoid the problem.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">NCURSES_NO_MAGIC_COOKIES</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Some terminals use a
magic-cookie feature which requires special handling to make
highlighting and other video attributes display properly.
You can suppress the highlighting entirely for these
terminals by setting this environment variable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">NCURSES_NO_PADDING</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Most of the terminal
descriptions in the terminfo database are written for real
&quot;hardware&quot; terminals. Many people use terminal
emulators which run in a windowing environment and use
curses-based applications. Terminal emulators can duplicate
all of the important aspects of a hardware terminal, but
they do not have the same limitations. The chief limitation
of a hardware terminal from the standpoint of your
application is the management of dataflow, i.e., timing.
Unless a hardware terminal is interfaced into a terminal
concentrator (which does flow control), it (or your
application) must manage dataflow, preventing overruns. The
cheapest solution (no hardware cost) is for your program to
do this by pausing after operations that the terminal does
slowly, such as clearing the display.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">As a result,
many terminal descriptions (including the vt100) have delay
times embedded. You may wish to use these descriptions, but
not want to pay the performance penalty.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">Set the
NCURSES_NO_PADDING environment variable to disable all but
mandatory padding. Mandatory padding is used as a part of
special control sequences such as <i>flash</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">NCURSES_NO_SETBUF</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">This setting is obsolete.

</table>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em"><b>ncurses</b>
enabled buffered output during terminal initialization. This
was done (as in SVr4 curses) for performance reasons. For
testing purposes, both of <b>ncurses</b> and certain
applications, this feature was made optional. Setting the
NCURSES_NO_SETBUF variable disabled output buffering,
leaving the output in the original (usually line buffered)
mode.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">In the current
implementation, ncurses performs its own buffering and does
not require this workaround. It does not modify the
buffering of the standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">The reason for
the change was to make the behavior for interrupts and other
signals more robust. One drawback is that certain
nonconventional programs would mix ordinary stdio calls with
ncurses calls and (usually) work. This is no longer possible
since ncurses is not using the buffered standard output but
its own output (to the same file descriptor). As a special
case, the low-level calls such as <b>putp</b> still use the
standard output. But high-level curses calls do not.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">NCURSES_NO_UTF8_ACS</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">During initialization, the
<b>ncurses</b> library checks for special cases where VT100
line-drawing (and the corresponding alternate character set
capabilities) described in the terminfo are known to be
missing. Specifically, when running in a UTF&minus;8 locale,
the Linux console emulator and the GNU screen program ignore
these. Ncurses checks the TERM environment variable for
these. For other special cases, you should set this
environment variable. Doing this tells ncurses to use
Unicode values which correspond to the VT100 line-drawing
glyphs. That works for the special cases cited, and is
likely to work for terminal emulators.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">When setting
this variable, you should set it to a nonzero value. Setting
it to zero (or to a nonnumber) disables the special check
for &quot;linux&quot; and &quot;screen&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">As an
alternative to the environment variable, ncurses checks for
an extended terminfo capability <b>U8</b>. This is a numeric
capability which can be compiled using
<b>tic&nbsp;&minus;x</b>. For example</p>
<pre style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em"># linux console, if patched to provide working
# VT100 shift-in/shift-out, with corresponding font.
linux-vt100|linux console with VT100 line-graphics,
        U8#0, use=linux,


# uxterm with vt100Graphics resource set to false
xterm-utf8|xterm relying on UTF-8 line-graphics,
        U8#1, use=xterm,</pre>


<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">The name
&quot;U8&quot; is chosen to be two characters, to permit it
to be used by applications that use ncurses&rsquo; termcap
interface.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">NCURSES_TRACE</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">During initialization, the
<b>ncurses</b> debugging library checks the NCURSES_TRACE
environment variable. If it is defined, to a numeric value,
<b>ncurses</b> calls the <b>trace</b> function, using that
value as the argument.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">The argument
values, which are defined in <b>curses.h</b>, provide
several types of information. When running with traces
enabled, your application will write the file <b>trace</b>
to the current directory.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">TERMCAP</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">If the <b>ncurses</b> library
has been configured with <i>termcap</i> support,
<b>ncurses</b> will check for a terminal&rsquo;s description
in termcap form if it is not available in the terminfo
database.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">The TERMCAP
environment variable contains either a terminal description
(with newlines stripped out), or a file name telling where
the information denoted by the TERM environment variable
exists. In either case, setting it directs <b>ncurses</b> to
ignore the usual place for this information, e.g.,
/etc/termcap.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">TERMINFO</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Overrides the directory in
which <b>ncurses</b> searches for your terminal description.
This is the simplest, but not the only way to change the
list of directories. The complete list of directories in

<p style="margin-left:11%;">TERMINFO_DIRS</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Specifies a list of directories
to search for terminal descriptions. The list is separated
by colons (i.e., &quot;:&quot;) on Unix, semicolons on OS/2
EMX.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">All of the
terminal descriptions are in terminfo form. Normally these
are stored in a directory tree, using subdirectories named
by the first letter of the terminal names therein.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">If
<b>ncurses</b> is built with a hashed database, then each
entry in this list can also be the path of the corresponding
database file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">If
<b>ncurses</b> is built with a support for reading termcap
files directly, then an entry in this list may be the path
of a termcap file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">TERMPATH</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">If TERMCAP does not hold a file
name then <b>ncurses</b> checks the TERMPATH environment
variable. This is a list of filenames separated by spaces or
colons (i.e., &quot;:&quot;) on Unix, semicolons on OS/2
EMX.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">If the TERMPATH
environment variable is not set, <b>ncurses</b> looks in the
files /etc/termcap, /usr/share/misc/termcap and
$HOME/.termcap, in that order.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The library may
be configured to disregard the following variables when the
current user is the superuser (root), or if the application
uses setuid or setgid permissions:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">$TERMINFO,
$TERMINFO_DIRS, $TERMPATH, as well as $HOME.</p>

<h2>ALTERNATE CONFIGURATIONS
<a name="ALTERNATE CONFIGURATIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Several
different configurations are possible, depending on the
configure script options used when building <b>ncurses</b>.
There are a few main options whose effects are visible to
the applications developer using <b>ncurses</b>: <br>
&minus;&minus;disable&minus;overwrite</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The standard include for
<b>ncurses</b> is as noted in <b>SYNOPSIS</b>:</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em"><b>#include
&lt;curses.h&gt;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">This option is
used to avoid filename conflicts when <b>ncurses</b> is not
the main implementation of curses of the computer. If
<b>ncurses</b> is installed disabling overwrite, it puts its
headers in a subdirectory, e.g.,</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em"><b>#include
&lt;ncurses/curses.h&gt;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">It also omits a
symbolic link which would allow you to use
<b>&minus;lcurses</b> to build executables.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;">&minus;&minus;enable&minus;widec</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The configure script renames
the library and (if the
<b>&minus;&minus;disable&minus;overwrite</b> option is used)
puts the header files in a different subdirectory. All of
the library names have a &quot;w&quot; appended to them,
i.e., instead of</p>


<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;lncurses</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">you link
with</p>


<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;lncursesw</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">You must also
define <b>_XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED</b> when compiling for the
wide-character library to use the extended (wide-character)
functions. The <b>curses.h</b> file which is installed for
the wide-character library is designed to be compatible with
the normal library&rsquo;s header. Only the size of the
<b>WINDOW</b> structure differs, and very few applications
require more than a pointer to <b>WINDOW</b>s. If the
headers are installed allowing overwrite, the wide-character
library&rsquo;s headers should be installed last, to allow
applications to be built using either library from the same
set of headers.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;">&minus;&minus;with&minus;shared
<br>
&minus;&minus;with&minus;normal <br>
&minus;&minus;with&minus;debug <br>
&minus;&minus;with&minus;profile</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The shared and normal (static)
library names differ by their suffixes, e.g.,
<b>libncurses.so</b> and <b>libncurses.a</b>. The debug and
profiling libraries add a &quot;_g&quot; and a
&quot;_p&quot; to the root names respectively, e.g.,
<b>libncurses_g.a</b> and <b>libncurses_p.a</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;">&minus;&minus;with&minus;trace</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The <b>trace</b> function
normally resides in the debug library, but it is sometimes
useful to configure this in the shared library. Configure
scripts should check for the function&rsquo;s existence
rather than assuming it is always in the debug library.</p>

<h2>FILES

<h2>EXTENSIONS
<a name="EXTENSIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>ncurses</b> library can be compiled with an option
(<b>&minus;DUSE_GETCAP</b>) that falls back to the old-style
/etc/termcap file if the terminal setup code cannot find a
terminfo entry corresponding to <b>TERM</b>. Use of this
feature is not recommended, as it essentially includes an
entire termcap compiler in the <b>ncurses</b> startup code,
at significant cost in core and startup cycles.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>ncurses</b> library includes facilities for capturing
mouse events on certain terminals (including xterm). See the
<b>curs_mouse</b>(3X) manual page for details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>ncurses</b> library includes facilities for responding to
window resizing events, e.g., when running in an xterm. See
the <b>resizeterm</b>(3X) and <b>wresize</b>(3X) manual
pages for details. In addition, the library may be
configured with a SIGWINCH handler.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>ncurses</b> library extends the fixed set of function key
capabilities of terminals by allowing the application
designer to define additional key sequences at runtime. See
the <b>define_key</b>(3X) <b>key_defined</b>(3X), and
<b>keyok</b>(3X) manual pages for details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>ncurses</b> library can exploit the capabilities of
terminals which implement the ISO&minus;6429 SGR 39 and SGR
49 controls, which allow an application to reset the
terminal to its original foreground and background colors.
From the users&rsquo; perspective, the application is able
to draw colored text on a background whose color is set
independently, providing better control over color
contrasts. See the <b>default_colors</b>(3X) manual page for
details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>ncurses</b> library includes a function for directing
application output to a printer attached to the terminal
device. See the <b>curs_print</b>(3X) manual page for
details.</p>

<h2>PORTABILITY
<a name="PORTABILITY"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>ncurses</b> library is intended to be BASE-level
conformant with XSI Curses. The EXTENDED XSI Curses
functionality (including color support) is supported.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A small number
of local differences (that is, individual differences
between the XSI Curses and <b>ncurses</b> calls) are
described in <b>PORTABILITY</b> sections of the library man
pages.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Unlike other
implementations, this one checks parameters such as pointers
to WINDOW structures to ensure they are not null. The main
reason for providing this behavior is to guard against
programmer error. The standard interface does not provide a
way for the library to tell an application which of several
possible errors were detected. Relying on this (or some
other) extension will adversely affect the portability of
curses applications.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This
implementation also contains several extensions:</p>
