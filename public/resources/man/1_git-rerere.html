<h2>NAME
<a name="NAME"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">git-rerere
&minus; Reuse recorded resolution of conflicted merges</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>git
rerere</i> [<i>clear</i>|<i>forget</i>
&lt;pathspec&gt;|<i>diff</i>|<i>remaining</i>|<i>status</i>|<i>gc</i>]</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In a workflow
employing relatively long lived topic branches, the
developer sometimes needs to resolve the same conflicts over
and over again until the topic branches are done (either
merged to the &quot;release&quot; branch, or sent out and
accepted upstream).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This command
assists the developer in this process by recording
conflicted automerge results and corresponding hand resolve
results on the initial manual merge, and applying previously
recorded hand resolutions to their corresponding automerge
results.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><b><big>Note</big></b>
<br>
You need to set the configuration variable rerere.enabled in
order to enable this command.</p>

<h2>COMMANDS
<a name="COMMANDS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>Normally,
<i>git rerere</i> is run without arguments or
user&minus;intervention. However, it has several commands
that allow it to interact with its working state.</big></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big><i>clear</i></big></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><big>Reset the metadata used by
rerere if a merge resolution is to be aborted. Calling
<i>git am [&minus;&minus;skip|&minus;&minus;abort]</i> or
<i>git rebase [&minus;&minus;skip|&minus;&minus;abort]</i>
will automatically invoke this command.</big></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big><i>forget</i>
&lt;pathspec&gt;</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><big>Reset the conflict
resolutions which rerere has recorded for the current
conflict in &lt;pathspec&gt;.</big></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big><i>diff</i></big></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><big>Display diffs for the
current state of the resolution. It is useful for tracking
what has changed while the user is resolving conflicts.
Additional arguments are passed directly to the system
<i>diff</i> command installed in PATH.</big></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big><i>status</i></big></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><big>Print paths with conflicts
whose merge resolution rerere will record.</big></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big><i>remaining</i></big></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><big>Print paths with conflicts
that have not been autoresolved by rerere. This includes
paths whose resolutions cannot be tracked by rerere, such as
conflicting submodules.</big></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big><i>gc</i></big></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><big>Prune records of
conflicted merges that occurred a long time ago. By default,
unresolved conflicts older than 15 days and resolved
conflicts older than 60 days are pruned. These defaults are
controlled via the gc.rerereunresolved and gc.rerereresolved
configuration variables respectively.</big></p>

<h2>DISCUSSION
<a name="DISCUSSION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>When your
topic branch modifies an overlapping area that your master
branch (or upstream) touched since your topic branch forked
from it, you may want to test it with the latest master,
even before your topic branch is ready to be pushed
upstream:</big></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><big>o&minus;&minus;&minus;*&minus;&minus;&minus;o
topic <br>
/ <br>

o&minus;&minus;&minus;o&minus;&minus;&minus;o&minus;&minus;&minus;*&minus;&minus;&minus;o&minus;&minus;&minus;o
master</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>For such a
test, you need to merge master and topic somehow. One way to
do it is to pull master into the topic branch:</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><big>$ git
checkout topic <br>
$ git merge master</big></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><big>o&minus;&minus;&minus;*&minus;&minus;&minus;o&minus;&minus;&minus;+
topic <br>
/ / <br>

o&minus;&minus;&minus;o&minus;&minus;&minus;o&minus;&minus;&minus;*&minus;&minus;&minus;o&minus;&minus;&minus;o
master</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>The
commits marked with * touch the same area in the same file;
you need to resolve the conflicts when creating the commit
marked with +. Then you can test the result to make sure
your work&minus;in&minus;progress still works with what is
in the latest master.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>After this
test merge, there are two ways to continue your work on the
topic. The easiest is to build on top of the test merge
commit +, and when your work in the topic branch is finally
ready, pull the topic branch into master, and/or ask the
upstream to pull from you. By that time, however, the master
or the upstream might have been advanced since the test
merge +, in which case the final commit graph would look
like this:</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><big>$ git
checkout topic <br>
$ git merge master <br>
$ ... work on both topic and master branches <br>
$ git checkout master <br>
$ git merge topic</big></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><big>o&minus;&minus;&minus;*&minus;&minus;&minus;o&minus;&minus;&minus;+&minus;&minus;&minus;o&minus;&minus;&minus;o
topic <br>
/ / \ <br>

o&minus;&minus;&minus;o&minus;&minus;&minus;o&minus;&minus;&minus;*&minus;&minus;&minus;o&minus;&minus;&minus;o&minus;&minus;&minus;o&minus;&minus;&minus;o&minus;&minus;&minus;+
master</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>When your
topic branch is long&minus;lived, however, your topic branch
would end up having many such &quot;Merge from master&quot;
commits on it, which would unnecessarily clutter the
development history. Readers of the Linux kernel mailing
list may remember that Linus complained about such too
frequent test merges when a subsystem maintainer asked to
pull from a branch full of &quot;useless
merges&quot;.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>As an
alternative, to keep the topic branch clean of test merges,
you could blow away the test merge, and keep building on top
of the tip before the test merge:</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><big>$ git
checkout topic <br>
$ git merge master <br>
$ git reset &minus;&minus;hard HEAD^ ;# rewind the test
merge <br>
$ ... work on both topic and master branches <br>
$ git checkout master <br>
$ git merge topic</big></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><big>o&minus;&minus;&minus;*&minus;&minus;&minus;o&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;o&minus;&minus;&minus;o
topic <br>
/ \ <br>

o&minus;&minus;&minus;o&minus;&minus;&minus;o&minus;&minus;&minus;*&minus;&minus;&minus;o&minus;&minus;&minus;o&minus;&minus;&minus;o&minus;&minus;&minus;o&minus;&minus;&minus;+
master</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>This would
leave only one merge commit when your topic branch is
finally ready and merged into the master branch. This merge
would require you to resolve the conflict, introduced by the
commits marked with *. However, this conflict is often the
same conflict you resolved when you created the test merge
you blew away. <i>git rerere</i> helps you resolve this
final conflicted merge using the information from your
earlier hand resolve.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>Running
the <i>git rerere</i> command immediately after a conflicted
automerge records the conflicted working tree files, with
the usual conflict markers &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;,
=======, and &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in them. Later,
after you are done resolving the conflicts, running <i>git
rerere</i> again will record the resolved state of these
files. Suppose you did this when you created the test merge
of master into the topic branch.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>Next time,
after seeing the same conflicted automerge, running <i>git
rerere</i> will perform a three&minus;way merge between the
earlier conflicted automerge, the earlier manual resolution,
and the current conflicted automerge. If this
three&minus;way merge resolves cleanly, the result is
written out to your working tree file, so you do not have to
manually resolve it. Note that <i>git rerere</i> leaves the
index file alone, so you still need to do the final sanity
checks with git diff (or git diff &minus;c) and <i>git
add</i> when you are satisfied.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>As a
convenience measure, <i>git merge</i> automatically invokes
<i>git rerere</i> upon exiting with a failed automerge and
<i>git rerere</i> records the hand resolve when it is a new
conflict, or reuses the earlier hand resolve when it is not.
<i>git commit</i> also invokes <i>git rerere</i> when
committing a merge result. What this means is that you do
not have to do anything special yourself (besides enabling
the rerere.enabled config variable).</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>In our
example, when you do the test merge, the manual resolution
is recorded, and it will be reused when you do the actual
merge later with the updated master and topic branch, as
long as the recorded resolution is still
applicable.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>The
information <i>git rerere</i> records is also used when
running <i>git rebase</i>. After blowing away the test merge
and continuing development on the topic branch:</big></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><big>o&minus;&minus;&minus;*&minus;&minus;&minus;o&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;o&minus;&minus;&minus;o
topic <br>
/ <br>

o&minus;&minus;&minus;o&minus;&minus;&minus;o&minus;&minus;&minus;*&minus;&minus;&minus;o&minus;&minus;&minus;o&minus;&minus;&minus;o&minus;&minus;&minus;o
master</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><big>$ git
rebase master topic</big></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><big>o&minus;&minus;&minus;*&minus;&minus;&minus;o&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;o&minus;&minus;&minus;o
topic <br>
/ <br>

o&minus;&minus;&minus;o&minus;&minus;&minus;o&minus;&minus;&minus;*&minus;&minus;&minus;o&minus;&minus;&minus;o&minus;&minus;&minus;o&minus;&minus;&minus;o
master</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>you could
run git rebase master topic, to bring yourself
up&minus;to&minus;date before your topic is ready to be sent
upstream. This would result in falling back to a
three&minus;way merge, and it would conflict the same way as
the test merge you resolved earlier. <i>git rerere</i> will
be run by <i>git rebase</i> to help you resolve this
conflict.</big></p>
