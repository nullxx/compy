&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>sigtimedwait</i>() function shall be equivalent to
<i>sigwaitinfo</i>() except that if none of the signals
specified by <i>set</i> are pending, <i>sigtimedwait</i>()
shall wait for the time interval specified in the
<b>timespec</b> structure referenced by <i>timeout</i>. If
the <b>timespec</b> structure pointed to by <i>timeout</i>
is zero-valued and if none of the signals specified by
<i>set</i> are pending, then <i>sigtimedwait</i>() shall
return immediately with an error. If <i>timeout</i> is the
NULL pointer, the behavior is unspecified. If the Monotonic
Clock option is supported, the CLOCK_MONOTONIC clock shall
be used to measure the time interval specified by the
<i>timeout</i> argument.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>sigwaitinfo</i>() function selects the pending signal
from the set specified by <i>set</i>. Should any of multiple
pending signals in the range SIGRTMIN to SIGRTMAX be
selected, it shall be the lowest numbered one. The selection
order between realtime and non-realtime signals, or between
multiple pending non-realtime signals, is unspecified. If no
signal in <i>set</i> is pending at the time of the call, the
calling thread shall be suspended until one or more signals
in <i>set</i> become pending or until it is interrupted by
an unblocked, caught signal.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>sigwaitinfo</i>() function shall be equivalent to the
<i>sigwait</i>() function if the <i>info</i> argument is
NULL. If the <i>info</i> argument is non-NULL, the
<i>sigwaitinfo</i>() function shall be equivalent to
<i>sigwait</i>(), except that the selected signal number
shall be stored in the <i>si_signo</i> member, and the cause
of the signal shall be stored in the <i>si_code</i> member.
If any value is queued to the selected signal, the first
such queued value shall be dequeued and, if the <i>info</i>
argument is non-NULL, the value shall be stored in the
<i>si_value</i> member of <i>info</i>. The system resource
used to queue the signal shall be released and returned to
the system for other use. If no value is queued, the content
of the <i>si_value</i> member is undefined. If no further
signals are queued for the selected signal, the pending
indication for that signal shall be reset.</p>

<h2>RETURN VALUE
<a name="RETURN VALUE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Upon successful
completion (that is, one of the signals specified by
<i>set</i> is pending or is generated) <i>sigwaitinfo</i>()
and <i>sigtimedwait</i>() shall return the selected signal
number. Otherwise, the function shall return a value of -1
and set <i>errno</i> to indicate the error.</p>

<h2>ERRORS

following sections are informative.</i></p>

<h2>EXAMPLES
<a name="EXAMPLES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">None.</p>

<h2>APPLICATION USAGE
<a name="APPLICATION USAGE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>sigtimedwait</i>() function times out and returns an
[EAGAIN] error. Application writers should note that this is
inconsistent with other functions such as
<i>pthread_cond_timedwait</i>() that return [ETIMEDOUT].</p>

<h2>RATIONALE
<a name="RATIONALE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Existing
programming practice on realtime systems uses the ability to
pause waiting for a selected set of events and handle the
first event that occurs in-line instead of in a
signal-handling function. This allows applications to be
written in an event-directed style similar to a state
machine. This style of programming is useful for largescale
transaction processing in which the overall throughput of an
application and the ability to clearly track states are more
important than the ability to minimize the response time of
individual event handling.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is possible
to construct a signal-waiting macro function out of the
realtime signal function mechanism defined in this volume of
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001. However, such a macro has to
include the definition of a generalized handler for all
signals to be waited on. A significant portion of the
overhead of handler processing can be avoided if the
signal-waiting function is provided by the kernel. This
volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 therefore provides
two signal-waiting functions-one that waits indefinitely and
one with a timeout-as part of the overall realtime signal
function specification.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
specification of a function with a timeout allows an
application to be written that can be broken out of a wait
after a set period of time if no event has occurred. It was
argued that setting a timer event before the wait and
recognizing the timer event in the wait would also implement
the same functionality, but at a lower performance level.
Because of the performance degradation associated with the
user-level specification of a timer event and the subsequent
cancellation of that timer event after the wait completes
for a valid event, and the complexity associated with
handling potential race conditions associated with the
user-level method, the separate function has been
included.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that the
semantics of the <i>sigwaitinfo</i>() function are nearly
identical to that of the <i>sigwait</i>() function defined
by this volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001. The only
difference is that <i>sigwaitinfo</i>() returns the queued
signal value in the <i>value</i> argument. The return of the
queued value is required so that applications can
differentiate between multiple events queued to the same
signal number.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The two
distinct functions are being maintained because some
implementations may choose to implement the POSIX Threads
Extension functions and not implement the queued signals
extensions. Note, though, that <i>sigwaitinfo</i>() does not
return the queued value if the <i>value</i> argument is
NULL, so the POSIX Threads Extension <i>sigwait</i>()
function can be implemented as a macro on
<i>sigwaitinfo</i>().</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>sigtimedwait</i>() function was separated from the
<i>sigwaitinfo</i>() function to address concerns regarding
the overloading of the <i>timeout</i> pointer to indicate
indefinite wait (no timeout), timed wait, and immediate
return, and concerns regarding consistency with other
functions where the conditional and timed waits were
separate functions from the pure blocking function. The
semantics of <i>sigtimedwait</i>() are specified such that
<i>sigwaitinfo</i>() could be implemented as a macro with a
NULL pointer for <i>timeout</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>sigwait</i> functions provide a synchronous mechanism for
threads to wait for asynchronously-generated signals. One
important question was how many threads that are suspended
in a call to a <i>sigwait</i>() function for a signal should
return from the call when the signal is sent. Four choices
were considered:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="12%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">1.</p></td>
<td width="2%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">Return an error for multiple
simultaneous calls to <i>sigwait</i> functions for the same
signal.</p> </td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="12%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p>2.</p></td>
<td width="2%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>One or more threads return.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="12%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p>3.</p></td>
<td width="2%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>All waiting threads return.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="12%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p>4.</p></td>
<td width="2%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>Exactly one thread returns.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Prohibiting
multiple calls to <i>sigwait</i>() for the same signal was
felt to be overly restrictive. The &quot;one or more&quot;
behavior made implementation of conforming packages easy at
the expense of forcing POSIX threads clients to protect
against multiple simultaneous calls to <i>sigwait</i>() in
application code in order to achieve predictable behavior.
There was concern that the &quot;all waiting threads&quot;
behavior would result in &quot;signal broadcast
storms&quot;, consuming excessive CPU resources by
replicating the signals in the general case. Furthermore, no
convincing examples could be presented that delivery to all
was either simpler or more powerful than delivery to
one.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Thus, the
consensus was that exactly one thread that was suspended in
a call to a <i>sigwait</i> function for a signal should
return when that signal occurs. This is not an onerous
restriction as:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="12%"></td>
<td width="2%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">*</p></td>
<td width="1%"></td>
<td width="85%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">A multi-way signal wait can be
built from the single-way wait.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="12%"></td>
<td width="2%">


<p>*</p></td>
<td width="1%"></td>
<td width="85%">


<p>Signals should only be handled by application-level
code, as library routines cannot guess what the application
wants to do with signals generated for the entire
process.</p> </td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="12%"></td>
<td width="2%">


<p>*</p></td>
<td width="1%"></td>
<td width="85%">


<p>Applications can thus arrange for a single thread to
wait for any given signal and call any needed routines upon
its arrival.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In an
application that is using signals for interprocess
communication, signal processing is typically done in one
place. Alternatively, if the signal is being caught so that
process cleanup can be done, the signal handler thread can
call separate process cleanup routines for each portion of
the application. Since the application main line started
each portion of the application, it is at the right
abstraction level to tell each portion of the application to
clean up.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Certainly,
there exist programming styles where it is logical to
consider waiting for a single signal in multiple threads. A
simple <i>sigwait_multiple</i>() routine can be constructed
to achieve this goal. A possible implementation would be to
have each <i>sigwait_multiple</i>() caller registered as
having expressed interest in a set of signals. The caller
then waits on a thread-specific condition variable. A single
server thread calls a <i>sigwait</i>() function on the union
of all registered signals. When the <i>sigwait</i>()
function returns, the appropriate state is set and condition
variables are broadcast. New <i>sigwait_multiple</i>()
callers may cause the pending <i>sigwait</i>() call to be
canceled and reissued in order to update the set of signals
being waited for.</p>
