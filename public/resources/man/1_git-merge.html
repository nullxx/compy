<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">git-merge
&minus; Join two or more development histories together</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>git
merge</i> [&minus;n] [&minus;&minus;stat]
[&minus;&minus;no&minus;commit] [&minus;&minus;squash]
[&minus;&minus;[no&minus;]edit] <br>
[&minus;s &lt;strategy&gt;] [&minus;X

&lt;msg&gt;] [&lt;commit&gt;...] <i><br>
git merge</i> &lt;msg&gt; HEAD &lt;commit&gt;... <i><br>
git merge</i> &minus;&minus;abort</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Incorporates
changes from the named commits (since the time their
histories diverged from the current branch) into the current
branch. This command is used by <i>git pull</i> to
incorporate changes from another repository and can be used
by hand to merge changes from one branch into another.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Assume the
following history exists and the current branch is
&quot;master&quot;:</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">A&minus;&minus;&minus;B&minus;&minus;&minus;C
topic <br>
/ <br>

D&minus;&minus;&minus;E&minus;&minus;&minus;F&minus;&minus;&minus;G
master</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Then &quot;git
merge topic&quot; will replay the changes made on the topic
branch since it diverged from master (i.e., E) until its
current commit (C) on top of master, and record the result
in a new commit along with the names of the two parent
commits and a log message from the user describing the
changes.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">A&minus;&minus;&minus;B&minus;&minus;&minus;C
topic <br>
/ \ <br>

D&minus;&minus;&minus;E&minus;&minus;&minus;F&minus;&minus;&minus;G&minus;&minus;&minus;H
master</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The second
syntax (&lt;msg&gt; HEAD &lt;commit&gt;...) is supported for
historical reasons. Do not use it from the command line or
in new scripts. It is the same as git merge &minus;m
&lt;msg&gt; &lt;commit&gt;....</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The third
syntax (&quot;git merge &minus;&minus;abort&quot;) can only
be run after the merge has resulted in conflicts. <i>git
merge &minus;&minus;abort</i> will abort the merge process
and try to reconstruct the pre&minus;merge state. However,
if there were uncommitted changes when the merge started
(and especially if those changes were further modified after
the merge was started), <i>git merge &minus;&minus;abort</i>
will in some cases be unable to reconstruct the original
(pre&minus;merge) changes. Therefore:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Warning</b>:
Running <i>git merge</i> with uncommitted changes is
discouraged: while possible, it leaves you in a state that
is hard to back out of in the case of a conflict.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;commit,
&minus;&minus;no&minus;commit</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Perform the merge and commit
the result. This option can be used to override
&minus;&minus;no&minus;commit.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">With
&minus;&minus;no&minus;commit perform the merge but pretend
the merge failed and do not autocommit, to give the user a
chance to inspect and further tweak the merge result before
committing.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;edit,
&minus;&minus;no&minus;edit</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Invoke an editor before
committing successful mechanical merge to further edit the
auto&minus;generated merge message, so that the user can
explain and justify the merge. The
&minus;&minus;no&minus;edit option can be used to accept the
auto&minus;generated message (this is generally
discouraged). The &minus;&minus;edit option is still useful
if you are giving a draft message with the &minus;m option
from the command line and want to edit it in the editor.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Older scripts
may depend on the historical behaviour of not allowing the
user to edit the merge log message. They will see an editor
opened when they run git merge. To make it easier to adjust
such scripts to the updated behaviour, the environment
variable GIT_MERGE_AUTOEDIT can be set to no at the
beginning of them.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;ff</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When the merge resolves as a
fast&minus;forward, only update the branch pointer, without
creating a merge commit. This is the default behavior.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;no&minus;ff</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Create a merge commit even when
the merge resolves as a fast&minus;forward. This is the
default behaviour when merging an annotated (and possibly
signed) tag.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;ff&minus;only</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Refuse to merge and exit with a
non&minus;zero status unless the current HEAD is already
up&minus;to&minus;date or the merge can be resolved as a
fast&minus;forward.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;log[=&lt;n&gt;],
&minus;&minus;no&minus;log</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">In addition to branch names,
populate the log message with one&minus;line descriptions
from at most &lt;n&gt; actual commits that are being merged.
See also <b>git-fmt-merge-msg</b>(1).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">With
&minus;&minus;no&minus;log do not list one&minus;line
descriptions from the actual commits being merged.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;stat,
&minus;n, &minus;&minus;no&minus;stat</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Show a diffstat at the end of
the merge. The diffstat is also controlled by the
configuration option merge.stat.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">With &minus;n
or &minus;&minus;no&minus;stat do not show a diffstat at the
end of the merge.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;squash,
&minus;&minus;no&minus;squash</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Produce the working tree and
index state as if a real merge happened (except for the
merge information), but do not actually make a commit or
move the HEAD, nor record $GIT_DIR/MERGE_HEAD to cause the
next git commit command to create a merge commit. This
allows you to create a single commit on top of the current
branch whose effect is the same as merging another branch
(or more in case of an octopus).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">With
&minus;&minus;no&minus;squash perform the merge and commit
the result. This option can be used to override
&minus;&minus;squash.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;s
&lt;strategy&gt;,
&minus;&minus;strategy=&lt;strategy&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Use the given merge strategy;
can be supplied more than once to specify them in the order
they should be tried. If there is no &minus;s option, a
built&minus;in list of strategies is used instead (<i>git
merge&minus;recursive</i> when merging a single head, <i>git
merge&minus;octopus</i> otherwise).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;X
&lt;option&gt;,
&minus;&minus;strategy&minus;option=&lt;option&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Pass merge strategy specific
option through to the merge strategy.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;verify&minus;signatures,
&minus;&minus;no&minus;verify&minus;signatures</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Verify that the commits being
merged have good and trusted GPG signatures and abort the
merge in case they do not.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;summary,
&minus;&minus;no&minus;summary</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Synonyms to &minus;&minus;stat
and &minus;&minus;no&minus;stat; these are deprecated and
will be removed in the future.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;q,
&minus;&minus;quiet</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Operate quietly. Implies
&minus;&minus;no&minus;progress.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;v,
&minus;&minus;verbose</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Be verbose.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;progress,
&minus;&minus;no&minus;progress</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Turn progress on/off
explicitly. If neither is specified, progress is shown if
standard error is connected to a terminal. Note that not all
merge strategies may support progress reporting.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;m
&lt;msg&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Set the commit message to be
used for the merge commit (in case one is created).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If
&minus;&minus;log is specified, a shortlog of the commits
being merged will be appended to the specified message.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The <i>git
fmt&minus;merge&minus;msg</i> command can be used to give a
good default for automated <i>git merge</i> invocations.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;[no&minus;]rerere&minus;autoupdate</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Allow the rerere mechanism to
update the index with the result of auto&minus;conflict
resolution if possible.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;abort</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Abort the current conflict
resolution process, and try to reconstruct the
pre&minus;merge state.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If there were
uncommitted worktree changes present when the merge started,
<i>git merge &minus;&minus;abort</i> will in some cases be
unable to reconstruct these changes. It is therefore
recommended to always commit or stash your changes before
running <i>git merge</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><i>git merge
&minus;&minus;abort</i> is equivalent to <i>git reset
&minus;&minus;merge</i> when MERGE_HEAD is present.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&lt;commit&gt;...</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Commits, usually other branch
heads, to merge into our branch. Specifying more than one
commit will create a merge with more than two parents
(affectionately called an Octopus merge).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If no commit is
given from the command line, and if merge.defaultToUpstream
configuration variable is set, merge the
remote&minus;tracking branches that the current branch is
configured to use as its upstream. See also the
configuration section of this manual page.</p>

<h2>PRE-MERGE CHECKS
<a name="PRE-MERGE CHECKS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Before applying
outside changes, you should get your own work in good shape
and committed locally, so it will not be clobbered if there
are conflicts. See also <b>git-stash</b>(1). <i>git pull</i>
and <i>git merge</i> will stop without doing anything when
local uncommitted changes overlap with files that <i>git
pull</i>/<i>git merge</i> may need to update.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To avoid
recording unrelated changes in the merge commit, <i>git
pull</i> and <i>git merge</i> will also abort if there are
any changes registered in the index relative to the HEAD
commit. (One exception is when the changed index entries are
in the state that would result from the merge already.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If all named
commits are already ancestors of HEAD, <i>git merge</i> will
exit early with the message &quot;Already
up&minus;to&minus;date.&quot;</p>

<h2>FAST-FORWARD MERGE
<a name="FAST-FORWARD MERGE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Often the
current branch head is an ancestor of the named commit. This
is the most common case especially when invoked from <i>git
pull</i>: you are tracking an upstream repository, you have
committed no local changes, and now you want to update to a
newer upstream revision. In this case, a new commit is not
needed to store the combined history; instead, the HEAD
(along with the index) is updated to point at the named
commit, without creating an extra merge commit.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This behavior
can be suppressed with the &minus;&minus;no&minus;ff
option.</p>

<h2>TRUE MERGE
<a name="TRUE MERGE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Except in a
fast&minus;forward merge (see above), the branches to be
merged must be tied together by a merge commit that has both
of them as its parents.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A merged
version reconciling the changes from all branches to be
merged is committed, and your HEAD, index, and working tree
are updated to it. It is possible to have modifications in
the working tree as long as they do not overlap; the update
will preserve them.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When it is not
obvious how to reconcile the changes, the following
happens:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">1. The HEAD
pointer stays the same.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">2. The
MERGE_HEAD ref is set to point to the other branch head.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">3. Paths that
merged cleanly are updated both in the index file and in
your working tree.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">4. For
conflicting paths, the index file records up to three
versions: stage 1 stores the version from the common
ancestor, stage 2 from HEAD, and stage 3 from MERGE_HEAD
(you can inspect the stages with git ls&minus;files
&minus;u). The working tree files contain the result of the
&quot;merge&quot; program; i.e. 3&minus;way merge results
with familiar conflict markers
&lt;&lt;&lt;===&gt;&gt;&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">5. No other
changes are made. In particular, the local modifications you
had before you started merge will stay the same and the
index entries for them stay as they were, i.e. matching
HEAD.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you tried a
merge which resulted in complex conflicts and want to start
over, you can recover with git merge
&minus;&minus;abort.</p>

<h2>MERGING TAG
<a name="MERGING TAG"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When merging an
annotated (and possibly signed) tag, Git always creates a
merge commit even if a fast&minus;forward merge is possible,
and the commit message template is prepared with the tag
message. Additionally, if the tag is signed, the signature
check is reported as a comment in the message template. See
also <b>git-tag</b>(1).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When you want
to just integrate with the work leading to the commit that
happens to be tagged, e.g. synchronizing with an upstream
release point, you may not want to make an unnecessary merge
commit.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In such a case,
you can &quot;unwrap&quot; the tag yourself before feeding
it to git merge, or pass &minus;&minus;ff&minus;only when
you do not have any work on your own. e.g.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;&minus;
git fetch origin git merge v1.2.3^0 git merge
&minus;&minus;ff&minus;only v1.2.3 &minus;&minus;&minus;</p>

<h2>HOW CONFLICTS ARE PRESENTED
<a name="HOW CONFLICTS ARE PRESENTED"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">During a merge,
the working tree files are updated to reflect the result of
the merge. Among the changes made to the common
ancestor&rsquo;s version, non&minus;overlapping ones (that
is, you changed an area of the file while the other side
left that area intact, or vice versa) are incorporated in
the final result verbatim. When both sides made changes to
the same area, however, Git cannot randomly pick one side
over the other, and asks you to resolve it by leaving what
both sides did to that area.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">By default, Git
uses the same style as the one used by the &quot;merge&quot;
program from the RCS suite to present such a conflicted
hunk, like this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Here are lines
that are either unchanged from the common <br>
ancestor, or cleanly resolved because only one side changed.
<br>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; yours:sample.txt <br>
Conflict resolution is hard; <br>
let's go shopping. <br>
======= <br>
Git makes conflict resolution easy. <br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; theirs:sample.txt <br>
And here is another line that is cleanly resolved or
unmodified.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The area where
a pair of conflicting changes happened is marked with
markers &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;, =======, and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;. The part before the ======= is
typically your side, and the part afterwards is typically
their side.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The default
format does not show what the original said in the
conflicting area. You cannot tell how many lines are deleted
and replaced with Barbie&rsquo;s remark on your side. The
only thing you can tell is that your side wants to say it is
hard and you&rsquo;d prefer to go shopping, while the other
side wants to claim it is easy.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">An alternative
style can be used by setting the
&quot;merge.conflictstyle&quot; configuration variable to
&quot;diff3&quot;. In &quot;diff3&quot; style, the above
conflict may look like this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Here are lines
that are either unchanged from the common <br>
ancestor, or cleanly resolved because only one side changed.
<br>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; yours:sample.txt <br>
Conflict resolution is hard; <br>
let's go shopping. <br>
||||||| <br>
Conflict resolution is hard. <br>
======= <br>
Git makes conflict resolution easy. <br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; theirs:sample.txt <br>
And here is another line that is cleanly resolved or
unmodified.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In addition to
the &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;, =======, and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; markers, it uses another
||||||| marker that is followed by the original text. You
can tell that the original just stated a fact, and your side
simply gave in to that statement and gave up, while the
other side tried to have a more positive attitude. You can
sometimes come up with a better resolution by viewing the
original.</p>

<h2>HOW TO RESOLVE CONFLICTS
<a name="HOW TO RESOLVE CONFLICTS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">After seeing a
conflict, you can do two things:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; Decide
not to merge. The only clean&minus;ups you need are to reset
the index file to the HEAD commit to reverse 2. and to clean
up working tree changes made by 2. and 3.; git merge
&minus;&minus;abort can be used for this.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; Resolve
the conflicts. Git will mark the conflicts in the working
tree. Edit the files into shape and <i>git add</i> them to
the index. Use <i>git commit</i> to seal the deal.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can work
through the conflict with a number of tools:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; Use a
mergetool. git mergetool to launch a graphical mergetool
which will work you through the merge.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; Look at
the diffs. git diff will show a three&minus;way diff,
highlighting changes from both the HEAD and MERGE_HEAD
versions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; Look at
the diffs from each branch. git log &minus;&minus;merge
&minus;p &lt;path&gt; will show diffs first for the HEAD
version and then the MERGE_HEAD version.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; Look at
the originals. git show :1:filename shows the common
ancestor, git show :2:filename shows the HEAD version, and
git show :3:filename shows the MERGE_HEAD version.</p>

<h2>EXAMPLES
<a name="EXAMPLES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; Merge
branches fixes and enhancements on top of the current
branch, making an octopus merge:</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">$ git merge
fixes enhancements</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; Merge
branch obsolete into the current branch, using ours merge
strategy:</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">$ git merge
&minus;s ours obsolete</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; Merge
branch maint into the current branch, but do not make a new
commit automatically:</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">$ git merge
&minus;&minus;no&minus;commit maint</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This can be
used when you want to include further changes to the merge,
or want to write your own merge commit message.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">You should
refrain from abusing this option to sneak substantial
changes into a merge commit. Small fixups like bumping
release/version name would be acceptable.</p>

<h2>MERGE STRATEGIES
<a name="MERGE STRATEGIES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The merge
mechanism (<i>git&minus;merge</i> and <i>git&minus;pull</i>
commands) allows the backend <i>merge strategies</i> to be
chosen with &minus;s option. Some strategies can also take
their own options, which can be passed by giving
&minus;X&lt;option&gt; arguments to <i>git&minus;merge</i>
and/or <i>git&minus;pull</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">resolve</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This can only resolve two heads
(i.e. the current branch and another branch you pulled from)
using a 3&minus;way merge algorithm. It tries to carefully
detect criss&minus;cross merge ambiguities and is considered
generally safe and fast.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">recursive</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This can only resolve two heads
using a 3&minus;way merge algorithm. When there is more than
one common ancestor that can be used for 3&minus;way merge,
it creates a merged tree of the common ancestors and uses
that as the reference tree for the 3&minus;way merge. This
has been reported to result in fewer merge conflicts without
causing mis&minus;merges by tests done on actual merge
commits taken from Linux 2.6 kernel development history.
Additionally this can detect and handle merges involving
renames. This is the default merge strategy when pulling or
merging one branch.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>recursive</i> strategy can take the following
options:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">ours</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">This option forces conflicting
hunks to be auto&minus;resolved cleanly by favoring
<i>our</i> version. Changes from the other tree that do not
conflict with our side are reflected to the merge result.
For a binary file, the entire contents are taken from our
side.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">This should not
be confused with the <i>ours</i> merge strategy, which does
not even look at what the other tree contains at all. It
discards everything the other tree did, declaring <i>our</i>
history contains all that happened in it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">theirs</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">This is the opposite of
<i>ours</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">patience</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">With this option,
<i>merge&minus;recursive</i> spends a little extra time to
avoid mismerges that sometimes occur due to unimportant
matching lines (e.g., braces from distinct functions). Use
this when the branches to be merged have diverged wildly.
See also <b>git-diff</b>(1)&minus;&minus;patience.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">diff&minus;algorithm=[patience|minimal|histogram|myers]</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">Tells
<i>merge&minus;recursive</i> to use a different diff
algorithm, which can help avoid mismerges that occur due to
unimportant matching lines (such as braces from distinct
functions). See also
<b>git-diff</b>(1)&minus;&minus;diff&minus;algorithm.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">ignore&minus;space&minus;change,
ignore&minus;all&minus;space,
ignore&minus;space&minus;at&minus;eol</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">Treats lines with the indicated
type of whitespace change as unchanged for the sake of a
three&minus;way merge. Whitespace changes mixed with other
changes to a line are not ignored. See also
<b>git-diff</b>(1)&minus;b, &minus;w, and
&minus;&minus;ignore&minus;space&minus;at&minus;eol.</p>

<p style="margin-left:29%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; If
<i>their</i> version only introduces whitespace changes to a
line, <i>our</i> version is used;</p>

<p style="margin-left:29%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; If
<i>our</i> version introduces whitespace changes but
<i>their</i> version includes a substantial change,
<i>their</i> version is used;</p>

<p style="margin-left:29%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
Otherwise, the merge proceeds in the usual way.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">renormalize</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">This runs a virtual
check&minus;out and check&minus;in of all three stages of a
file when resolving a three&minus;way merge. This option is
meant to be used when merging branches with different clean
filters or end&minus;of&minus;line normalization rules. See
&quot;Merging branches with differing checkin/checkout
attributes&quot; in <b>gitattributes</b>(5) for details.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">no&minus;renormalize</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">Disables the renormalize
option. This overrides the merge.renormalize configuration
variable.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">rename&minus;threshold=&lt;n&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">Controls the similarity
threshold used for rename detection. See also
<b>git-diff</b>(1)&minus;M.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">subtree[=&lt;path&gt;]</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">This option is a more advanced
form of <i>subtree</i> strategy, where the strategy makes a
guess on how two trees must be shifted to match with each
other when merging. Instead, the specified path is prefixed
(or stripped from the beginning) to make the shape of two
trees to match.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">octopus</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This resolves cases with more
than two heads, but refuses to do a complex merge that needs
manual resolution. It is primarily meant to be used for
bundling topic branch heads together. This is the default
merge strategy when pulling or merging more than one
branch.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">ours</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This resolves any number of
heads, but the resulting tree of the merge is always that of
the current branch head, effectively ignoring all changes
from all other branches. It is meant to be used to supersede
old development history of side branches. Note that this is
different from the &minus;Xours option to the
<i>recursive</i> merge strategy.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">subtree</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This is a modified recursive
strategy. When merging trees A and B, if B corresponds to a
subtree of A, B is first adjusted to match the tree
structure of A, instead of reading the trees at the same
level. This adjustment is also done to the common ancestor
tree.</p>

<h2>CONFIGURATION
<a name="CONFIGURATION"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">merge.conflictstyle</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Specify the style in which
conflicted hunks are written out to working tree files upon
merge. The default is &quot;merge&quot;, which shows a
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; conflict marker, changes made
by one side, a ======= marker, changes made by the other
side, and then a &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; marker. An
alternate style, &quot;diff3&quot;, adds a ||||||| marker
and the original text before the ======= marker.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">merge.defaultToUpstream</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">If merge is called without any
commit argument, merge the upstream branches configured for
the current branch by using their last observed values
stored in their remote&minus;tracking branches. The values
of the branch.&lt;current branch&gt;.merge that name the
branches at the remote named by branch.&lt;current
branch&gt;.remote are consulted, and then they are mapped
via remote.&lt;remote&gt;.fetch to their corresponding
remote&minus;tracking branches, and the tips of these
tracking branches are merged.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">merge.ff</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">By default, Git does not create
an extra merge commit when merging a commit that is a
descendant of the current commit. Instead, the tip of the
current branch is fast&minus;forwarded. When set to false,
this variable tells Git to create an extra merge commit in
such a case (equivalent to giving the
&minus;&minus;no&minus;ff option from the command line).
When set to only, only such fast&minus;forward merges are
allowed (equivalent to giving the
&minus;&minus;ff&minus;only option from the command
line).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">merge.log</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">In addition to branch names,
populate the log message with at most the specified number
of one&minus;line descriptions from the actual commits that
are being merged. Defaults to false, and true is a synonym
for 20.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">merge.renameLimit</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The number of files to consider
when performing rename detection during a merge; if not
specified, defaults to the value of diff.renameLimit.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">merge.renormalize</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Tell Git that canonical
representation of files in the repository has changed over
time (e.g. earlier commits record text files with CRLF line
endings, but recent ones use LF line endings). In such a
repository, Git can convert the data recorded in commits to
a canonical form before performing a merge to reduce
unnecessary conflicts. For more information, see section
&quot;Merging branches with differing checkin/checkout
attributes&quot; in <b>gitattributes</b>(5).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">merge.stat</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Whether to print the diffstat
between ORIG_HEAD and the merge result at the end of the
merge. True by default.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">merge.tool</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Controls which merge tool is
used by <b>git-mergetool</b>(1). The list below shows the
valid built&minus;in values. Any other value is treated as a
custom merge tool and requires that a corresponding
mergetool.&lt;tool&gt;.cmd variable is defined.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">merge.verbosity</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Controls the amount of output
shown by the recursive merge strategy. Level 0 outputs
nothing except a final error message if conflicts were
detected. Level 1 outputs only conflicts, 2 outputs
conflicts and file changes. Level 5 and above outputs
debugging information. The default is level 2. Can be
overridden by the <i>GIT_MERGE_VERBOSITY</i> environment
variable.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">merge.&lt;driver&gt;.name</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Defines a human&minus;readable
name for a custom low&minus;level merge driver. See
<b>gitattributes</b>(5) for details.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">merge.&lt;driver&gt;.driver</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Defines the command that
implements a custom low&minus;level merge driver. See
<b>gitattributes</b>(5) for details.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">merge.&lt;driver&gt;.recursive</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Names a low&minus;level merge
driver to be used when performing an internal merge between
common ancestors. See <b>gitattributes</b>(5) for
details.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">branch.&lt;name&gt;.mergeoptions</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Sets default options for
merging into branch &lt;name&gt;. The syntax and supported
options are the same as those of <i>git merge</i>, but
option values containing whitespace characters are currently
not supported.</p>
