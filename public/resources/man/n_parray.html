<h2>INTRODUCTION
<a name="INTRODUCTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Tcl includes a
library of Tcl procedures for commonly-needed functions. The
procedures defined in the Tcl library are generic ones
suitable for use by many different applications. The
location of the Tcl library is returned by the <b>info
library</b> command. In addition to the Tcl library, each
application will normally have its own library of support
procedures as well; the location of this library is normally
given by the value of the <b>$</b><i>app</i><b>_library</b>
global variable, where <i>app</i> is the name of the
application. For example, the location of the Tk library is
kept in the variable <b>$tk_library</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To access the
procedures in the Tcl library, an application should source
the file <b>init.tcl</b> in the library, for example with
the Tcl command</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>source [file join [info
library] init.tcl]</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">If the library procedure
<b>Tcl_Init</b> is invoked from an application&rsquo;s
<b>Tcl_AppInit</b> procedure, this happens automatically.
The code in <b>init.tcl</b> will define the <b>unknown</b>
procedure and arrange for the other procedures to be loaded
on-demand using the auto-load mechanism defined below.</p>

<h2>COMMAND PROCEDURES
<a name="COMMAND PROCEDURES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
procedures are provided in the Tcl library: <b><br>
auto_execok</b> <i>cmd</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Determines whether there is an
executable file or shell builtin by the name <i>cmd</i>. If
so, it returns a list of arguments to be passed to
<b>exec</b> to execute the executable file or shell builtin
named by <i>cmd</i>. If not, it returns an empty string.
This command examines the directories in the current search
path (given by the PATH environment variable) in its search
for an executable file named <i>cmd</i>. On Windows
platforms, the search is expanded with the same directories
and file extensions as used by <b>exec</b>.
<b>Auto_execok</b> remembers information about previous
searches in an array named <b>auto_execs</b>; this avoids
the path search in future calls for the same <i>cmd</i>. The
command <b>auto_reset</b> may be used to force
<b>auto_execok</b> to forget its cached information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>auto_import</b>
<i>pattern</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>Auto_import</b> is invoked
during <b>namespace import</b> to see if the imported
commands specified by <i>pattern</i> reside in an autoloaded
library. If so, the commands are loaded so that they will be
available to the interpreter for creating the import links.
If the commands do not reside in an autoloaded library,
<b>auto_import</b> does nothing. The pattern matching is
performed according to the matching rules of <b>namespace
import</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>auto_load</b> <i>cmd</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This command attempts to load
the definition for a Tcl command named <i>cmd</i>. To do
this, it searches an <i>auto-load path</i>, which is a list
of one or more directories. The auto-load path is given by
the global variable <b>$auto_path</b> if it exists. If there
is no <b>$auto_path</b> variable, then the TCLLIBPATH
environment variable is used, if it exists. Otherwise the
auto-load path consists of just the Tcl library directory.
Within each directory in the auto-load path there must be a
file <b>tclIndex</b> that describes one or more commands
defined in that directory and a script to evaluate to load
each of the commands. The <b>tclIndex</b> file should be
generated with the <b>auto_mkindex</b> command. If
<i>cmd</i> is found in an index file, then the appropriate
script is evaluated to create the command. The
<b>auto_load</b> command returns 1 if <i>cmd</i> was
successfully created. The command returns 0 if there was no
index entry for <i>cmd</i> or if the script did not actually
define <i>cmd</i> (e.g. because index information is out of
date). If an error occurs while processing the script, then
that error is returned. <b>Auto_load</b> only reads the
index information once and saves it in the array
<b>auto_index</b>; future calls to <b>auto_load</b> check
for <i>cmd</i> in the array rather than re-reading the index
files. The cached index information may be deleted with the
command <b>auto_reset</b>. This will force the next
<b>auto_load</b> command to reload the index database from
disk.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>auto_mkindex</b> <i>dir
pattern pattern ...</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Generates an index suitable for
use by <b>auto_load</b>. The command searches <i>dir</i> for
all files whose names match any of the <i>pattern</i>
arguments (matching is done with the <b>glob</b> command),
generates an index of all the Tcl command procedures defined
in all the matching files, and stores the index information
in a file named <b>tclIndex</b> in <i>dir</i>. If no pattern
is given a pattern of <b>*.tcl</b> will be assumed. For
example, the command</p>

<p style="margin-left:32%;"><b>auto_mkindex foo
*.tcl</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">will read all
the <b>.tcl</b> files in subdirectory <b>foo</b> and
generate a new index file <b>foo/tclIndex</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Auto_mkindex</b>
parses the Tcl scripts by sourcing them into a slave
interpreter and monitoring the proc and namespace commands
that are executed. Extensions can use the (undocumented)
auto_mkindex_parser package to register other commands that
can contribute to the auto_load index. You will have to read
through auto.tcl to see how this works.</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Auto_mkindex_old</b>
parses the Tcl scripts in a relatively unsophisticated way:
if any line contains the word <b>proc</b> as its first
characters then it is assumed to be a procedure definition
and the next word of the line is taken as the
procedure&rsquo;s name. Procedure definitions that do not
appear in this way (e.g. they have spaces before the
<b>proc</b>) will not be indexed. If your script contains
&ldquo;dangerous&rdquo; code, such as global initialization
code or procedure names with special characters like
<b>$</b>, <b>*</b>, <b>[</b> or <b>]</b>, you are safer
using auto_mkindex_old.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>auto_reset</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Destroys all the information
cached by <b>auto_execok</b> and <b>auto_load</b>. This
information will be re-read from disk the next time it is
needed. <b>Auto_reset</b> also deletes any procedures listed
in the auto-load index, so that fresh copies of them will be
loaded the next time that they are used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>auto_qualify</b> <i>command
namespace</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Computes a list of fully
qualified names for <i>command</i>. This list mirrors the
path a standard Tcl interpreter follows for command lookups:
first it looks for the command in the current namespace, and
then in the global namespace. Accordingly, if <i>command</i>
is relative and <i>namespace</i> is not <b>::</b>, the list
returned has two elements: <i>command</i> scoped by
<i>namespace</i>, as if it were a command in the
<i>namespace</i> namespace; and <i>command</i> as if it were
a command in the global namespace. Otherwise, if either
<i>command</i> is absolute (it begins with <b>::</b>), or
<i>namespace</i> is <b>::</b>, the list contains only
<i>command</i> as if it were a command in the global
namespace.</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Auto_qualify</b>
is used by the auto-loading facilities in Tcl, both for
producing auto-loading indexes such as <i>pkgIndex.tcl</i>,
and for performing the actual auto-loading of functions at
runtime.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>tcl_findLibrary</b>
<i>basename version patch initScript enVarName
varName</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This is a standard search
procedure for use by extensions during their initialization.
They call this procedure to look for their script library in
several standard directories. The last component of the name
of the library directory is normally <i>basenameversion</i>
(e.g., tk8.0), but it might be &ldquo;library&rdquo; when in
the build hierarchies. The <i>initScript</i> file will be
sourced into the interpreter once it is found. The directory
in which this file is found is stored into the global
variable <i>varName</i>. If this variable is already defined
(e.g., by C code during application initialization) then no
searching is done. Otherwise the search looks in these
directories: the directory named by the environment variable
<i>enVarName</i>; relative to the Tcl library directory;
relative to the executable file in the standard installation
bin or bin/<i>arch</i> directory; relative to the executable
file in the current build tree; relative to the executable
file in a parallel build tree.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>parray</b>
<i>arrayName</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Prints on standard output the
names and values of all the elements in the array
<i>arrayName</i>. <b>ArrayName</b> must be an array
accessible to the caller of <b>parray</b>. It may be either
local or global.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>tcl_endOfWord</b> <i>str
start</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Returns the index of the first
end-of-word location that occurs after a starting index
<i>start</i> in the string <i>str</i>. An end-of-word
location is defined to be the first non-word character
following the first word character after the starting point.
Returns -1 if there are no more end-of-word locations after
the starting point. See the description of
<b>tcl_wordchars</b> and <b>tcl_nonwordchars</b> below for
more details on how Tcl determines which characters are word
characters.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>tcl_startOfNextWord</b>
<i>str start</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Returns the index of the first
start-of-word location that occurs after a starting index
<i>start</i> in the string <i>str</i>. A start-of-word
location is defined to be the first word character following
a non-word character. Returns &minus;1 if there are no more
start-of-word locations after the starting point.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>tcl_startOfPreviousWord</b>
<i>str start</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Returns the index of the first
start-of-word location that occurs before a starting index
<i>start</i> in the string <i>str</i>. Returns &minus;1 if
there are no more start-of-word locations before the
starting point.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>tcl_wordBreakAfter</b>
<i>str start</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Returns the index of the first
word boundary after the starting index <i>start</i> in the
string <i>str</i>. Returns &minus;1 if there are no more
boundaries after the starting point in the given string. The
index returned refers to the second character of the pair
that comprises a boundary.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>tcl_wordBreakBefore</b>
<i>str start</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Returns the index of the first
word boundary before the starting index <i>start</i> in the
string <i>str</i>. Returns &minus;1 if there are no more
boundaries before the starting point in the given string.
The index returned refers to the second character of the
pair that comprises a boundary.</p>

<h2>VARIABLES
<a name="VARIABLES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
global variables are defined or used by the procedures in
the Tcl library: <b><br>
auto_execs</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Used by <b>auto_execok</b> to
record information about whether particular commands exist
as executable files.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>auto_index</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Used by <b>auto_load</b> to
save the index information read from disk.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>auto_noexec</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If set to any value, then
<b>unknown</b> will not attempt to auto-exec any
commands.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>auto_noload</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If set to any value, then
<b>unknown</b> will not attempt to auto-load any
commands.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>auto_path</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If set, then it must contain a
valid Tcl list giving directories to search during auto-load
operations. This variable is initialized during startup to
contain, in order: the directories listed in the TCLLIBPATH
environment variable, the directory named by the
$tcl_library variable, the parent directory of $tcl_library,
the directories listed in the $tcl_pkgPath variable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>env(TCL_LIBRARY)</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If set, then it specifies the
location of the directory containing library scripts (the
value of this variable will be assigned to the
<b>tcl_library</b> variable and therefore returned by the
command <b>info library</b>). If this variable is not set
then a default value is used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>env(TCLLIBPATH)</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If set, then it must contain a
valid Tcl list giving directories to search during auto-load
operations. Directories must be specified in Tcl format,
using &ldquo;/&rdquo; as the path separator, regardless of
platform. This variable is only used when initializing the
<b>auto_path</b> variable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>tcl_nonwordchars</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This variable contains a
regular expression that is used by routines like
<b>tcl_endOfWord</b> to identify whether a character is part
of a word or not. If the pattern matches a character, the
character is considered to be a non-word character. On
Windows platforms, spaces, tabs, and newlines are considered
non-word characters. Under Unix, everything but numbers,
letters and underscores are considered non-word
characters.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>tcl_wordchars</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This variable contains a
regular expression that is used by routines like
<b>tcl_endOfWord</b> to identify whether a character is part
of a word or not. If the pattern matches a character, the
character is considered to be a word character. On Windows
platforms, words are comprised of any character that is not
a space, tab, or newline. Under Unix, words are comprised of
numbers, letters or underscores.</p>
